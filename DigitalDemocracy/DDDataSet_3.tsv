1	Jones	Brian	42	b4gDbT98z6E	22	59	Is there any public testimony regarding this part of the hearing? If the sergeants can assist the speakers? Welcome and if you can state your name. Tell us who you are and representing.
2	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	i9llaC_1rmE	37	60	This is the you snooze you lose group, right? We're, we're here, thank you very much, Mister Chair. I and Mister Chair. I wanted to thank the committee for the technical amendments to the bill, which are now in print. And stipulate that this bill would apply to veterans hired on or after January 1, 2016. So if there's no concern about that.
3	Beall	Jim	92	2aI5J_1P430	1671	1698	I think the Governor's proposal tried to do that, but I think when we finalize what we're doing, we have to get to a point where as a policy we're recognizing the very fact that fuel efficiency is part of the future that we're trying to deal with here. It's just gonna be here. The costs of the roads, interesting enough, don't change.
4	Pavley	Fran	104	oUB8meWTgiM	1519	1539	Yes, and there's many. Right. It's not limited to here and I think I said that earlier on, but it's very frustrating. I haven't served on the budget subcommittee on this since I was in the assembly and it was my ongoing mantra for six years as chair there and people gradually got the hint.
5	Hueso	Ben	48	RuFiLUXgjss	1090	1116	So questions will be asked and you can argue on the one hand that this-- that there is more involved in cross examining a person than just asking questions. I'd like to know what that is because, you know, we also don't believe that anybody in particular should be terrorized or intimidated or harassed in that process.
6	Galgiani	Cathleen	95	1JV-wI6cFUY	866	891	But, in my district, to take away the tool for law enforcement would be absolutely detrimental because we have a different problem that's unique in my area, and I want to preface what I'm about to talk about it by saying that in no way do I mean to tie homelessness with crime. Not at all, not at all.
7	Chau	Ed	116	-1v9avmnxCY	651	668	One, it has to be within one half mile of a major transit stop, and by that we mean either ferry, rail or intersection of buses for example, that would provide services every 15 minutes.
8	Atkins	Toni	110	EgZgFkyj3MQ	1187	1217	Having previously concluded diplomatic assignments in Hong Kong, Malaysia, China, Austria, Sri Lanka, as well as serving in various capacities in India's Ministry of External Affairs. I did share with him this would be his best post, just so you know. Prior to his posting in San Francisco this past November of 2014, ambassador served as India's ambassador to the republic of Zimbabwe and later as ambassador to the Czech Republic.
9	Thurmond	Tony	4	nugSHhjUz14	565	579	Thank you, Madame Chair, for your leadership on the budget process and the subcommittee process, and thank you. Yes, I will miss our hearings, two five hour hearings a week. I will truly miss it, wrong text.
10	Leno	Mark	60	Q3p12T-SoaE	164	177	And over the years, we have done, although we've done much to remove some of the hurdles that have been in place, for example, we were the last state get rid of the need for fingerprinting.
11	Hueso	Ben	48	GUxOzh3Wh0Q	1688	1700	So it's all, it's a comprehensive effort and I think we're not talking about enormous amounts of plants, and thereby not really talking about an enormous amount of money.
12	Gipson	Mike	28	Y_pbsK-_qw0	893	909	But we're looking at ways to continue this pipeline that exists in our state, more prisons, lack of opportunities for students going to college, and things of that nature. And so I think this is a step in the right direction and I'm enthusiastically supporting it. Thank you.
13	Gipson	Mike	28	-F9OB-5fyEQ	465	499	The Auditor, I have requested an audit to be done to assess the University's progress as well as determine how this has improved the transparency through the budget process that I believe that this body as well as California's taxpayers strongly demand. I wanna thank the presenters for presenting to this body today, my colleagues as well, we're gonna have some final comments by the Chair of Higher Education, Mr. Medina.
14	Hill	Jerry	66	2W00giXvusA	1295	1318	Is that it, Mark? You have that? On page five of six in the analysis?  No, it's just amendments to be taken in appropriations or on the floor that deal with the issues. And if they're not resolved, then we would certainly reserve the right to bring the bill back to the committee for review.
15	Bonilla	Susan	3	VFoe5hvDs-o	36	54	They are professionals who work in laboratory settings. They're best known for examining gynecological tissue samples to identify cancer. Cytologists work under the direct on-site supervision of a laboratory director, who is responsible for ensuring that all personnel have the proper competency, training, and experience to perform all testing.
16	Cannella	Anthony	61	Ydll29eHOng	958	978	He was a graduate of Saint Mary's college with a degree in business administration and economics. Guillermo was a stellar advocate for the community; he was at everything. Regardless of what the event was, he was a great representative for the City of Ceres. As Council Member, he was most proud of an effort we undertook to build a new community center
17	Beall	Jim	92	_yhFBNo6QkM	9	27	I don't know if my statistics are right, but I think the general thought is there, so. We have Jessica Peters, thank you for coming Jessica, from the Legislative Analyst's Office, and you're presenting us with your report, so why don't you proceed. Thank you.
18	Hertzberg	Robert	99	3cRtgxQLQsI	1335	1350	And so the state's trying to step in to say, we need to come up with a hammer, multi $1000 fine, so these processes to make those laws work. One of the things we discussed, we never got very far, which is used in a number of other areas in businesses license and other areas is silver platter doctrine.
19	Wolk	Lois	94	SwF1WjZp4L4	948	969	can't get your, that those who oversee can't get their arms around. Would it be, I would like to suggest that before the May revise that the LAO, the staff, and Mr. Morales and any suggestions you have Mr. Thompson
20	Bonta	Rob	85	bHho7H6wssE	964	974	Thank you Mr. Dababneh for bringing this bill forward, it's a great bill, I'm very pleased and happy to be able to support it today and I just wanted to respectfully request that I be added as a co-author at the next appropriate time. Thank you.
21	Bonta	Rob	85	SQe4IQVjZKc	58	75	Final question, does the department feel that any expansion of dental managed care would be an appropriate route to take given the challenges that exist with beneficiaries receiving access to care through the fee-for-service program or is that not something you're interested in?
22	Mullin	Kevin	31	hGRwdCC6_e8	506	514	All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote, clerk will close the roll and tally the vote.
23	Wood	Jim	72	qbDN-8u61LI	1626	1643	So, I look forward to continuing to collaborate with you because I think that's how we're gonna get this across the finish line, and my hope is that we actually get a product that can actually be supported by both houses and the Governor, to move this issue forward.
24	Bloom	Richard	2	f4QHrQX2iQw	1617	1643	And note that we have ... And we begin with... Mr. Gordon, you had questions on Issue 4 on the vote only calendar that were appropriately addressed to the Energy Commission.
25	Grove	Shannon	77	xhI7BgS1JK0	1351	1363	And then I applaud and I thank my colleague over here for asking those questions cuz I appreciate you taking the amendments on the finance piece, but I have real concerns about section 2.2 as well.
26	Lara	Ricardo	107	SdYdT8y72Ng	1097	1108	These kids deserve these funds, and so I think, as we move forward, I'm hopefully seeing a compromise that will affect a small group of schools and I think only two school districts.
27	De Leon	Kevin	102	mgO95LX_sqE	849	869	And the reality is, Mr. Wolfe does a wonderful job with his advocacy. A little perhaps rigidity with regards to Bradley-Burns because one of the things we need to deal with is sustained economic growth, especially for the thirteenth largest economy, which is L.A. County.
28	Steinorth	Marc	35	2w72Z1tf27E	385	421	AB 1342 has found and struck a balance between the disabled, the business, and the legal communities. This is unique. The broad support is a recognition of the valuable role the CCDA can play in aligning the needs of these three communities. It is supported by Disability Rights of California, Cal Chamber, and the California Business Properties Association, and also the Consumer Attorneys of California. This bill also clarifies the information provided by commercial property owners to tenants, clearly delineating whether the property has received an access inspection or not. I respectfully ask for your support.
29	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	nugSHhjUz14	1729	1760	Again, this very encouraging, not only are we reducing the number of beds, but we have probably got an opportunity, hopefully in the future, at brining the out of state beds back into California. We have people as far as Mississippi and Texas were housing prisoners, we need to bring them back home, once we get our numbers down. We need to do it cautiously. And, one day we may even be able to even close a prison, which has been unprecedented and never been done before. And I believe there's some talk about that.
30	Mullin	Kevin	31	iDZCoA28Gzg	69	86	Unfortunately, the authorizing statutes of the CCI excluded dual eligible individuals with developmental disabilities from enrolling. To address this population, the health plan of San Mateo has implemented a special needs plan that provides similar coordinated services.
31	Berryhill	Tom	54	R5jZe-4pYBI	1245	1260	Yeah this, just as a closing comment, this has been a very difficult bill because we're kinda caught in the middle of a political football here and so it makes it very difficult for us, so i'll take it all into consideration. I still haven't made up mind.
32	Calderon	Ian Charles	115	22ufHgqGK-A	1485	1497	Who purchase time shares and prevent time share owners from having their personal information sold the third parties including any of those entities that use the information for fraudulent purposes and since we do have a motion a second,
33	Mitchell	Holly	64	lZ5SEmNPh-U	1589	1596	I think so. Let's do all three cuz I'm sure the folks who are lined up want to probably touch on all three issues, so we'll do public comment all at once. So keep rolling.
34	Bloom	Richard	2	FoNfxHNdVgI	346	369	Our next hearing is going to be on April 15th, and again I encourage you to bring your cap and trade issues with you then. And with that, I would like to ask if any of the members here on the dais have any comments they would like to add. Welcome Mr. Williams, thanks for being here and I would now like to ask our first two speakers to step forward.
35	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	23L8yaBtAnI	148	173	I know as I start talking about this, I got an email from a woman in my district, her name was Maria and she said that this year this year her mother would have to leave at 6:00 AM because KMart decided the people may want to shop at that time and she was told that she wasn't sure what time should be let go to go home. No advanced schedule, no notice, minimum wage.
36	Block	Marty	59	Htnfsa9QnRM	2008	2021	And that's a great value, so to me it's not so much about parents having access to the information, as schools knowing that everybody has access to information, and they better clean up their act or clean up their vents at least.
37	Chau	Ed	116	2X-V6mACHAA	255	267	So there's a lot of kind of fireworks going on there as well. So I want to thank you for your work. And so if there are no further comments or questions, would you like to close?
38	Nazarian	Adrin	36	KzIfF7fCyGE	1978	2010	throughout the world banning some of the-- some of the services provided by these companies. And so, all this bill does is put in certain provisions that will ensure that the drivers that are being accepted into the program have gone through certain measures to ensure public safety.
39	Allen	Benjamin	70	DcIk90J9Qng	534	554	And I just wanted to sort of express my support for the comments made by, the gentleman just just now about the importance of libraries and making sure that the governor doesn't forget them, as you know, in the context of the negotiation. So whatever I can do to lend my support and help on that effort, I'd like to just make that very clear.
40	Berryhill	Tom	54	3CsrxcXxpcI	735	756	I'm happy, Madam Chair, to accept all three of the committee amendments suggested in this analysis, and members, while it's hard to predict with absolute certainty, to what extent SB 345 will boost license sales, what we do know is that the status quo absolutely is not working.
41	McGuire	Mike	93	zWP9Ch_UvEs	1139	1157	In San Francisco like in Sonoma County, we shouldn't be forced to negotiate or in the case of Malibu, use a subpoena in a two year court fight to have big corporations simply follow local laws. Furthermore, all this bill does is ensure that those who wish to rent their properties can do so legally.
42	Leno	Mark	60	1XQMI2ofb7Y	1391	1406	We'll work through probably a couple dozen subcommittee hearings over the next couple of months so that we can a full budget committee craft a bipartisan budget to get to the conference committee by beginning of June.
43	Wieckowski	Bob	55	8y2PS2BPMgc	413	425	Cuz I see that we're going from 25,000 to 23,000 in the language and I thought that the fuel may be the difference, or that maybe the equipment that was not in that was-
44	Quirk	Bill	23	C3fC_QKuL0U	304	318	I'm hoping to learn a lot today and again, I wanna thank Chair Cooper for bringing this forward and as Chair of the Public Safety Committee, I will be listening very carefully to this to look at legislation in the future. Thank you.
45	Hertzberg	Robert	99	phnFAAdDWJg	1190	1204	Real quickly before we go to Nancy. Could we introduce a bill now to start the JPA process for purposes of capturing that pipe that Chairwoman Pavley talked about? Can we starting working on that now to get ahead of it? Because the world's going to change.
46	Liu	Carol	63	t4_AyYAahhk	547	571	But I am concerned about what I think this bill focuses on is inputs rather than outcomes for students. And I think we've worked really hard with student success task force to develop recommendations aimed at improving the outcomes for students, not so worried about faculty.
47	Hertzberg	Robert	99	2QITrr6350o	1353	1360	So if you're going to leave, you've already paid that portion of rent, right? That goes to the point, so you pay in advance on rent, you never pay in arrears.
48	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	_0FvACJKmKc	742	753	We want to get this resolved. We have an opportunity to have this heard in January and to put an urgency on the bill so that it will become effective immediately.
49	Ting	Philip	30	jHspOFmZl3U	967	993	All right, I guess, given all our efforts at really trying to increase in-state enrollment, can you talk to us why. Given all our efforts to really up in-state enrollment, I'm a little bit surprised to see nonresident enrollment actually going up. I would have thought it at least would have been flat this year. So if you could help us understand why it's going up, we've been really working very hard to try to keep it at the same level it was previous years.
50	De Leon	Kevin	102	wxAms1gWFJA	2360	2376	And quite frankly and I've said this before and I'll say it again. I think if Howard Jarvis had to drive today in LA County roads. I think Howard Jarvis would be leading the fight to pass this measure before the voters, you know. I think that's what Howard Jarvis would do, you know.
51	Mullin	Kevin	31	LW2wm2tITKQ	1534	1550	To do this, AB 464 lifts the cap on district taxes from 2% to 3%. Any local tax increase would require voter approval, a majority vote for general purpose taxes and a two-thirds vote for any taxes that would go to special purposes.
52	Hertzberg	Robert	99	GL6n7Ol5uP8	702	720	What's really happened? How many people have come back? No one's coming back, because the market works in a lot of ways. We have resource adequacy to make sure there's level of protections. We have the investor owned utilities, despite what they told you today. I have a letter in the file that said they don't have an objection to the numbers and what happened.
53	Moorlach	John	4657	07ilphfHuEw	867	887	Mirror bills. Ok, since I'm up. Colleagues, first of all I'd like to say thanks, I've had a great six months and just want to thank everybody for the opportunity to serve with you. It's been a real pleasure. I spent eight years as a supervisor so I've done on negotiations of contracts with employees.
54	Allen	Benjamin	70	0J9n2c3eCds	1429	1451	I think a lot of folks are concerned about the collective impact of all of the pumping and how that's going to impact a lot of people so I think that's probably the crux of the challenge here. Mr. Woodley you brought up the agencies and that I think maybe is one of the strongest arguments you have for the bill
55	Pavley	Fran	104	45ZR2HT6sPs	355	371	The answer to any of those questions was we don't know, we don't keep records. So that was the original beginning of this before. And part of this before, and I worked very collaboratively with the oil companies. I'm sure they would state that.
56	Wieckowski	Bob	55	1-lHMg2FsZ4	14	38	This is a jobs bill to ensure that single taxation of new vehicles sold in California to out of state purchasers. I've, want to thank the committee for their work on the analysis. I want to address the point that was, raised in the analysis. I will be, with the Chair's agreement, I'll be taking an amendment to address this, risk of tax, evasion.
57	Gomez	Jimmy	80	QXW5aikdMmE	83	108	Those were the monsters. Those are the big ones. Resources and utilities. AB 33, Quirk, climate change, Advisor Council, do pass with amendments to rename and establish the Advisor Council at the Energy Commission and modify the duties of the Energy Commission. Republicans not voting.
58	Glazer	Steve	10481	4lx0MqjDD6Q	1577	1605	Assemblyman, I think that you could probably look to many people who have committed great horrors in the world. And find some examples where you might say they were a good family man. They took care of their staff in a kind way. They were generous to charity. And so, in each of these cases I think we have to understand the magnitude of what we're analyzing and examining.
59	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	cXnV6IOLWSg	1222	1264	Thank you Madame President and colleagues on behalf of the new father whose wife had their first baby this morning. Das Williams asked that I present this bill on his behalf.  Beautiful little baby girl born this morning on the day she was due. This is extraordinary. I think that's last time she'll pay attention to what any grown-up has to say if she's like her dad. So here we go. This is a district bill.
60	Obernolte	Jay	86	GxQLQjba08A	1026	1041	Okay, I'm not trying to be critical of your efforts, but I'm just wondering where the disconnect is. Is it that you did not understand that to be part of a zero based budget when you set out to create the report? Is that the reason why that information wasn't there?
61	Hertzberg	Robert	99	k4GcCA0Jbo4	228	237	We're just simply taking out the sunset out of that to continue to allow a body to advocate for, the taxpayers. We have the franchise tax board here, ask for an aye vote.
62	Grove	Shannon	77	DrSDPcgi_-A	1157	1183	So if somebody applies for 7,500 slots, or multiple people apply, that slot is funded for what period of time? - For one year - For that 7,500 slots that were funded, or in this case 10,000, I'd like you to use the one that was actually funded the 10,000. What was the cost of funding those 10,000 slots? Does anybody have that?
63	Wood	Jim	72	81AHHgExKGE	1970	2000	Yes, thank you. And I met with the author yesterday. We had some discussions, and I will tell you, I'm a bit conflicted. Partnership Health is the plan that administers in every county that I represent and it's very rare that I've heard in the past of a managed healthcare plan for MediCal that actually works really, really well, and it does. So, I am conflicted when I hear from them that this will incur additional costs to them and beyond.
64	Wieckowski	Bob	55	ZMZhi0vPE74	1114	1133	So I don't know what other non-gold, non-mercury elements that may be in here that may raise the concern of the state Water Board that you'd want to be consistent, but it seems like it's an exact prohibition if you find any destruction.
65	Bonta	Rob	85	Di5WyuYmeiA	257	271	All the health committee members should have those in front of you. I'm just going to walk through each one quickly and I'm going to need tp ask a clarifying question of the author on one of the amendments to make sure we are on the same page. Let me just go through those.
66	Thurmond	Tony	4	DrSDPcgi_-A	1351	1386	That's Assembly Member Chiu's city alone, right? That's San Francisco spots for one city if that's the best we can do. So since it's a tough question, we'll let you think about it, ruminate on it I am going to come back to Miss Ramos and ask for you to clarify for me. When you talked about when, we couldn't fill 7,400 slots. Whats behind that? Whats the challenge here? I would think that the demand would be so great that would be able to fill those full time slots and then some. I understand, some families may want part time slots, I get that.
67	Bates	Pat	58	2Dc5I9_7zFA	2037	2049	And so I think, having something that's cookie cutter for every community just doesn't cut it. It really needs to have more specificity in terms of what the population is.
68	Alejo	Luis	9	uR7IVED3sSY	1010	1021	From the adoption of the CVRA, it has resulted in the opportunity for school districts, community college districts, and cities to move to district based elections. Although moving to district-based elections has benefited many communities, there are still some committees that have been subject to poorly drawn districts.
69	Hernandez	Ed	103	8_WRsqziEsc	1709	1730	in California, have with dental, and that was comparing Texas at 63% with the utilization rate. Is the department planning, which it's obviously required to, to annually review the reimbursement levels for physician and dental services? Are you planning on doing those reviews, and when?
70	Bloom	Richard	2	FUMnQyMymrQ	1408	1425	The statement that you made about 43%. A pass/fail rate being consistent with where we are in the past. Do we ever compare ourselves to other states and take note of what their practices are? Just generally, not specifically to AB60.
71	Hernandez	Ed	103	UmXyuczgH_s	1206	1226	Yeah, and I'm just trying to figure, I know the mix, the percentage was based on other states, I believe, but I'm just wondering if that's enough, and I'm not suggesting the change, but if that's enough incentive to get the patient to actually come in and more importantly get the vaccination.
72	Irwin	Jacqui	16	G0q0929_P6I	196	211	Due to the nature of this issue we are only as strong as our weakest link. Our smallest or most outdated computer networks have access to vital stores of data and critical networks that provide services to Californians.
73	Bloom	Richard	2	QruWeQOWjh0	534	560	Just a, a quick comment. I, I'm gonna say off of the bill today. I think that, you know, the, the price tag in an era of constrained resources is pretty high. But, I'd be a lot more inclined to support something like this, if I knew that the industry in California, that this's gonna to benefit I would say chiefly, our booming tech sector.
74	Weber	Shirley	44	0sKrxcyZVQA	1840	1859	Yes we have reached a compromise for tradeable language for the CAP HP body camera pilot program that would be one million dollars with budget bill language that would be contingent upon the fact If they come back with their plan or proposal as to how they would utilize one million.
75	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	gZ0_qo7XpYk	2324	2353	So that we are-- we're going to give them the flexibility necessary to make sure that California meets its climate goals while keeping the lights on. That's what the other mandate is. We don't want to squeeze anybody. We want to be able to balance the latest technologies with what it's going to take to keep these plants going while we integrate more and more renewable energy which we all know is somewhat less reliable.
76	Bonilla	Susan	3	ASNmI2rHU9I	880	907	I, I guess I'm trying to get to the, the usefulness of, of data. And I, understand, I think the certain note where it testified about, SEC filings. What is the difference between that information and the information that you're asking for beyond the fact that I guess you want a breakdown by drug?
77	Wood	Jim	72	iF8zLPAheNg	339	359	AB243 provides protections for the environment from illegal cultivation activities and served as the funding vehicle for the entire medical cannabis regulatory structure. Environmental protections include making the watershed enforcement team a pilot project created by Governor Brown in 2014 permanent and state-wide
78	Olsen	Kristin	15	G4RiUnTMom4	965	979	We felt it was appropriate based on the fact that we're not the experts in the education field, to defer the specifics of that development process to the State Board.
79	Pan	Richard	96	fNOTPzEYh_E	1547	1563	None of us can do that. But, I think that's what we need to see so that as I said, walking eyes wide open and also that way, there's no surprises. If we walk in and we have another slow down economy, and CSU comes back and says, hey, we're a little short, the issue is that building.
80	Leno	Mark	60	hSwKpjUIVVQ	1678	1693	And we did fund 500,000 in the 13 budget but they're at the end of their rope right now. And I don't know that we have a collective decision that were going to see, we want to see the commission on the status of women's sunset.
81	Wieckowski	Bob	55	en7JgK3RrhY	878	890	So that the workers in the valley or in Los Angeles can interconnect with the existing systems that we have, and I just, I know that there's, I know of prescriptions I wanted you to-
82	Block	Marty	59	Q1vYBQdDLNc	525	539	An amazing move and amazing change and Cindy has handled the change with incredible grace and skill so that she is now considered truly a model Superintendent here in California and throughout the country.
83	Hancock	Loni	98	uM-vqP4Hv8s	1388	1401	But I do want to clarify the Yo-Yo Ma issue if we can call it that. Because my reading of the bill was that it deals with contracted services.
84	Mitchell	Holly	64	rD0VjcELenc	953	968	Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary. Aye's - 36, no's - 0, the appointees are confirmed. Moving on to unfinished business, file item number 10, SCR 16. Mr. Secretary, please read.
85	Gray	Adam	27	8w4HbL8_L_s	295	315	More recently the Obama administration has put $5 million forward for the western state system. Could you both identify for the Committee how the California system is different than the overall system and how the funding needs correlate between the systems?
86	Wood	Jim	72	eOaXlPRJTVY	1426	1445	I was a little concerned, when I heard that, and this would be, trust me, as a former provider a shock of, a real shock to find out that I thought I was a provider in a network only to find out that I wasn't at some point. That is pretty disturbing and I could see that we might have some challenges around that.
87	De Leon	Kevin	102	8L1SsBHKNBQ	1423	1437	Okay. File item number four passes in a 5-0 vote. We'll go to floor acknowledgments on number 5 through number 11. Can we get a motion? Motion made by Ms. Leyva. Secretary please call the roll.
88	Liu	Carol	63	Ir2eiizDgdE	141	153	And tobacco free school district policy often gives school employees the added motivation needed to cut down tobacco use or quit altogether. And I ask for your aye vote.
89	Anderson	Joel	57	zO-5FwV_Tmk	1124	1137	Because what it does is it devalues what the tax is for, and then people can play these shell games, which ultimate leading to them being used as political pawns. They should be in the budget. They deserve to be in the budget.
90	Roth	Richard	106	0HDXR-Yl1D8	1213	1237	effort and money to educating and training business operators and providing ADA access specialists to help ensure access for all. In fact, I submit that if you ask a small business operator who received a building inspector's permit to operate today if he or she was good to go with regard to ADA access issues, he or she would probably say, of course.
91	Leyva	Connie	62	__RebzhDkwE	823	837	So I thank you for this very thorough packet. I appreciate it. I do understand there will be a cost involved but what is the cost if we do nothing for the students who go to school there and for those who, I wish you could have heard the young man. He was very eloquent.
92	Chiu	David	7	tr961U921gU	1621	1634	And that in so many parts of the state, so many parts of the state, there are millions of Californians that are struggling to make ends meet to be able to afford some of the most expensive housing in the country.
93	Williams	Das	12	n5MXFS_19l0	35	54	Instead, it is the intent of the legislature that the standards of discipline adopted and implemented by institutions be fair, objective, consistent and for the most egregious violations of the institution's sexual assault policies include a minimum of two years suspension up to a maximum of expulsion.
94	Quirk	Bill	23	Ikum-UrpZGs	1071	1082	All right, so, it's the newer models that are on the bottom here that have the least - If you look at the top, it includes all of them.
95	Medina	Jose	81	kp1XUyhSwnM	276	293	So, if they're... you have the county, school district, and community college all being involved... How do we get to the decision of which of those three entities becomes the fiscal administrator for the money?
96	Wood	Jim	72	-R4HGT4UbOs	2264	2285	I know the fish hatchery at Warm Springs Dam, the highway 101, that bypass overpass in Rohnert Park, the Crescent City Air Terminal, the 17 mile highway 101 bypass around Redwood National Park, but his fondest accomplishment was in establishing the Lady Bird Johnson Grove in the towering Redwood National Park.
97	Mendoza	Tony	52	ewcXToh_gOY	62	85	We also have added some mock, some mock up language, some actually some amendments, to, to be used in purposes pursuant in Section 8C of the California Constitution where we are looking to define a mechanism by which a second week of sales of fireworks can be responsibly implemented instead of just implemented, right.
98	McGuire	Mike	93	Iras-GLDTWk	2005	2021	SB 685 is a bipartisan proposal that will help veteran service organizations close the gap of services between the Department of Veteran Affairs programs and veterans, and tackle desperately needed deferred maintenance on veteran halls across California.
99	Atkins	Toni	110	8g5e-OGL0_Y	1185	1206	Thank you. "In the long adventure of their lives together, Erna and Andrew were terrific partners. Curious, generous, thoughtful, and creative in everything they did. Erna brightened every encounter and enriched every conversation. It was a delight to know her." Indeed it was. Our sympathies are with her family, the community of San
100	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	gZ0_qo7XpYk	454	472	In fact today, I think he ramped it up even higher than what he had previously. This measure SB 180 will help accomplish this goal by creating new emissions performance standards that limit the amount of carbon dioxide power plants may emit.
101	Leno	Mark	60	-8HmkVu5hs8	1735	1751	Do you believe that there's any way the wording could be massaged that might provide greater allowance within your concern for public safety for physicians to write that exemption?
102	Wieckowski	Bob	55	hOXjsAX0HBg	2217	2275	So I look forward to our next oversight hearing with the department. And now, I will convene the legislative hearing. And I thank you for appearing. This is part of our special order of the business. And we will hear SB 654 by Senator de Leon and SB 673 by Senator Lara. As I understand, Senator de Leon is unable to attend today's hearing. I did receive a copy of the Governor's press statement on Climate Adaptation which is timely. So, we'll hear Senator Lara will be presenting Senator de Leon's bill. We will proceed as a subcommittee as its-- have we have only two members. I'd like to welcome you Senator Lara. If you could start with your bill first--
103	Thurmond	Tony	4	2cybSlRCgP0	1178	1188	Thank you, a quick question for the author. How many agencies in the community have been identified that will be able to provide the need to those served at Sonoma in 2018.
104	Bloom	Richard	2	t0t13B_zyEs	1195	1221	My staff and sponsors I want to point out; are working very closely with industry and opposition as we did for much of the last year, and we believe that we've, I should say it appears is, we've reach consensus with all parties in terms of intention, and we've got an in-person meeting planned next week to discuss amendments.
105	Bonta	Rob	85	37JGlYuk31E	743	754	I don't want to take risks that might endanger my children. By the same token, I don't want my children exposed to unnecessary risk in the community. This is fundamentally a bill about public health.
106	Wood	Jim	72	jKVkIx_af_k	1673	1688	Comments I heard in governance and finance last week from patient advocates I'd like to address in advance, as I expect them to come up again. The bill, is the question or the comment was, the bill is more focused on outdoor growers and does not address indoor cultivation.
107	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	akOKQetVqu4	493	510	So, is there any possibility that gradual-- because of how low it is now, where if you start lower, then it does not grow at the same rate when they get to the, as voters mature?
108	Hernandez	Ed	103	WJQRNP9q0xQ	355	369	So, this bill is to allow the sanitation district to work with the cities to address the MS4 permit. Now, we did have some opposition and my commitment to the opposition was to, alleviate their concerns and we had some amendments.
109	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	BISvC49mosc	1618	1639	then get 3 paid sick days, because that was not the vision of this bill. And so quite frankly, I'm sorry that the Chamber seems to want to renegotiate a deal, we've renegotiated with them, we've negotiated the entire time with them, quite frankly. We negotiated with them last year to get the job killer label off, and every time they come back, they want to rewrite the rules.
110	McGuire	Mike	93	Pvh7fZV71H4	702	722	But, what we know is that every penny that we invest in these small commercial hub airports benefit your San Fransisco's, your San Jose's, your Sacramento's, and your LAX's because what that means is that you're actually gonna able to have additional aircraft coming from markets that aren't currently serving those larger hub airports.
111	Pavley	Fran	104	wPtjftt3FVU	414	428	It'll be in three volumes. They've completed Volume 1. I'm very interested in Volume 2 particularly, and perhaps Volume 3, that are supposed to be completed by also July 1, 2015.
112	Mitchell	Holly	64	lZ5SEmNPh-U	0	22	We'll move on to...thank you. Thank you very much. Item 4265 under the Department of Public Health. Got quite a few issues that we'll be hearing, one of which will require a vote, members. We'll start with the overview. Page 20 in the agenda.
113	Nazarian	Adrin	36	PeQL6v-QN50	1297	1314	Persia, has sustained and years later ...still recognized? Last year we celebrated notice for the first-time ...the call-in the Legislature in our house here and tis today marks the second annual year.
114	Chiu	David	7	skOoMkG_5XA	833	849	And, and I'm concerned that we are going to see rising premium rates, because we can't tackle the cost of high cost specialty drugs. So from my perspective, and I just want to say to colleagues, I think we're going to need to have a number of solutions to address this short-term and long-term and I do hope that we will all be able to work together to make that happen.
115	Patterson	Jim	119	ZHlQISHQoPg	691	707	There is a common thread that I hear from my district and up and down the state from Hispanic Chambers of Commerce and from others. We heard it from the Asian Pacific Chamber of Commerce. These are small minority-owned businesses. We say we wanna care about the people that we say we care about.
116	Wolk	Lois	94	cRT-vVNBfAE	119	147	That will be a key part of this budget and is really something to be very pleased about in terms of being in the middle of the drought. And which may continue, and lots of these projects that your local communities are ready to move forward to increase the savings of water and the more efficient use of water.
117	Leno	Mark	60	9_Ipr5dyo2o	317	338	It allows for the potential expenditure of hundreds of millions of bond proceeds for low and moderate income housing purposes, as well as other governmental purpose redevelopment projects. It facilitates the repayment of loans and other obligations by removing tax increment caps and time limit and funding limitations.
118	Hill	Jerry	66	KFPGF5cSaEI	534	547	the professional manner that they have, regardless of what we do it's not going to work. So I think that's where, at the end of the day those appointments and how that plays into it will be most critical but
119	Pan	Richard	96	BDjsPtF4Upk	882	894	And so, there's a lot of things that still need to be thought out about this bill, and we need to solve this problem. This is a very real problem. We need to solve it, but unfortunately this is not the appropriate solution at this and there's more work that needs to be done.
120	Pan	Richard	96	BDjsPtF4Upk	737	755	We still, I think that it should be a two-year bill, I think there's still time for people to work things out. We need to solve the problem, I've committed to the author that I want to work with him to resolve these issues. But, unfortunately at the nature of the bill as is right now, it's going to cause problems.
121	Hernandez	Roger	37	mRtWZWKaAFE	907	921	This is a requirement already in place for all the other paid-to-drive people in California requirement. Why are we cutting corners with people that have cool apps? Like, is it because it's hip? I mean so, for the author, would you
122	Quirk	Bill	23	UdyJhNk-vh8	1031	1059	And the governor expressed that we have to make sure law enforcement can use this as appropriate to make sure we prevent crime, and I am now working very hard with the sheriffs, and we'll work with the police chiefs as well, and see what we can do on that. So, with that, thank you very much and I respectfully request your aye vote.
123	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	ZhE_hzRecAQ	225	251	Seeing and hearing none, aye's - 39, no's - 0, the measure passes. We're going to go back to file item 131, and we're going to conclude that item. Senator Leno and file item 131, if you would, if you have an answer to that question and you might do this. I don't see any other mics up, so you may close.
124	Pavley	Fran	104	iupDRc3kcPY	785	796	 We're trying to figure out a way to do that. The only thing that was in AB 32 is some of the fees could go to administrative purpose, for the purpose of carb to implement the programs.
125	Lara	Ricardo	107	pchCRkcA1Ic	56	74	Many immigrants come to this country as refugees of serious oppression or in the most severe cases genocide in their countries. SB 291 will help communities and nonprofit organizations who serve individuals with trauma related to genocide access appropriate mental health services.
126	Lara	Ricardo	107	pchCRkcA1Ic	75	86	Specifically SB 291 will require an expansion to the definition of vulnerable communities in their health and safety code to include groups who have experienced trauma related to genocide.
127	McGuire	Mike	93	LwhIfxRQ9VM	831	843	We are here to be collaborative. But we can't wait another 10 years. Today's hearing is going to be focused on solutions, and we look forward to working with all of you. Not just now but in the months to come.
128	Hall	Isadore	1	z_QlsHBgTk4	31	52	Thank you Mr. Chair, members. SB 549 would allow professional sports franchises to operate game day 50/50 charitable raffles to benefit local charities in California. 50/50 charitable raffles are raffles in which 50% of the proceeds go towards the prize winner and 50% go to the local charities designated by the team.
129	Medina	Jose	81	BSQ4q6mJlLM	483	510	It was the same feeling that I had when I went to the Community College Board. And I wrote down efficiency, when I heard University of California speak of efficiency. But the same thing, in my mind, applies. As when I was a K-12 school board member, that I would not look for savings at the bottom.
130	Garcia	Eduardo	38	hrhrKD-uM2U	1141	1158	I do know that we personally have seen some benefit in terms of the minute that we've been able to buy though this system, where the doors to the fire station have opened up with the warning system.
131	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	z_QlsHBgTk4	1343	1354	And we could always expand it to include others cuz I think we even discussed minor league teams in it, but the opponents hated it so much we had to shrink it down.
132	Bloom	Richard	2	hkqFcKt5e3k	179	204	We can approve what are known as regrettable solutions, that may be well-intentioned but prove after the fact to be equally or more dangerous. An example of this was the disastrous use of MTBE as a fuel additive, ostensibly to reduce air pollution, a salutary goal, but as it turned out a disastrous water pollutant.
133	Beall	Jim	92	pr4Lpt1U5o4	473	485	And we put it on the Governor's desk and then it was vetoed. Okay, so we actually made this proposal. And everybody, it was a bipartisan proposal. We wanted to do Inspector General.
134	Hall	Isadore	1	w8RK3-qsxL8	190	199	Allowing them to be investors in, in this great land that we call America for all people. So again, thank you for your leadership. You may close and we'll, take the bill up. Thank you.
135	Hancock	Loni	98	qapPMGGQ0rI	1072	1090	So, personally, I would like to see this be a two-year bill, come up in January, and have a serious hearing on all of these issues. Cuz I think there are some real issues here that we have to deal with.
136	McGuire	Mike	93	LwhIfxRQ9VM	843	856	Without further ado. I'd like to better turn it over to the Senator, who I'm grateful for his work with health services. And the Senator's also going to be chairing the extraordinary session health and Human Services Committee. I'm grateful for you partnership.
137	Fuller	Jean	49	8L1SsBHKNBQ	884	911	But I you know, I did ask you to put together some talking points for me that basically would show how your actions in regards to reducing the fee, as you told me, were carried out. That I would then be able to win more votes on the floor for you if that were the case.
138	Wieckowski	Bob	55	CzqJO_Zd50k	82	89	With the longer burning forest fires and increased amount and we haven't got to the health effects from the people down in the flat lands as you indicated on your drive here this morning.
139	Gallagher	James	108	RK37B-MMwt0	463	484	Currently licensed repossesors who want to contest the assessment of an administrative fine or to appeal the denial of a license must embark on a process that can take sometimes upwards more than a year to obtain final resolution. A disciplinary review committee, as I'm proposing, will save the licensee time because matters can be resolved more quickly.
140	Alejo	Luis	9	gP-mCxG_DCU	524	539	People that pick our crops do the work that many do not want to do. If we give them a way to work lawfully and continue paying taxes, contributing and providing for their families, that is certainly going to be an economic benefit in the billions of dollars to California's economy.
141	Mitchell	Holly	64	7VfcnWx6nzU	29	46	I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this critical public policy issue, and our effort to protect California property owners from abuses in civil asset forfeiture, and to insure that law enforcement engaging in civil asset forfeiture, are subject to California state law.
142	Irwin	Jacqui	16	v8Lqd5JpuF0	313	331	However, in addition to the homes and the cemeteries, some of the department's larger roles are, approving schools' eligibility for GI Bill funds, programs for incarcerated veterans and a veterans services division, which performs many functions, including administering funding for the County Veterans Service Officers.
143	Hertzberg	Robert	99	6r30p-6PJFA	800	815	So, the bottom line is at every level, again, I only make these points is cuz it's important as we talk about these issues. The amount of time that's been put in this thing and how much energy I'm going to put into this over the next number of years, I want to set the record straight about where the law's been and where we are today.
144	Hernandez	Roger	37	3iSH1uuuz-E	1697	1722	Mr. Speaker, members, AB 1506 is backed by concurrence in Senate amendments. This bill will provide for the violations of the pay stub requirements involving the employer name and address, and the dates of the pay period. The employer would have a 33-day opportunity to cure the alleged violation before a pocket claim would be filed. This bill is supported by a large coalition of employers and others, and there is no opposition to the bill. I ask for your aye vote.
145	Hernandez	Ed	103	zO-5FwV_Tmk	289	304	And I am optimistic, but more importantly, committed to making sure that we have revenues that are available for the most vulnerable here in the State of California. So Mr. Chair and members, I want to thank you for allowing me to spend some time this morning to make this presentation.
146	Hill	Jerry	66	mxsKkg9J8wc	1211	1223	Seven. That bill has seven votes. We'll hold the roll open for absent members. Thank you very much, and congratulations. Move to item four, Assemblymember Bonilla, AB 486, welcome. How are you?
147	Roth	Richard	106	YKXU5BUfkbE	1229	1245	I appreciate this effort. My only concern always has been and continues to be, as we move money down to the local level, that as a state that we design appropriate accountability measures, goals and objectives and performance metrics.
148	Stone	Mark	20	4XOeWVTUKok	512	517	No, this would be giving the Chief the ability to say yes or no, because they're the ones that have a most direct relationship with the citizens of that city.
149	Bonilla	Susan	3	YNjNXr0cQTo	697	720	And so I wanted to make sure to share that there are many good developments, I think, happening through the Sunset Bill that is currently in the Senate and hopefully will go to the Governor's desk. And one of them is the fact that we are requiring the board to actually create a health and safety Advisory Committee, which will help the board promote safe standards for both industry workers and consumers.
150	Hadley	David	40	eYTxGLtgMco	2264	2278	The facts are that out of our approximately 1,000 school districts in the state, over 800 have asked for this flexibility, have asked for AB-1048 to be passed, have asked for this cap to be removed, so that they can manage their school districts.
151	Levine	Marc	8	JxGEdNdnkQ4	188	202	AB 653 would facilitate the ongoing collaboration between the University of California, the California State University, and the California Community Colleges, by making it clear that the community colleges are able to participate in shared contracts with the other segments.
152	Stone	Jeff	26	Ga_QNYq_wVM	1856	1873	And looking at statistics, child sexual abuse involving sexual contact between an adult and a child has been reported by 20% of the adult women and 5 to 10% of men in a number of studies. These studies suggest a huge disconnect between the number of offenses and the number of known offenders.
153	Mitchell	Holly	64	GQ9li0L2Ssk	748	769	The families can continue aid indefinitely, that poor families don't wanna join the workforce and therefore, have more babies so they don't have to and that it's the state's place to determine the number of children a family can be allowed to have. I would argue, members, that these assumptions could not be further from the truth and quite frankly I'm ashamed that we have enshrined in law statutes that perpetrate these horrible myths.
154	De Leon	Kevin	102	dPeGakg4w7Y	204	222	Allowing Elliot County to explore this option, will allow the region to determine its own future. With that, mister chair, mister vice-chair, and colleagues, with me to testify in support is Michael Turner of Los Angeles Metro. I respectfully ask for my colleagues' aye vote. Thank you, mister chair.
155	Mitchell	Holly	64	GQ9li0L2Ssk	701	717	I appreciate that Senator. First of all, I'd like to thank all those, who have tracked this issue are here today to support the bill. I like to thank the representatives from local government. I think that speaks volumes to the practicality in terms of even the court administration of the Mayors.
156	Pavley	Fran	104	CoCqxpnnd8w	1673	1700	We had an amendment worked out with the author striking all reference to prop one or what funding it's going to appropriations subject to finding available funding for these two conveyance projects. All right?Any other-  it's been moved by Senator Wolk. Any questions from the gentleman from Patterson because you came here?
157	Hertzberg	Robert	99	miQ0Fm1d12I	2131	2139	 Can I interrupt you for a second? I think we got a quorum don't we? Yeah, can I interrupt just, one, one second, sir. One second. I want to establish a quorum. Secretary call the roll.
158	Hertzberg	Robert	99	yhx1NvxzAgA	2067	2072	I don't know what my conclusion is, but I wanted to kind of probe those issues, so thank you Madam Chair for letting me have so much time on this.
159	Wagner	Donald	88	9mjyTPfbhPw	37	61	will, if they've been fortunate enough so far not to, has had some experience with this. The question we face is, do we take this hard first step? I don't often quote Scripture on this floor, in fact I may never have, and I'll keep that record alive, I'll paraphrase Deuteronomy.
160	Bonta	Rob	85	51wXJ30ZLf4	1888	1907	Each of which has expertise in various industries that have similarities to that of medical cannabis. The licensing requirements also ensure that the applicant has been approved by the local authority. To conduct business within the local ordinance related to commercial cannabis activity, our so called dual licensing structure.
161	De Leon	Kevin	102	GC6hApRO4Yg	1012	1031	I am proud to say that we have worked with both the sponsors as well as the California Chamber of Commerce to hammer out this compromise. There is no opposition to the bill. I want to give a special recognition to the very strong supporters, the working men and women who have had their wages stolen, who came up here lost many days of wages to come up here to advocate for the rights.
162	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	gZ0_qo7XpYk	440	454	In the governor's joint inaugural and the State of the State Address, in fact, even today, he announced an articulated vision for California to reduce the excessive release of carbon dioxide and other pollutants into the atmosphere by 2030.
163	Gatto	Mike	46	xhI7BgS1JK0	919	929	Because during housing booms like we're in right now, and certainly during the last one, there was, there were estimates that as high as 10% of people were buying properties to flip.
164	McCarty	Kevin	22	3kFvJ6RqeLE	99	119	As we know, access to the world's greatest public University system is one of the cornerstones of California's public policy as it relates to access to higher education. UC has provided access to higher ed for decades to Californians in hopes of bettering their lives and contributing to our state's economy.
165	Bigelow	Frank	91	3sW5Hb3fbq4	1816	1835	But ultimately, you can reasonably forecast today based on what your projections of cadet growth is and what your losses are going to be through attrition or whatever. You know what that defined number is? You should be able to tell us already.
166	Gatto	Mike	46	xhI7BgS1JK0	929	943	There were some that were buying properties in a fraudulent manner and, you know, just walking away from the mortgage. And of course, that would affect how a property is maintained, from an insurance standpoint.
167	Bates	Pat	58	CKAXbjP6mGQ	1731	1742	Until we have more bi-partisan dialogue on the critical issues and commit to retaining the authority given to us by the electorate I urge a no vote on SB 350?
168	Thurmond	Tony	4	uCE_G6_xZh8	998	1015	I think the record reflected that, although I was excited by your advocacy for making sure that state government is not charged the highest rate to support those we serve in the public. Mr. Chiu did you have anything else?
169	Leno	Mark	60	l9ONzDCnLn4	1152	1168	I know that the speaker and the pro tem are in deep discussions on this right now. So happy to take any comments folks have, but since we're not gonna decide this here today and this is being addressed, we've probably saved just a little bit of time by moving on, but go right ahead.
170	Hill	Jerry	66	jSkO5GUtg1k	65	94	So there've been a number of causs. Have we looked at the root cause to try and see what allowed this to evolve into the place it is today so that we make sure that even with your continued oversight, which I'm really pleased with, that we don't get into that position again, because you're not going to be around forever, we're not going to be there, but what can we see that from the history of this, that we can make sure that it doesn't happen again?
171	Block	Marty	59	ckveUQ3Zvdc	77	89	SB 620 would make it easier for applicants to track and obtain their requirements. It would also make it more straightforward for board evaluators to analyze an applicant's progress towards completion of these requirements.
172	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	b7XHatlYhkw	1902	1918	I mean, let's try to keep this an open and honest discussion. Where if someone is blowing the whistle appropriately, that they do so and that they're encouraged to do so, but they do so within a reasonable timeframe. So yes, Senator Leno.
173	Gaines	Ted	24	SK-C_51Liio	512	527	If I could just clarify the difference between our districts. Because I think you have about 50 square miles and I've got 27,000. So I know our districts are very different. But I would love to learn more about the housing issue.
174	Allen	Travis	43	PZ5qNcZ4hzo	1047	1061	The bottom line is this, recounts only very rarely change election results, and when there is no financial incentive to end a recount when tax payers are footing the bill, we're going to get a lot more recounts with elections that are unlikely to change.
175	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	scqfU4UsUAo	1681	1700	All right we have a motion by Senator Hertzberg. I am told that once we make the motion, identify it, we can't have any further discussion. I don't believe there is any opposition is there? There isn't. Okay motion which is do pass as amended to Senate appropriations please call the roll.
176	Bonilla	Susan	3	QOFO_OlHLpI	549	566	I just wanted to say I support your bill, put in the request to be a coauthor. I have to leave the hearing, but I just wanted to go on record of supporting the bill, will be voting for it in the future. Can't stay for the rest of the hearing today, but thank you for considering my request to be a coauthor on this bill.
177	Pan	Richard	96	vE1aI3Q_hng	265	280	This is in terms of compliance with federal law in order to be sure they get into school. And again, these are children where there is intention to get them vaccinated unless, of course, they have a medical condition on evaluation, in which case they would get a medical exemption.
178	Leno	Mark	60	13FyHcfWoOM	1678	1729	And we've seen in the private-sector, CEO's showing leadership and concurring with the CEO of Walmart's suggestion that this is an investment upon which they will get a return. Joining Walmart is McDonald's, Target, The Gap and others. And with regard to the automatic cost-of-living adjustment, this will give clarity and certainty to businesses, they will know exactly what to expect.
179	Chavez	Rocky	83	bencsnxh2-c	862	876	There's a problem there. If it takes that long to get out. That some of the older ones remember that we could get out in four years through college. And Mrs. Weber's laughing, she's with me at that age group. So, we, we're able to do that. So, there's a problem we have there.
180	Liu	Carol	63	J856PLRqmtw	1357	1380	Okay, thank you very much any other questions for Mr. Cabral? Thank you. We'll move on to Mr. Brooks Allen, the Deputy Policy Director and Assistant Legal Counsel for the State Board of Education. Welcome to the committing.
181	Weber	Shirley	44	Ks2cqtpLqGI	722	749	In the current year. Thank you very much. I wanted to ask a question with one of the comments made by finance. You listed a number of things in terms of addressing poverty and income inequality. I was trying to figure out how these two factored into our budget. One the increase of minimum wage and the extended sick leave, as budget items in terms of our expenditures of things that we're investing in.
182	Monning	Bill	25	Zk_K_zhn8-Q	315	338	But, with the big push to close the big centers and go to community-based support for the developmentally disabled; there's been no increase in the rates received by providers since 2006, yet we've had increase in minimum wage and other just cost inflators.
183	Pan	Richard	96	t4_AyYAahhk	770	781	I think we all know that. All of us who have been to higher education and it's not just what happens in the classroom, it's your also ability to interact with faculty outside the classroom when you have questions.
184	Pan	Richard	96	Ea-UVDMoM1k	1140	1170	point is that I hope that we are not constrained in our discussions about what we can do in the future, because we really first of all need to look at the needs. And we're not gonna say because we can only negotiate on a new deal on revising MCO or whatever and that brings in, who knows, let's say $500 million less money than we got in past years.
185	Chang	Ling Ling	18	hGRwdCC6_e8	389	403	AB 435 is an important bill that brings more transparency to two agencies that have some of the heaviest impacts on our state. This bill carries support from stakeholders across the spectrum and with that members I respectively ask for your aye vote.
186	Cannella	Anthony	61	bkbYI6-vC30	2005	2018	you know, because that's really what we paid more I was a $26 million contract now, right, $96 or $97 million dollars so I just think we've got to get better in the State of California when we're putting out computer program so that said, you know,
187	Wolk	Lois	94	C8rLBTiZ2A4	1792	1825	We will ask about the specifics in the Exide agreement, but let's start first with the general areas of legislative oversight that you've gone over.  And, I'm going to focus on the cost recovery issues and whether or not, you certainly highlighted and, this Committee has, the issue of backlogs and the issue of cost recovery.
188	Hertzberg	Robert	99	0yf1SfBcDOs	1676	1688	In the old days people used to always ask about the lottery. How come it doesn't pay for education? We thought the lottery was going to pay for education. That was my number one question today, is the high speed rail.
189	Wood	Jim	72	TZMmjuYAlwA	250	259	Just one briefly. First of all, thank you for your leadership for this, I'd be honored if you considered me as a potential co-author. I look forward to working with you on this important issue, for the citizens of California.
190	Beall	Jim	92	MOa6yahtOBc	591	614	I request an audit, there's gonna be an audit done by the State Auditor. If the Audit Committee, which I'm a member of approves it, then it will go subsequent to develop with my colleagues in human services here, some legislation to put the coordination back where it should be.
191	Cannella	Anthony	61	MN9yRILD2M0	485	496	I think that's a pretty neat opportunity to grow within state government, and I know we certainly appreciate people that spend their careers in state government and continue to grow. So congratulation to you for that.
192	Cooper	Jim	21	V2DWmVVPp4I	22	32	And I think more important we talk about a state-wide level, but the original, the first locally controlled high-tech crimes task was started here in Sacramento probably about seventeen or nineteen years ago.
193	Leno	Mark	60	_JbASqkciSI	787	800	Right. So, there are ways to do this in a very cost-effective manner and not unlike many of us sitting around here, we bring our own cups, reusable cups. We bring our own containers, reusable containers. Students can get in the habit of that as well.
194	Quirk	Bill	23	jKVkIx_af_k	34	50	AB 692 helps support this goal by encouraging development of very low carbon fuels, by requiring California to procure those fuels. So there are alternatives like this, they however are going to be required to be scaled up.
195	Wolk	Lois	94	cZhQQbz4zns	588	629	So this serves all of LA. So coming out to the west San Fernando Valley how everyone else seems to be, their perception is the long waits they have to go through is because of this. Is there anything I can tell them or tell my district staff? I mean I suppose I could get reservations but they feel that normal people usually go to the Grenada Hills office are being tremendously, in their perception, inconvenienced with extra-long waits that they normally didn't every have to go through.
196	De Leon	Kevin	102	mvgLH-ItAXY	1260	1269	You don't have to have the perfect answer, none of us have the perfect answers for a lot of gargantuan issues that we face every day. Right? We know we try every day, but give us a ballpark figure.
197	Maienschein	Brian	84	1ddkqgmLsnY	1848	1869	Mr. Gatto, quick question in support of the bill. By doing this, would this take the value of your home out, delete it for income tax purposes towards the total, you know, towards the total estate value?
198	Cooley	Ken	45	1kBpFTHnX5o	835	844	The convoluted nature of what was done in recent years in the law in this area led to some odd consequences, so I just think it's a good bill to bring forward.
199	Hill	Jerry	66	670ewxdSqNM	524	545	 In the lone discharge information that you're providing, that. Are you, and I noticed in the LAO's analysis on page six it talks about the, the economic loss and the, the, the included student's loan, cost of required equipment and materials, and interest on student loan debt used to pay those charges.
200	Stone	Jeff	26	oGlT-6EtEZU	1539	1548	This is a de minimis amount of money in comparison to what is spent on wood products in the State of California and the Consul General is doing her job in being here.
201	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	hYh0N-NJMx0	470	488	A couple questions. One is after you did your full scale exercise, did you notice any glaring? Problems that you're planning to address and would those require additional financial resources to do them?
202	Leno	Mark	60	6MVNU3iPWls	372	413	I don't know, I don't know if we have a motion yet, I'm happy to make it, but I, I think your use of our motto for other renewable is a wise one. And the whole philosophy 15 years ago when we started promoting solar, I was on the county board of supervisors, can you believe, 16, 17 years ago...the idea was to incentivize, so by we exponentially increase the demand and then have the cost fall equally, ever a greater parody, and that's your goal, that's what you set out to do, and it, we know it can work!
203	Leno	Mark	60	vEySB-JPx9Q	1040	1055	So, we're just again on the same premise, let the free-market work by allowing consumers to be able to make informed choices. This bill will require a label to again say that this product either does or does not have these chemicals in them.
204	Atkins	Toni	110	nhED5L0HREU	1248	1267	We will take a roll call vote on HR 1. Mr. Gordon is asking for an aye vote. Mr. Wilk is asking for no a vote. All those vote who desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote.
205	Beall	Jim	92	B0PWp2aeSfk	1341	1353	Okay, so I'm for holding their feet to the fire like the Madame Chair is doing. So go along with that but I have some things I would like to see in the trailer bill if I could have or take a leap.
206	Gaines	Ted	24	RfCRfIjvcog	1459	1467	That's great, when I was on the board of supervisors in Plasture, we'd always talk about what was happening in San Joaquin. And that was that's ten years ago.
207	Leno	Mark	60	vEySB-JPx9Q	1026	1040	The fact is that they still do because most of the products we're talking about here have a polyurethane foam in them and they buy it as a component part and there's still these chemicals being used sometimes.
208	Mullin	Kevin	31	EgZgFkyj3MQ	138	159	A quorum is present. A quorum is present. We ask our guests and visitors in the rear of the chamber and in the gallery to please stand for the prayer. Today's prayer will be offered by our Assembly chaplain, father Constantine Pappademos. Father Pappademos?
209	Hill	Jerry	66	Uhijp_1CdK4	908	920	And so we're getting into the fine tuning of this and the solution is there, and you certainly have my word, because this has been a long process and I wanna see it work for everyone. So we will have a solution. - Thank you.
210	Leyva	Connie	62	6UU1hF1F-fc	1429	1447	When I met with representative of Uber yesterday, by his own admission, there are over 100,000 cars from Uber and I think 40,000, he said, for Lyft, that are on the road, so I wouldn't categorize this bill, maybe, as environmentally friendly. I am going to support the bill today.
211	Nielsen	Jim	68	kjbtobUTSlE	1185	1210	Why would you want me to come I don't amount to anything anymore I'm long retired everybody has forgotten about me I said, Don I haven't forgotten about you please come Now I was a little bit gimpy then But, we got him around those wine caves and he had a grand time. And, a point I'd like to make on this respect
212	Cooper	Jim	21	CGzgwiFisVc	224	249	Right. Well I'm just saying, long before he came here. It's always been that way. You guys have not had enough officers. The AG, that's not my realm, but it's traditionally been that way. We're talking going back many, many years. Right now law enforcement is not a priority in some cases. Those are legitimate concerns with that.
213	Hertzberg	Robert	99	XAJHKAVYVrw	159	174	We estimated, we thought that would bring in, and so only to find out that the gentleman who has that dog by the name of Stutter down stairs is not in favor with that, so in advice of the state bar, we said what are the other alternatives.
214	Stone	Jeff	26	OHqd1YALBQA	1046	1067	To rise out of poverty. I believe that this is going to again make California so much different than our competitors throughout the country where we have paid sick leave impacts, we have higher taxes what Prop 30 that may or may not end in the very near future.
215	Maienschein	Brian	84	NYGfzZLGLck	64	73	Criminal street gangs have embraced pimping and human trafficing as a new revenue booster, as it now rivals narcotic sales as a major source of funding for many gangs.
216	Allen	Benjamin	70	scIQCOhjHBw	1076	1099	Okay. Great. Well, I really appreciate the panel. This is very interesting and important work, and I appreciate everyone's work on this as well. So thank you. Thank you so much. I think next that concludes the panels. And we'll now hear from public comment. Please, you can come up and take the four seats here, and we'll keep filling up the seats.
217	Mendoza	Tony	52	kGpKuwTOA0g	345	358	With me here today to testify is Mark Stanley, who is Executive Director of the Watershed Conservation Authority, and also Doug Houston, on behalf of the Watershed Conservative Authority, also available to answer any questions.
218	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	VyoFcVtTJtQ	785	804	But despite federal and state laws that require specific prevention education reporting in response activities, there is in existence a current provision in Title V of the California Education Code that community colleges believe prevents them.
219	De Leon	Kevin	102	fjQhThyumBs	686	699	Very good question Ms. Burke. A couple things. One is I do share your opinion with regards to CARB at times. I've had my own interactions, I think many of us have had our own interactions, and I think it's a important point to underscore.
220	Hall	Isadore	1	vwnSyW8C-l8	279	312	And I hope with that excitement and that vigor that my friends to the right when they proposed that resolution are present today and there's not a hint of hypocrisy or show in play in statements on this floor because California deserves better. California deserves more and, our most vulnerable population here in California deserve even the more.
221	Hertzberg	Robert	99	898OiW72jWg	469	478	My question is did you do an analysis of those projects to where you have private contractors involved and analyze what their cost overrun's were so you can compare apples to apples.
222	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	KLz991S1PxQ	594	617	And I think it's because of this word called affirmative action. JFK and Executive Order 10, 109, 25, and 61, he ordered the government contractors to take affirmative action to ensure applicants are employed and employees are treated fairly during employment without regard to their race, creed, color or natural origin.
223	Thurmond	Tony	4	A6ledtIW6-Y	255	272	Okay. Any questions from the committee? Seeing none, is there any public comment on the proposal from the Department of Rehabilitation? Well then, sir, you're off the hook. I mean, thank you for your presentation.
224	Stone	Jeff	26	kbDiQqGDHBM	1370	1380	That's going to provide for competition amongst drug companies, allowing them to compete and I think it's the best interests of our constituents. I urge an aye vote on AB 1124.
225	Perea	Henry	33	x_nA6Vz0FIc	1058	1075	to not only go through the process of FDA but to actually wait for the FDA? And I don't know how long it takes for the FDA to get back to them. But if the federal government is anything like the state government it takes a long time before these bureaucracies provide approvals for these types of products.
226	Allen	Benjamin	70	AGRN7-GFw2A	785	795	All it does is seek to give the Water Board regulatory authority over this. And ultimately people will come to the board and make their case, one way or another, as to the environmental impacts.
227	Quirk	Bill	23	zsDLiRLL6-I	70	94	Great. All right, Mr. Bibring, could you particularly address the comments here by Attorney Fishman and Ingemunson? As well as whatever specific items you came ahead here to talk to us about.
228	Stone	Mark	20	12FlSvu3zmM	830	854	And I think there's long been a disconnect in  So the place we need to look to first for implementation is really in those communities. And that's, your comments about distributing generation, about focusing on transportation and transportation fuels I think have much greater significance when we're looking at where we're implementing and some of the details in how we're implementing.
229	Nielsen	Jim	68	Ea-UVDMoM1k	312	331	Yes, briefly Mr. Chairman, I do want to thank you as well. You and I were communicating well into the night on many occasions, including last night about it. And I know that some of the delay with the Water bill particularly was well beyond your control. And I would have no complaints that we've had some opportunity to review a lot of these trailer bills.
230	Irwin	Jacqui	16	G0q0929_P6I	31	43	My goal for this Committee is simple to provide something tangible that can mobilize our resources and improve the state security This means moving on from strategies and recommendations to actions.
231	Wieckowski	Bob	55	jSkO5GUtg1k	1440	1463	And if you don't respond then the permit is granted, and I guess I have some concern about incomplete permitting, and the area of review documents and the these other documents that might be helpful for the agency to look at, so correcting me.
232	Baker	Catharine	74	VL9wjf3H8Kg	2276	2285	There's someone who may have at least on some terms be able to relate more closely. I didn't see that in the language and I'm curious if you can comment on that please.
233	Thurmond	Tony	4	89bDX7qtwgo	545	558	He's keeping track. Well done. Thank you Mr. Chair. Thank you Miss Kent, Miss Cantwell. This is a good continuation of the conversation we started in the Subcommittee. The conversation really impacted me.
234	Lopez	Patty	89	qW3ZYP7zbss	1518	1548	And I applaud you for your effort, and I look forward to put some legislation this year. And support you for in my part, I try to focus on prevention programs. And hold some public hearings in my district that will benefit a lot in my community. So thank you so much for sharing all your great experience and your testimony. That will benefit us, thank you so much.
235	Liu	Carol	63	t4hQNDqgAZU	744	768	Where are they, where's Michael, okay, and reconvene at 1:15 in Room 2040, 'cause the (inaudible) need to set up and hopefully you will all show up, members, so that we can proceed with the rest of the bills on our agenda, and for members and staff, there is a lunch out here in the hallway, thank you.
236	De Leon	Kevin	102	Mt9BcU600uM	16	35	Okay. I don't think this is going to be a very long meeting. We just have one appointee that's before this committee from the governor. We have established a quorum. Mr. Cannella, welcome. I want to welcome a member who was already a part of this distinguished Senate Rules Committee, Senator Mitchell. Welcome again.
237	Leno	Mark	60	bq30nlpq090	831	846	So that we're still in relative terms, historical terms,  in just from a revenue perspective still in a very modest position with the population that continues to grow, modest inflation.
238	Liu	Carol	63	w2OxGtfP7pQ	778	795	And, here to testify on my, the bills behalf, are Mary Gray, a successful participant in the ACP program,  and Diana Zuniga, a state-wide organizer for CURB, Californians United for a Responsible Budget. I respectfully ask for your support of the bill.
239	Williams	Das	12	t0t13B_zyEs	870	887	So, the Chair's recommendation is aye, with committee amendments.  It's do pass to Water Parks and Wildlife, would be the motion. Any other comments from the Committee? Would you like to close?
240	Bonta	Rob	85	CRMwg6_WO3E	1431	1440	I want to thank my colleague for raising that issue. It's on our radar, we're working on it. We think it's sensible in principle, but we know that there are some challenges with respect to application.
241	Garcia	Cristina	112	oyGJSKS61pM	94	110	This bill leaves flexibility for the school to find the solution that best meets the mothers' and schools' needs. This bill also helps remove barriers and give more choices for young moms to continue their education if they choose to breastfeed their infants. Pregnant and parenting students should not be forced to make decisions about
242	Alejo	Luis	9	y2dm_Q__xog	1978	2002	Well, it just, the best analogy, Mr. Chairman, is similar to a search warrant. If you were to go give notice to the criminal organization, before you could arrest somebody that law enforcement is going after, before he could get evidence that's critical in the case, it would all be gone. And that's similar here. You go to a neutral trier of fact, a judge, who you present the case, and
243	Rendon	Anthony	120	OGSzGIXfLs8	489	505	Even if they make it to the ballot in California and spend millions of dollars on a campaign for or against, an unconstitutional initiative will get struck down by the courts. Through all this process, the petitioners, signers, and voters may have very little information about whether the proposal is unconstitutional.
244	Patterson	Jim	119	4HBwd3okHJI	999	1011	in front of professionals who are just starting out in their careers. I have with me here Christina De Caro, who represents the California Veterinary Medical Association, in support.
245	Alejo	Luis	9	y2dm_Q__xog	2046	2066	and resulting in deaths of young people, like in Salinas where we had the highest youth murder rate. Three out of the last four years, this is where you're able to hurt them the most is by seizing their assets. But Mr. Chairman, we've put a lot of safeguards to make sure that this is used appropriately and as an effective tool for law enforcement, only at seizing these assets, be given notice.
246	Nielsen	Jim	68	MwU2rlmXSqg	437	455	I thank you. I'm gonna stop just for a moment, and ask the secretary to call the roll on the consent calendar. Senator Hueso has been very busy in committees all afternoon and if he needs to get back, I'd like him to be able to. So would you call the roll in the consent calendar please?
247	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	r81aKKdk2dA	1356	1369	Okay, all right. Thank you. Senator, I don't believe I can support it today and I'm sorry that we didn't talk earlier, but something doesn't sit right with where we are now with this bill for me.
248	Wieckowski	Bob	55	RdbGbgsSaLY	905	921	Let's turn to Item Number 15. Senator Pavley, you have a piece of legislation that would like to complete an inventory of greenhouse gas emissions from our state water system. This is an inventory bill.
249	Hancock	Loni	98	0XEmXVzSg6Q	1134	1153	They celebrate with the Vietnamese consul general on Vietnamese holidays. They travel back and forth and do business in Vietnam and in the United States. I've had the privilege of going with them to Vietnam and meeting their associates.
250	Monning	Bill	25	Y13vuRnCz5Y	925	939	But for purposes of a law that seeks to build in the safeguards that we've discussed and the protections against a family losing the benefits of a life insurance policy.
251	Hall	Isadore	1	J_Iq4rTF6rc	1221	1237	And so we have a bill before us that we have not, drilled down on and, in terms of the scope of work. But yet, we are attempting to redress, the compensatory component, not knowing the real scope of work on the commissions.
252	Pavley	Fran	104	8m8Es5iF3dE	1797	1828	That's part of the frustration here and that's why we're here. As a local government official it's very hard on you know, when you take your oath of office, public health and safety for your community to make informed decisions if people aren't forthright in providing information cuz you can dramatically change the character of a neighborhood without some very thoughtful input and collaboration with the local government.
253	Stone	Jeff	26	XCFU_0j8dAo	1049	1059	This is definitely thinking out of the box. It's using a renewable energy source to provide revenue, with the ultimate goal, and you have to show that that revenue is dedicated.
254	Gallagher	James	108	B4ry1_3tU0U	1538	1553	And we'll have this in our code. Whereas if we just had this broad language that says: look, any executive order that hasn't been implemented yet, we sort of already cover our bases, and don't have the specific references to executive orders, that may or may not exist in the future.
255	Chiu	David	7	7KrRcZ9ORsY	1924	1935	I appreciate again the difference that we have colleagues on this issue of choice. And I would just respectfully suggest that we may have a difference that may be difficult for us to resolve in this bill.
256	Leno	Mark	60	8ENPCPUYlKU	980	994	The bill is supported by unions as well as large employers like UPS and CalPers in its amended form. It has received bipartisan support and I ask for your concurrence on Assembly amendments.
257	Pan	Richard	96	2V6gzfYtqAs	416	432	And again, but not put any of the babies, any of the families at risk of information breaches or anything else, any other health issues. So I wanna be very careful about, cuz your going around telling people, well, if we're doing this we're gonna be doing experiments on your kid, that's frightening people.
258	Leno	Mark	60	h8juzK-Kjc4	462	481	I want to thank and credit Assemblyman Louie Alejo who led the charge in raising our minimum wage from eight dollars an hour to nine dollars last July, with a ten-dollar minimum wage coming in 2016.
259	Medina	Jose	81	pdgL4oOm7WE	503	541	Thank you. Speaking in opposition?  Before I hear from the opposition, I'm gonna call on others who want to come up to the microphone to speak in support. If you want to speak in support, just your name, what group you're with, and your support.
260	Allen	Benjamin	70	OaKXojP7k_0	1236	1257	of regulation, we need to address them in terms of legislation. I think the Senator, my friend has articulated a strong case for an important piece of legislation next year but I want to just remind folks about what we're talking about here which is just allowing people to get reimbursed for the use of the services for when they're doing government work.
261	Hill	Jerry	66	aimc434xzo4	107	120	If I could, Mr. Chair, just briefly, because we seem to get around the main issue is the definitional one that seems to be raised. And certainly the definition of 2010, now we're hearing that that doesn't work, and want a different definition.
262	Pan	Richard	96	BmeSyindq90	577	588	So there's a tendency to look at things that are easier to measure because the amount of resources and so forth are there, are less, or that they're easier to explain.
263	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	icpOpHkAqBE	723	751	Thank you. Yeah, I have a painful question to ask, yes it's. Well, no, this is a real quandary for me, this whole area of physician's assistants and others, nurse practitioners. I totally understand the need for, we've got to do something to provide healthcare to the millions of people who are now qualified to get it. Of course, we care for them anyway, but it's usually in an emergency room setting which is a really dumb place unless you really need it.
264	Hancock	Loni	98	_3qtjRH3Z-4	1287	1307	Finally, this bill codifies existing practice about when a county should conduct a face-to-face interview rather than a telephone interview or an electronic interview. With us today is Andrew Cheney, Policy Director of the California Department Association of Food Banks.
265	Gordon	Richard	117	kAZMIWno7zI	1304	1328	We have a committee on the judiciary that would be very interested in joining us in a discussion of that topic. And so, I think that one of the dynamics that Californians can look for as this committee does its work, is that oftentimes the issue of our privacy and consumer protection links with some of the other elements of the way we look at legislation.
266	Mitchell	Holly	64	dCf0VaDDxwk	790	815	Thank you sir, very briefly I want to thank you for the opportunity to serve on the committee today. And just say that I look forward to a robust, reality based conversation about critical issues that you've raised. The whole notion that a doctors visit in the real world would cost $8 is absurd and I think we have a responsibility to have a reality based conversation.
267	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	EupEjx01Yv8	938	956	So good afternoon Madam Chair and members of the committee I am pleased to present AB 575 on behalf of myself and the speaker and I accept the proposed committee amendments. This measure requires school districts and charter schools to implement a best practices teacher and an administrator evaluation system.
268	Harper	Matthew	14	oE98JCD72Xk	236	259	forcing people over to electric vehicles outside of a normal consumer choice situation, and also the question of mobility monitoring, which of course contains a lot of privacy questions. But for these reasons and others I'm very concerned. But overall one of the questions that I do have that's most fundamental, is the moving goal post.
269	Pan	Richard	96	2aV-8k1n6pw	392	413	Yet nothing's being done, at least there's nothing overt. And when I ask the question, how many plans have actually had consequences from not being able, the answer's I don't know. It should be at the top of your mind, how many times do we, so and I hope you'll come back to that information.
270	Allen	Benjamin	70	M81Gfx62IKE	316	352	Thank you Council Member. Just on your last point about online voting, I think if we do so much online now, I guess the question that keeps coming up is if... Forget about Sony and Anthem and Target. If the Pentagon can be hacked... what confidence do we have that a system of the complexity, the multijurisdictional nature, and high stakes of an election... will have the security guarantees that we need to make sure that North Korea isn't manipulating our
271	Cooper	Jim	21	qhIgiujuUww	1210	1225	Thank you. Any further questions? First of all I wanna thank the panelists for coming out and sharing their knowledge with us today. And also my committee members for being here for this committee. Hopefully we've all learned something we can take away today. I know I've learned quite a bit today in listening to some of the speakers.
272	Thurmond	Tony	4	uggbUvzVWb8	904	919	the schools that they can use to support many of the programs that have been heard before you today. I'm honored that we have two great witnesses who wanna share their testimony from the attorney general's office who's written on this issue and has continued to make this a very important issue,
273	Salas	Rudy	34	8ZmrJUXXU4k	1066	1077	Okay, additional comments, questions from members from the dais? Hearing and seeing none, let me offer some comments of my own, and Senator, I'll allow you to close afterwards.
274	Leno	Mark	60	LFikd5rYakY	343	376	Thank you, Madam President. There's not much more to say after hearing Senator Nguyen, who has the authoritarian voice on this issue, of course for her own and her family story. But, I do want to rise in support of the resolution to thank Senator Lara for his initiative and on behalf of the Jewish Caucus, share that the memory of ships of European Jews being refused
275	Bates	Pat	58	XSL2yLxKUCc	1261	1284	...the authority must within two years of such destruction, removal, rehabilitation, develop or construct, or cause to be rehabilitated, developed or constructed for rental or sale to persons and families of low or moderate income, an equal number of replacement dwelling units at affordable housing costs as defined by state law within the jurisdiction of the authorities.
276	Wood	Jim	72	jKVkIx_af_k	1770	1781	That's often part of a regulatory program. I'm a dentist by training, I have a license to practice dentistry, and a part of my license fee actually goes to enforcing against people who are not practicing appropriately.
277	McCarty	Kevin	22	GE9yKeDoFKQ	1901	1916	I get you're talking about districts with low income communities, high violence, high English language learner communities and those are a big part of my district, and so many of us up here. So that's an issue that we need to figure out down the road, so.
278	Mitchell	Holly	64	9eBx3f-E0dc	780	792	I think we'll wait and have our questions at the end of everybody's presentations because I will come back to you and ask you the million dollar question: price tag and where do we get it from? So begin to kind of think about that.
279	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	L_nqL1xdfS8	593	612	Well, I don't mean to point out pharmacist, I just, you know, we make certain assumptions that these things are helpful and productive and, I'm just, perhaps it might be a good idea to, at some point gauge whether or not they are being successful, or their level of success, there might be things we can do to improve upon them or not.
280	Cannella	Anthony	61	aimc434xzo4	249	264	After review, it has been noted that our state guidelines on billing are not significantly different from what other states require. Counties have added additional documentation requirements based on fears that the state might disallow some services because of the interpretations of the guideline and audits.
281	Gomez	Jimmy	80	xuTeMXcZRA0	397	421	When you're talking about the stage one or the stage dollars that you're talking about, those go from the Department of Social Services, not the Education Department. This is completely two different departments. Right? And two different departments, you're probably asking why they don't have the same technology, currently they don't.
282	Waldron	Marie	29	0pvN33z5LJg	1193	1209	And the physician must meet all requirements, professional knowledge, and the FDA compedia in the request. The Prescriber Prevails Act does not circumvent prior authorization process. The managed pair, care plan can say no.
283	McGuire	Mike	93	519YUTER2IM	1452	1466	And I'm not going to put words into the Senators mouth because I know that she'll comment on it, but believe that the Senator will be bringing forward potential language that would say that it would not impact, this legislation would not impact, the Lodi Center until a certificate of renewal?
284	Baker	Catharine	74	qCEr8jDp5Hg	986	998	These accounts are a community fund for a child's education. So families can't, aren't the only ones who can contribute. You can have aunts, uncles, and others contribute to the account as long as they meet the income levels.
285	Leyva	Connie	62	hp2WTRF5hkg	256	275	I, no, I really don't want to sing, nor does anyone want to hear me sing. I think we're in a very unique position here in California. I think that the landscape is changing and I think we have an opportunity as one of the previous speakers said, is to make California the state it once was in manufacturing. I think that's absolutely accurate.
286	Gomez	Jimmy	80	JgpqDSrKaXw	1415	1438	AB 254, Hernandez, conform local elections dates to statewide election dates, do pass with amendments. Still leading charter cities from the bill's requirements. B roll call. AB 255, Irwin, Office of Internal Audits for Veterans Affairs. Holding committee. AB 259, Dababneh, Public Agency Data Breach Mitigation, do pass. A roll call.
287	Rodriguez	Freddie	69	j_cwUXYUJzk	207	223	The FCC and the nation's four largest wireless cellphone carriers are trying to address the location issue. In January of this year, the FCC Federal Rule was issued that requires carriers to steadily increase the percentage of cellphone calls to 911 that transmit location data.
288	Lara	Ricardo	107	ptq5V1Fu0ok	434	456	First beginning, this begins our first item with the Assembly measures beginning with Assemblymember Achadjian. AB 631. I'm sorry, 361. I'm dyslexic. 361, the motion is do pass to the Senate Floor. Secretary, please call the roll.
289	Hancock	Loni	98	dv1TuQD9iKk	1351	1381	Thank you. Thank you very much. We will now have time for public comment. Because of the fact that we've actually taken all the time for the hearing, listening to our panelists, which was very important because we need forward direction. We'll have one minute per speaker.
290	Garcia	Cristina	112	Y0xkoNoudD0	525	536	It is often said that are budget is a value-based document. Well, what does it say when the State of California fails to fund the Commission on the status of women and girls? How much value does that demonstrate?
291	Anderson	Joel	57	PFemgtd0i88	764	789	When I went through this bill, I looked at it. I know that in my communities I represent we have an issue with this. We've had some horrible outcomes because people weren't clearly identified with having issues, weren't responsive in the way that the officer was anticipating. It resulted in a problem.
292	Nielsen	Jim	68	WfZQBhRsFGQ	124	146	We talked a lot about it last week. Today, we're gonna focus on some of the hope for our veterans. The traumas of war we talked last week about post-traumatic stress syndrome didn't even have a name for many of the generations of the military that have served our country so nobly.
293	Alejo	Luis	9	XSL2yLxKUCc	632	645	I have before you AB 2, which will allow certain blighted areas of California to create a new entity called a Community Revitalisation Investment Authority or a CRIA, to work toward tackling issues facing our state most disadvantaged communities.
294	Nielsen	Jim	68	WfZQBhRsFGQ	148	174	And now we have some opportunities through the Veterans Treatment Courts to do something constructive and positive. They're relatively new, but we already have some successes. It's no small measure by virtue of the mentoring about the veterans, who are helping their peers with the challenges that they face.
295	Hill	Jerry	66	4tVR58n3Ljg	916	963	Absolutely. And I just had my teeth whitened before they got here so I feel much better about that so we can shine up here. So it's a review of the Dental Board of California. Welcome and thanks for your patience today. And we have a few issues to go through and Fran if we could... Alright, please begin.
296	Hernandez	Ed	103	zrGTvYeF0_s	22	50	Today we plan to discuss, in more detail, potential MCO tax structures. As we all know the MCO tax is the primary funding mechanism identified by the Governor as a funding solution to fill gaps in funding for critical public program services. Our current tax is due to sunset in July of 2016 and is not likely to be reauthorized by the federal government in its current form.
297	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	Wt_ez7F9UlE	2	26	Abbreviated agenda today. We have the following items that have been pulled from the agenda.  Item 3, AB 355 by Assemblymember Garcia is pulled. Item 16, AJR 9 by Assemblymember Chang has been pulled. So if you are here for either of those items, unless you just want to enjoy our company, no reason to stick around. Those have been pulled.
298	Mendoza	Tony	52	XCc8jyb6PaM	1949	1957	Some of the kids might have medical conditions that prevents them from getting any kind of a vaccine, so that means that the people around them need to be protected.
299	Chau	Ed	116	0hkCdiDRiI0	565	588	AB 41 prohibits a health care provider or service provider or contract or insurance company policy issued on or after January 1st, 2014 from discriminating against any health care provider who is acting within the scope of that providers license. Today I have a sponsor from the California Chiropractic Association here to testify in support of the bill.
300	Allen	Benjamin	70	ZhE_hzRecAQ	1630	1657	I think ultimately, our democracy depends on the true participation of our populous. It's at the heart of who we are as a nation and the more we can get more people to participate and feel ownership and engage, the more our system will truly be responsive to our citizens and to our public and the more vital and vibrant our civic life in our democracy will be.
301	Pavley	Fran	104	qTf-RqJKEFo	49	59	We don't allow that but after the as soon as we hear from to see if anyone here is opposed, they may not be listed but then I'll turn to you for the motion.
302	Weber	Shirley	44	CEtC6uXpjsc	42	63	In other words, whether having them in our University of California really is a farm team for higher ed, basically, and for research in the future. So, that would be important to know what success they bring to the discipline itself, to higher education in terms of those who attend. I think it would be important to know whether or not we're doing this simply to get the money.
303	Weber	Shirley	44	ELlYlrBZUfQ	960	972	But most importantly, unless we're willing to spend $1.5 billion on this prison, which I don't think any of us are willing to do at this point. You are? No, you want to talk. Okay, I was gonna say.
304	McGuire	Mike	93	GUxOzh3Wh0Q	2079	2091	Number two, I do believe that these biomass plants would provide a cleaner form of energy, particularly on peak period, during peak periods and the hottest days in the state.
305	Roth	Richard	106	YmgQ9S1o328	1060	1077	I mean it's a non-economic issue in the county. I think we're relying on the county to assess who owes who what, and then certify to you that whatever debt that's been owed is taken care of in order to allow the mechanism, to take place, right?
306	Nielsen	Jim	68	kjbtobUTSlE	1106	1125	a very democratic area. Now it got even more democratic and I know it because I represented the same area, but Don tended the folks back home so very well that he was elected again and again. And, he did deliver the projects that
307	Hueso	Ben	48	j_YjnTPR-gU	2031	2046	Mr. Ting just generally if we can reply to the senator we have the proposal for 2017 effective date maybe or a 2018, I'm sorry. Do we need an effective date?
308	Pavley	Fran	104	cRT-vVNBfAE	846	865	People been fired over the periods of time. Recently, Mark Nechodom resigned as Department of Conservation. They are getting ready to hire a new person. We have problems, and I am concerned about protecting our water supply. So, what we're left with here is a reporting period, additional PYs.
309	Mitchell	Holly	64	gWhhKfvsU08	596	621	And to suggest that the average $200 annual refund would in any way be relevant to a family who needs ongoing childcare is offensive at best. I think even with our low reimbursement rate in childcare, that would buy you about a week, out of 52. Thank you, sir.
310	Dahle	Brian	47	6eiRJcn_uL0	1327	1342	Is it the culture? There's gotta be something that I'm missing here and I know that, I've picked on a little bit I've read the article that the New York Times article and I know there's eh that, that they're working their way into the job on some of these cases but it,
311	Lackey	Tom	10	i1dEPEL80sQ	425	437	No questions but just a quick comment. I do appreciate how Kodak is working toward being both environmentally friendly as well as efficient. So I'd like to request to be a co-authors as well.
312	Garcia	Cristina	112	ejG5Ru6MX_o	382	395	Since then, our state and our nation have engaged politically with our neighbor to the south. Last summer when President Pea Nieto addressed the California Legislature, he spoke of the reforms implemented during the first months of his presidency.
313	Lara	Ricardo	107	-absEc_YvaI	504	518	Thank you. Let me put my effort in to try to back the TBL, the Trailer Bill Language. You know, the LAO was absolutely right, in the caseload for some counties over 300, way above the Judicial Council standards.
314	Pavley	Fran	104	yzBzen_uFsA	997	1037	First it was the venture capitalists, now its on-the-ground businesses that are energy efficiency, and everyone's districts around the state. There's an amazing amount of supporters, so this is certainly stopped that debate between, there's a choice between a health environment and strong economy, no you can't have both, and despite the recession, California, this was one of the good news spots during the recession, we continued to move forward because of the market signals in a clean energy economy, and now all these people are excited and interested in moving forward even more, so it's, it's not just an environmental bill anymore.
315	Gray	Adam	27	FVQ4YG_BqFE	320	342	Given the pending special session on health care and some of the other timing issues, we're gonna go ahead and hold the bill here in committee but continue to work with the Senator on that subject area. In the hopes that sometimes this session we can move something forward in respect to that policy. Thank you Senator and go ahead and present on your other item.
316	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	-R4HGT4UbOs	1372	1386	Rick developed a constituency. A following that was broad, diverse, and always felt included because he was not afraid to address concerns that had universal appeal and didn't put others down.
317	Bonilla	Susan	3	99NWh04_JOI	2328	2347	Well, I do just thank you very much for your questions, and it is a complex issue. It's certainly our hope to have a resolution as soon as we possibly can, and I think that already 684 has shown that it's been a prod in that direction.
318	Monning	Bill	25	zEbSrzyLdms	633	641	As your research revealed, or do you have access to data of the rate of the closure of provider homes that's been happening over the last couple of years?
319	Levine	Marc	8	0LdXFnPqPCk	837	855	We must never forget what occurred on Bloody Sunday. Toward that end this past week, we witnessed the coming together of diverse people of a diverse nation to remember that historic moment. Sadly, last week we also witnessed a disturbing demonstration of racism at the University of Oklahoma.
320	Bonilla	Susan	3	XrOqCob7jCo	492	507	The measure is 8-0. The measure is out and then we have consent. If I could get a motion on file item 15 and 16, SB 799, SB 800, consent calendar. Thank you.
321	Hancock	Loni	98	slpYLwAvmtM	1376	1392	Right, right and so, you would be able to call out that information and make a report to the legislature? I think we'd be very interested in that. Particularly, quite frankly, around variation between counties.
322	Pavley	Fran	104	Q1ptrvjk-As	1075	1089	So, as the bill moves through, and we get a better sense of where the administration's headed and a conversation with Superintendent Torlakson, I think we can work something out.
323	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	-8HmkVu5hs8	1123	1137	everyone's had a chance but now it's time for us to ask the questions and to have that discussion so let me start over here because we didn't hear much from you earlier and then to the other physician who is here in response.
324	Nielsen	Jim	68	TSSAjU2zD6s	1555	1575	And that's all we want to do. But many might want to do more within that career. Advance themselves in some way, or the moving off into some new directions. Are there some mechanisms, here in, to enhance that opportunity for the upward bound, if you will, career tech student?
325	Mathis	Devon	75	NNzDQCiG5UU	1689	1713	Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It is with a heavy heart that I rise and ask that we adjourn in the memory today of one of my constituents and a longtime resident of Big Pine California, Ms. Chloe Ava Miles. Chloe passed away peacefully at our home with her family by her side on January 20th 2015, at the remarkable age of 104.
326	Hernandez	Roger	37	kGJrWtDlyMM	1271	1285	With me here to speak in support of AB 248 is Ms. Beth Capell on behalf of Health Access California and Ms. Sarah Flocks on behalf of the California Labor Federation. So, at this time I'd like to ask Ms. Capell to please speak.
327	Monning	Bill	25	9Ksuo-8qRMo	833	858	That said, I think we should fully explore ways that where equipment is deployed, that there's training where possible, voluntary refresher with employees or staff, I think we could look into ways to incentivize raising the caliber of people that might be in a workplace, but it will save lives, and I will be supporting the bill.
328	McGuire	Mike	93	GHyOxyKfubI	1440	1465	And these groups are eager to comply with Standards that all other ag producers are expected to follow if we actually gave it to them. We had a series of meetings and tours just this last weekend with a couple of senators from southern California who met with law enforcement, fish and wildlife officers and growers, and they were blown away by the scale and complexity of the marijuana industry.
329	Quirk	Bill	23	pqf8UezhQwo	238	255	AB33 would require the council to complete its work on a timeframe established in consultation with Carb after allowing for public comment. So the council's efforts may be offered as recommendations for inclusion in Carb's next scoping plan update.
330	Thurmond	Tony	4	DqvTWVgFqyQ	1060	1073	Thank you Dr. Flores and thank you Director Kent, all of two weeks and, as a new member I know exactly how you feel. We just scheduled this hearing just for you, so that you could have a chance to share your ideas.
331	Hernandez	Ed	103	JtKXoGz7JFs	344	364	Opponents will likely offer anecdotes and personal stories to make their point about safety. However if this policy puts patients in harm, we would see much more evidence in other states, but there's no evidence of that. They don't have any data to back up that particular argument.
332	Gomez	Jimmy	80	qbDN-8u61LI	1667	1684	Senator, thank you for bringing this bill forward. And I understand why it's such a local issue for you. The area you represent is very intertwined with the industry.
333	Bonta	Rob	85	q7LT4HnI37Y	674	692	That's been explained in the ramp-up, that's necessary. But my understanding, please correct me if I'm wrong, is that that's how long it takes to complete the current pending investigation workload while also keeping up with the new workload. So when you say the latter, when you say the new workload, my understanding,
334	Garcia	Eduardo	38	xnlrOV-AGaQ	369	389	The next panel, we have two presenters. We have Kim Delfino, California Program Director for Defenders of WIldlife, and Juan Altamirano, Associate Director of Public Policy for the Audubon California. Welcome.
335	Stone	Jeff	26	V0u3hJx63PI	225	235	What is the process to negate the requirement for ATAR? I think it's such a beneficial drug that can help so many people. Why even have the obstacle put in front of them like that?
336	Hernandez	Roger	37	I1DeZTgw_DI	583	595	Hearing and seeing none, at this time I'd like to call up the opposition. Please come forward. And just as a reminder, three speakers, two minutes and then every subsequent speaker beyond will be simply an add on.
337	Levine	Marc	8	2w72Z1tf27E	481	510	Long agenda today or not so much? All right you guys. All right, thank you very much Senator. We have a very special bill that I've been working on with some students from Manor Elementary in Fairfax. We started talking with them about the drought and they came up with some ideas on how we can do a whole lot more for our state and how to lead, please have a seat. And, I wanted to give them an opportunity to share that with you.
338	Block	Marty	59	plFZ8bCzfMQ	634	645	Thank you. We want to thank all the speakers of-- is there another speaker? Are you coming forward to comment? No, OK. Thank you all for your comments I now turn the gavel back over to Senator Mitchell.
339	Nielsen	Jim	68	D5Q9kXxepgM	1399	1417	And give us information that can be helpful to many others of you, from the standpoint of the state Legislature. Okay? Obviously your mentor will help you. You will be mentoring others. But I want to thank you very much for being with us here today. Thank you. Sir.
340	Lara	Ricardo	107	LD6QgC66xr0	1443	1458	Okay. As we discuss this, I think this would merit more policy discussion. If we're going to be creating a new program, I think the legislature should have an opportunity to weigh in. The efficacy of these programs are being proposed.
341	Holden	Chris	78	b7XHatlYhkw	1123	1137	I'm sure they go through some type of review. But it's clear that they're not as concerned. Their standards may not be necessarily as high. And they probably even do it, recognizing in some cases,
342	Williams	Das	12	JT1Tm7zEIWc	1482	1504	There is some of that concern. We have given language back to the consumer attorneys that reads something similar, but is a little more consistent with the Senate Labor Committee analysis that we thought was excellent. It would read between lines 5 and 6, on page 10.
343	Gomez	Jimmy	80	qrLFVDrXadw	349	381	And how to implement their master plan for the LA river. There's some components where there's just, the river ends, right? We can't continue a bike path, we can't continue greening. But in the end, it's going to be up to the local municipality to use their judgement on how much, how this tool is used and any city and any elected official at any capacity understands that any abuse of a tool like this could cause backlash.
344	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	0HDXR-Yl1D8	968	1041	Alright, this is the time scheduled for a special setting of SB 251 by Senator Roth. I will take a five minute break while we get ready for this particular item. So we'll be back in five minutes. Alright, we are back in session. Thank you all for your indulgence. This is the time certain for in the special order for SB 251.
345	De Leon	Kevin	102	BHYxE3t9U1s	1491	1512	So, is not a clear demarcation line then, it's not black-and-white? Because on one end I'm hearing the adjudication side, the prosecution side, we have a hybrid system that exists currently right now. That it's an anomaly and this agency in particular, I am not familiar with the federal agency, how the national, you know, ALRB, you know, is constituted.
346	Mathis	Devon	75	3Luw7tOrBzg	1222	1242	you know, Assemblyman Frazier's comment, you know, they're paying to make sure that they're accredited. And there's just tons and tons of problems there that need to be addressed and need to be taken care of to ensure that.
347	Wieckowski	Bob	55	vpNS8YXwTNY	505	536	As tempting as it may be to amend bills on the fly given the Governor's press release down in Los Angeles, as the Chair I'm not going to allow that. I have a bill on climate adaptation and a portion of the attention from this mornings press release was done on climate adaptation. We're going to deal with the bill with all its inadequacies as today, but suggestions that they have more detail is certainly welcome by this Chair. Next in opposition.
348	McCarty	Kevin	22	RfCRfIjvcog	1997	2016	Thank you, Mr Chair. I'm here to present to you AB 422, on behalf of the Sacramento Regional Transit District which is a very unique RT district, created in the state PUC code. Very different than many other districts throughout California, in your neighborhoods, which is why I'm here today.
349	Block	Marty	59	DcIk90J9Qng	1360	1370	Now, if enrollment grows at the community colleges but not at CSU and UC, does that create a problem for where the students go once they finish their two years?
350	Leno	Mark	60	1pqxt5c6yPs	15	39	Thank you, Mr. Chair, and committee members. This bill deals with equal benefits in state contracting for transgender employees, and what it really does is it merely leverages the state's power, its market power, in public contracting. We already have laws on our books that prohibit any discrimination based on gender identity, in the way we do our business here.
351	Hertzberg	Robert	99	1l8Sm-QNSvU	1823	1835	So there is no dollar amount. It really does go to the issue that you're concerned about. It does involve the discussions we have. Really respect that larger issue because it doesn't fund any money. It just sets the framework so a governor can fund it if they so choose.
352	Leno	Mark	60	lS3XfLDqvqY	612	628	Senator if I may just close to remind the committee that for over 30 years, the very products we're talking about here, these specific 21 products, juvenile products, were required to have a label that they complied with our fire safety standard.
353	Leno	Mark	60	SdYdT8y72Ng	416	431	And she would point out, if she were here, that's the time of day that these kids get into trouble with the law and get pregnant and complicate their lives unfortunately and unnecessarily.
354	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	nkFf3IHgULc	1973	1989	Because to walk away form something cuz you don't want to hear what the person is saying for example, if you just stood still, you would know what it is. And by walking away, you really should have known what was being said. And you can say look, I didn't hear it, I wasn't there.
355	Weber	Shirley	44	HpHzTWJvRTs	1272	1286	And so this would get us to that level. So that it kind of gets out of the political arena a little bit rather than everybody wants it in their neighborhood, start talking about where do we need to put it. If we were to do any additional CSU's and now we ask for the UC as well.
356	Bloom	Richard	2	9fvwP7KwrvY	225	243	Overall I think my head is in more or less the same place that Mr. Mullen's is. I guess I am officially on the fence right now about what to do about this and I wish there was some way to bring this all altogether. Sometimes that's not possible.
357	Cooley	Ken	45	cflx69hA7mw	809	825	And prior, ask that they prioritize those counties with demonstrated success in utilizing rapid re-housing principals. So that's 250,000 per pilot county. This is a idea that has been tried in other states.
358	Roth	Richard	106	E7fL6Rs-58o	118	131	Thank you, Madame President and colleagues. ADA access issues are a problem in this state, but so are ADA lawsuits. Particularly, when business owners are not provided with education and training. They are not provided with an opportunity to correct the problem.
359	Leyva	Connie	62	1JV-wI6cFUY	57	72	I have wondered many times myself, how many paychecks am I and my family away from being on the streets. We don't know.We don't know, and those of us who have a place to go to sleep each night are very lucky.
360	Patterson	Jim	119	WPjNTeG9jTo	495	524	And I can testify from personal experience that we are more cooperative, not less cooperative, with the FCC. We find ourselves in a circumstance when there is a notice of the potential over modulation or spurious signal or whatever the violation might be that we do have an opportunity to quickly fit it and not be penalized for an oversight.
361	Wolk	Lois	94	xG-KiREcweY	486	518	3-0. That is approved. To now approve the half million dollars from the TSCA account to do the protocol to do something about the disposal of materials more broadly as well as to deal with the local incentives to impose penalties so that we reduce the stock. Or we enable the shipment of fireworks, or the disposal of the fireworks. So with that, is there a motion?
362	Levine	Marc	8	kGJrWtDlyMM	201	219	Thank you, Mr. Chair. My next bill is AB 653. This would require the CSU, UC and community colleges to coordinate their efforts when investing in system wide technology to prioritize the student success across segments is the number one priority. According to the committee's analysis, any cost to this segment would be minor and absorbable.
363	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	g6zVy-O_oEg	176	219	I'm kind of curious, as this warning system is developed. I know I've worked with a lot of emergency management organization, police, fire and, they have their own internal incident command system, but even that may be dated. I don't know what its called now but that was in 94. It may be called something different now but, then they have to be activated. And so how were you envisioning this early warning system coordinating with police, fire, and others so that they can then become activated so that we're all moving and sinking as one to get things done.
364	Kim	Young	82	p3k9Axcv6TA	412	437	a handful are not, because they don't meet the district policy. Instead of appealing, many of these parents feel they must find an address south of Houston in order to keep their kids close to home. A local memorandum of understanding process has been stalled for years, if not decades, because of the staffing changes.
365	De Leon	Kevin	102	fjQhThyumBs	1195	1214	The republican leader of the Senate or I should say, excuse me, the soon to be republican leader, Ms. Fuller, no longer calls Kern County an oil county. She calls it an energy county, with respect to the diversity of the portfolio in Kern County.
366	Beall	Jim	92	898OiW72jWg	1985	1993	Okay do you just want to make a motion now? I move the bill. Okay you move the bill. Senator Allen please. There's a motion for the bill on the floor.
367	Allen	Benjamin	70	BcWeZKoBLoU	1229	1241	Okay. And some of the recent concerns about some of the gamesmanship that was going on with regards to school bonds in certain districts doesn't leave you concerned about raising those caps.
368	Williams	Das	12	wr_Nl1-RdXY	885	909	Have you done any legal analysis on this? Every bit of cap and trade funds are supposed to have a GHG reduction. Otherwise, it is not a fee but a tax. So what is the GHG reduction nexus with the, I'm not saying the study's not a good idea.
369	Mendoza	Tony	52	9wfdC9HGDSQ	2200	2226	Mr. President and members, SCR 3 is back for concurrence. SCR 3 proclaims January 26th as India Republic Day, adds amendments that were added in the Assembly. SCR 3 has not received any no votes. I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
370	Eggman	Susan Talamantes	73	Gnpfbx52n0w	1414	1431	I would just see that our intentions are the same that counties be able to-- that every county have the opportunity and everybody who lives in every county have the opportunity to be able to weigh in on what we think is an important issue without reducing voluntary services again with the new stream of funding available.
371	Stone	Jeff	26	rn8iMdWxrk0	482	496	Charities in our state do a great job at helping kids, veterans, and seniors, and this bill will help them in their mission to provide valuable community services. Thank you Mr President and again thank you to the Senator from Los Angeles for bringing this forward.
372	Hueso	Ben	48	ymi21hh5WVg	911	930	Thank you Madame Chair. I just also wanted to chime in, just some comments in support for the bill. I just want to thank the author for bringing it forward. It's very sad to read about the extinction of species every year. We hear of some species leaving the earth forever, never to come back.
373	Monning	Bill	25	r49jrzf4Gi8	102	126	And my constituents need to be assured that the reviews and oversight are in place, especially with mounting concerns about the plant's seismic vulnerability. Furthermore, the accident at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant in Japan had a devastating impact on the surrounding communities and it should remind us that keeping a watchful eye on the risk, while not easy, is absolutely necessary.
374	Hill	Jerry	66	ckveUQ3Zvdc	359	380	Some of you will recall that I introduced this bill in 2013. And after six committees and three floor of votes, it received near unanimous support with only four members opposing it. As the governor indicated then in his veto message, his only opposition was timing since there were no bisosimilars yet approved.
375	Gatto	Mike	46	MJ3yc4dhcxc	981	1003	HOV lanes on one stretch of the 210, 134 freeway in Southern California. I think it's a sensible way to use our lanes. I think we send a message to our constituents who have non-traditional commutes, who cannot carpool, that we're gonna put that lane back online during the time of the day where carpooling doesn't occur anyway.
376	Chang	Ling Ling	18	y2dm_Q__xog	958	984	Just a little over a week ago, my staff demonstrated this by live-streaming a meeting of the California Energy Commission. With the use of nothing more than their personal cellphone, a free app and an Internet connection. My staff met the standard proposed in this bill with again, merely a personal cell, a free app, and an Internet connection. Costs practically nothing or minor and absorbable.
377	Beall	Jim	92	cvDmVx__4xs	519	548	The other issue is the Board of Equalization is a separate governmental body, but the Department of Finance is subject to actions of, in a sense, the legislature, including this committee. So we could, if we wanted to question something, we could question it through the budget process or through this committee in some way if we felt the rate was not correctly set.
378	Weber	Shirley	44	nugSHhjUz14	59	93	Many of you have spent many, many hours attending the meetings as members of the larger community. But many of our Budget Committee members have also attended extensive meetings. I want to specifically thank the Chairs of the budget, Mr. Thurmond, McCarty, Bloom, Nazarian, and Jones-Sawyer, for their work in crafting this budget and what he have before us is a work of not only the Chairs, but the Sub-chairs of those committees, and the members of the committee process that's there.
379	Medina	Jose	81	7yVOTftNjfw	1179	1200	Is the discrepancy in funding that this audit brought out back in 2011. The discrepancy in funding in campuses. The per-student contribution by UC to those very campuses that I just mentioned. To those very campuses that have the highest minority enrollment and they are getting less funding per student than the other campuses.
380	McGuire	Mike	93	EhsW00cBA0A	321	333	And I know that all of you are well aware of the regulations, permits and certificates, and other processes that farmers and ranchers have to go through when growing crops such as nuts or grapes, or raising cattle and sheep.
381	Mitchell	Holly	64	ISFND_-5pCw	194	221	Is today the 19th? August 19th, that would be today. That's a problem for a very critical Commission, very critical appointees that make major decisions that impact, as Senator Cannella said, every aspect of every Californian's life. When, as I recall, they were noticed in the daily file, well before our summer recess began.
382	Stone	Jeff	26	WsNNww2cgqU	1388	1409	I applaud the author's intent with the legislation, but I feel like there's just too many loose ends that are gonna create frivolous lawsuits and provide yet another way for a defendant to file an appeal and have his or her conviction reversed. So unfortunately I won't be able to support the bill today.
383	Pan	Richard	96	n_QC4AsmdBs	363	376	and then just want to acknowledge that as well, and that their experience is going to be essential in transitioning their experience and their backgrounds to our new state workers is going to be essential, and we want to applaud the current state workers for their work as well.
384	Pan	Richard	96	XxAKuU0JQuk	82	97	CalPERS offers over a dozen traditional healthcare plan options. And so today, we'll be exploring the impact of adding high-deductible plans into this mix and how doing so would potentially impact the other plans in PEHMCA and the employees and retirees who receive healthcare under PEHMCA.
385	Wieckowski	Bob	55	EaHeR5UFXjc	1897	1912	We get a little confused with actual debt and the process serving. When you get that default judgment you have that original contract that you signed with Chase bank who evidently did some robo-signings and it got some judgments, and then,
386	Monning	Bill	25	YaTK7ym74zw	652	671	Over medicating foster youth is costly for the State of these medications. They cost a lot. Using other services like TBS, therapeutic behavioral services, or trauma focused therapy show better outcomes instead of using millions of dollars for dangerous cocktail medication being paid by Medi-Cal.
387	Grove	Shannon	77	rKOC2CSv6h0	782	805	We are I just really want a yes or a no. I'm asking you as a State Representative representing the 34th Assembly District, I'm asking my Department of Finance are you comfortable with sending out $184 million of taxpayer dollars without it going to competitive bid? I'm asking your wisdom and direction. And I'm just asking for a yes or no answer.
388	Alejo	Luis	9	P6cBeme--dw	515	539	And, last march. He sat down with all my brothers and sisters around him and he had that conversation that you never want to have with your loved one, but what happens when that time comes? What choices does he want? And, I hope that none of you have to ever have that conversation because you can't help but cry and it hurts profoundly.
389	Bloom	Richard	2	c9Ojvyv2LI0	362	380	However, we can and do lead by example and hope that our successes will be adopted or expanded upon by others. For those of you who are fans of Dr. Seuss,  particularly The Lorax, the Once-ler once said,
390	Alejo	Luis	9	P6cBeme--dw	501	515	This is the man who worked hard his whole life, made an honest living to take care of his family. The guy that when we were kids, we all looked up to, he was a strong guy in our family. But now here he is fighting for his own life.
391	Lara	Ricardo	107	AtJ4r5Cv5ko	1200	1210	Is that the same case for low income communities, people of color, immigrants-- I mean I'm not-- I don't know but it seems that they're much more prevalent in law income communities.
392	Leno	Mark	60	nrJtkVtsuec	499	511	But at the same time, what about potentially disadvantaged communities that may not playing in that ballpark of a $100,000,000 plus? Do you have any concern that there may be some unintended consequence here?
393	Grove	Shannon	77	rDGVmGQNitA	535	547	So break that down for me, because we're operating, I'm just trying to do the simple numbers and what we have in front of us. So if you had to increase it by $371 million, what is that do for your voucher rate from 710 to 1124?
394	Alejo	Luis	9	0LdXFnPqPCk	575	591	In 2013 the U.S. Supreme Court and Shelby County versus Holder shut down Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act which along with Section 5 required pre-clearance by the Department of Justice to any changes to local electoral systems with histories of discrimination.
395	Bloom	Richard	2	kQ8roglP29M	1423	1441	Thank you Mr. Chair and committee members. I'd like to begin by thanking committee consultants and all the stakeholders who participated in numerous discussions, and as a result, I have proposed authors amendments that will remove the local licensing and other data collection requirements that this bill had.
396	Hertzberg	Robert	99	6e0LFFmZAnE	1416	1437	Basic informations about the systems of government and the information technology system so the public can, in fact, get access as I say. The best example, he's not here now, is Assemblymember Maienschein. Before he was a Legislator, he put together Project 25 in the city of San Diego which was really all about data sharing.
397	McGuire	Mike	93	LuelkxPlWfo	197	215	And countless media accounts across this state, there have been stories in both rural and urban areas about the challenges associated with vacation rentals. While many vacation rental hosts are simply trying to pay their bills and follow local laws, there are exceptions in every industry.
398	Chiu	David	7	PPBgSxp7D00	558	571	to improve our San Francisco transit system and protect pedestrian safety. And at the outset I want to--Thank you colleagues. I do want to accept the three amendments suggested by this committee and thank the committee staff for their work. Very briefly, TOLE was first authorized by our legislature
399	Chiu	David	7	ASNmI2rHU9I	831	844	With the sticker price of Sovaldi being an $84,000, the, company that marketed the drug actually did not do the R & D, on the drug. It was done by a predecessor company named Pharmaced.
400	Cooley	Ken	45	iF8zLPAheNg	438	470	The outstanding thing that I can share about this bill is, both with respect to the current session and I can't actually I suppose speak to prior sessions, but there is no author currently behind a bill on medical marijuana moving through the process who has invested themselves to the degree and brought original insights, concepts, ideas to the table on how to deal with the environmental aspects of cultivation in the field where it effects people in every county in California.
401	Hancock	Loni	98	B0PWp2aeSfk	1853	1882	And I think that our system now has done a good enough job getting the population down, and we have so many vacant positions that we really, this could be the time to do that. And I would think it would be very telling for the court in terms of, that we are seriously doing what other states have done and bringing our population down and being able to close a prison.
402	Block	Marty	59	HN8BzhqnJIE	1235	1245	We'll take the vote on the motion as it is and if the motion fails, then we will see if we can come to an agreement of what passes. Up to one minute each.
403	Nielsen	Jim	68	S3aN4yPTnBE	1345	1370	I know how, know loved ones that at that particular cemetery, but it, it's a unique place. All of the veteran cemeteries will have their special qualities, as did Yountville, it was a historic one. I was proud to represent it, and it goes way back to the late 1800s. But, but, that Igo one is very special. Well Senator Allen, any questions of these folks?
404	Garcia	Cristina	112	Hc7WoMlUJqU	50	73	Thank you Mr. Chairman and member. I am here to present AB 1017, a bill that would work towards creating a foundation to ensure pay equity for women across the state. Historically, women have been paid less than men in the US. Right now, Latinas make $0.44 to the white male dollar. African-American women make $0.64 and for white women, it's $0.78.
405	Weber	Shirley	44	kIKVbsrTmqg	1026	1039	And that's why I say it is important that we have a plan. You know, that this becomes a priority plan. It's kind of like last year when we said we wanted to basically review all of our facilities. Those residential facilities, care facilities.
406	Frazier	Jim	114	9m9jWFqQWK4	2	17	I see no other questions for the committee,  I do have one and, you know, my pet peeves has been since I've been here.   What public awareness efforts are you currently running with respect to the danger of distracted driving?
407	Mendoza	Tony	52	VHKwUGu3F0g	1072	1092	Thank you, Mr. Chair. Appreciate the opportunity to present A number 8. I would like to begin by offering amendments to be taken to the next committee should this bill get out of committee today to address the concerns raised in the analysis on page three, comment five and on pages three and four, comment six.
408	Cooley	Ken	45	kLTY4thtXsA	279	292	A robust enforcer regulatory scheme is essential for California to bring the medical marijuana industry out from the underground economy and to ensure that patients can receive their product in a safe and legal medicinal way, as intended.
409	Galgiani	Cathleen	95	0XEmXVzSg6Q	2066	2086	Over the years, more than 800 students have participated in this exchange program, making many lifelong friendships while gaining an appreciation for different cultures and traditions and learning about the importance of interdependent economies, positive cross-cultural communication, and international collaboration.
410	Pavley	Fran	104	CW6mZhhMcnU	666	679	Yes, we don't want that. File item eight, Senator Wolk, senate bill 555. Department of Water Resources Urban Retail Water Supplies and Water Loss Audit. Seems like a good idea to me. Let's hear the presentation.
411	Block	Marty	59	hxZ4kK3mSXo	430	444	However, you understand as the author of it, if recreational marijuana becomes legal, then your resolution would permit the banking of recreational marijuana dollars as well, because it doesn't limit it to just medical.
412	De Leon	Kevin	102	P8iQl0Ig1eQ	1590	1611	Certainly, very respectful of that, Mr. Vice Chair. I think again, just to re-emphasize, it's been a lot of hard work on both sides and it's very clear that this is a real, true epidemic. And what we don't wanna do is throw a wide net and capture individuals unnecessarily going through an owner's process that prejudices the good actors.
413	Hancock	Loni	98	kIQkyQM4CnQ	29	53	I really appreciate that our officers deserve something with a broader perspective than the very military and, what I would say lawsuit avoidance that appears to be behind so much of the training now.
414	Hall	Isadore	1	ewcXToh_gOY	189	203	I, talking to the consultant right now, they too have not, seen these amendments. So perhaps maybe your staff neglected to send these over. I don't know, but, we will not be, considering these amendments today.
415	Bloom	Richard	2	4tou47dRNaA	641	660	Thank you Mr. Speaker and members. AB974 the use of 2011 bond funds on projects totaling over $715 million that are consistent with the sustainable community strategies that were adopted by their appropriate metropolitan planning organizations and our shovel ready projects.
416	Pavley	Fran	104	3ZbkIQK-LEk	1395	1414	Nice to see you, Zeke. Anyone else in opposition? All right. Senator Allen, this is the time to ask questions. And I should note for the record we have with us a representative from Fish and Wildlife as well as State Lands Commission.
417	Pavley	Fran	104	45ZR2HT6sPs	551	576	We wanna close that loop hole. It does not limit any but the regulator has to know. So, this is a problem. It is deserving a solution. These are reforms that I think would do well to protect the health and safety of the people that we took our oath to safeguard. Ask for your aye vote.
418	Garcia	Eduardo	38	9aoEJ21mmKA	1542	1557	We've had a number of discussions over the course of years in terms of a price tag to this restoration effort, whether it was a $9 billion Salton Sea alternative that was presented that we all have agreed is not feasible.
419	Stone	Jeff	26	4_9XuAIhx8I	882	902	Thank you for your testimony. Could you elaborate a little bit more on the foster care issue, because I was very concerned on the Riverside County Board of Supervisors when I was a member that after 18 years old, these kids get pushed out and become a part of our criminal justice system instead of investing them in a transition period.
420	McCarty	Kevin	22	mh8x9kvohEc	1947	1956	These high school counselors, they're dealing with sometimes life and death issues, that high school campuses don't have time to talk about FAFSA, financial aid, grants, loans and the works.
421	De Leon	Kevin	102	w3XqiN30Dys	1789	1808	Obviously the voters will make a very intelligent decision if we're able to get this to move forward and convince the governor this is the right thing to do by 2016. But again, I just want to keep mindful of that we've got to make sure that our number is one that resonates with voters.
422	Beall	Jim	92	Rbv3X8-oLv8	202	218	Lots of ideas have been generated, and now its time to sort through those ideas and figure out what is possible to do. We spent a lot of time on this issue and failing to solve the problem only makes the solutions more expensive.
423	Nielsen	Jim	68	Ydll29eHOng	1660	1682	And his testimony probably will never be able to sort out because he was probably one of the few, and that would be under 10 people I would argue, that understand the educational code. And, all those are nicely complicated provisions relating to school finance.
424	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	2aR0NxdG4rc	221	251	Now, under current law, an agency must prepare and certify the administrative record after a challenge is filed, however, in situations where an agency believes a project is likely to be challenged, stakeholder comments we received reflected that it may be more efficient and expeditious if the record is prepared concurrently with the preparation of other project-specific environmental documents, like negative declarations, EIRs, et cetera.
425	Pan	Richard	96	Tb_ZR86SMpk	454	470	This is really about ensuring that our communities have input, that the people who actually work and go to school and their families have input when decision before district makes such decisions. I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
426	Harper	Matthew	14	bencsnxh2-c	244	265	I'm unfamiliar, and perhaps you could help me illuminate, do we have other institutions that may be at similar risk? Is, are there very few students in that situation that are remaining after the approximately 16,000? Or is there a very significant population that we may be setting a precedent for?
427	Rodriguez	Freddie	69	ZTmIOC6QJLc	1272	1288	I've seen firsthand the diseases, how they effect our children and the families and, most of them, how they could have been prevented had they had vaccinations and things of that nature. But I'm really thankful that you're open and trying to work out as much problems as you can, being inclusive of everybody.
428	Hill	Jerry	66	9wfdC9HGDSQ	523	542	Thank you Mr. President. I'm happy today to present a resolution to G.V. Ayers who retired from the Senate Committee on Business Professions and Economic Development in December. G.V. started with the Committee in 1993 before expanding his horizons to service the bureau chief for the cemetery and
429	Levine	Marc	8	xdWYyoTV6kU	746	762	His love and awareness of the environment and the outdoors was instilled in him by his parents, his mother Vena and his father Max. When Bill was young, he often hiked and camped throughout Northern California with his family.
430	Holden	Chris	78	toyLEHK5bMU	2184	2198	Mr. Speaker, I request unanimous consent to suspend joint rule 62A, the file notice requirements to allow the Government Organization Committed to meet and to hear  AB 1295 Levine and AB776 Cooper today, September 11th upon call of the chair in a room to be determined.
431	Pan	Richard	96	Zk_K_zhn8-Q	1444	1459	But I think it's helpful to look at the bigger-picture and say well out of every, out of  our baseline tag you know, revenues since  we are talking about revenues. Where are we spending the money? And some of it's because it's foregone revenue, some of it's because we're spending.
432	Wolk	Lois	94	BaEOFTp-Gc0	933	961	I wanted to return to Dr. Swanson. I think when I left you I was gonna ask you. After your excellent presentation on the ecosystem whether there were any particular alternatives that you think would be a better, would have a better impact and effect on the fisheries. Other than the current proposal?
433	Cooley	Ken	45	N_ZNvKt6lzQ	212	223	In 2011, this senate was looking at doing this sort of topic, it kind of got lost in the budget fight of that year, but that bill was the inspiration for AB 12.
434	Cooley	Ken	45	N_ZNvKt6lzQ	203	212	This is a bill, a broadly supported as a way to take stock of where we are in a regulatory process, and it actually has its roots here in the state senate.
435	Wolk	Lois	94	8vnz5G2is0o	460	483	There has been a dramatic change in public opinion. Two-thirds of Californians now support this approach, including majorities from every demographic sub-group, including physicians. All major California newspapers, and many, many public officials have endorsed SB 128, including most recently, Senator Diane Feinstein.
436	Hernandez	Ed	103	CdKj6oLMa4k	1534	1546	But if they have, let's say you are the employee and I am the employer and I tell you here is my insurance plan, and you buy it all happy because it's well, inexpensive, but it doesn't meet the minimum standards, and you go to the hospital,
437	Wolk	Lois	94	cRT-vVNBfAE	290	328	And has put, and I assume that's still in the budget and I hope it will not be vetoed, 600 plus thousand. However, it was accompanied with a suggestion, a request, a demand that the law that controls this should be changed. The conference committee, the budget subcommittee and the conference committee suggested paying the $7.7 million that it is in arrear back and not to change the law.
438	Hertzberg	Robert	99	20R5DjZ86C8	138	156	And he always, wise gentleman, I should say, not a wise guy. And he always asked the question, which I suspect your Boss always asks, the Governor, and which was really implicit in what Mr. Mcguire said, what you said, in terms of no policy should stay forever the notion of nomenclature and trying to understand.
439	Stone	Mark	20	8AAoooSnIWE	1531	1558	Thank you and I'm happy to work with the DAs on the categories and refining those. It would arguably apply to some violent offenders, and we need to look at that. Because somebody's in prison for a violent crime doesn't mean that they're not eligible or able to be rehabilitated, and again, what we're trying to incentivize is prisoners to address the underlying issues that got them there.
440	Leno	Mark	60	tqB--Js_f48	969	985	If you could convey our thanks to the Governor. And also, I can't tell you the kinds of smiles I see in my district, and I'm sure I'm not alone- when organizations receive a grant from the California Arts Council, it's a day to celebrate.
441	Pavley	Fran	104	AGRN7-GFw2A	898	920	The rationale or the reason for it is, I chair the Water Committee in Protection of Ground Water, which is 60% of our water supply, especially in years of drought is critically important. The reform measures in this particular bill are based on a Commission study, an independent study by the California Council on Science and Technology.
442	Hertzberg	Robert	99	5xYY96cBqDg	1310	1329	It creates a significant problem for us and I just ask you, as a thoughtful Legislator, sitting in similar situation, what would you do under those circumstances, in terms of trying to create conformity in the law that affects all of us in California, versus this issue and looking at one particular option?
443	Block	Marty	59	f1-nJuHExxE	1407	1415	Oh but it's true. And this isn't an issue where we are gonna be flooding the polls now with people who will change elections, this is really a handful of people.
444	McGuire	Mike	93	ZhE_hzRecAQ	103	118	The reforms in AB 403 provide youth with the support they need in foster care to return to the families or to find a permanent home if returning to their families it's not an option. On behalf of Assemblymember Stone and the department, would respectfully ask for your aye vote.
445	Beall	Jim	92	m8iyuGdEmL0	1317	1333	I meant just in a, if you, in hearings from the, from the building inspectors. People that actually do the inspections in terms of the, the expedited review and the process you set up in this regard, so.
446	Mendoza	Tony	52	kbDiQqGDHBM	1314	1324	And evidence base formulary have proven to be an effective tool in other states and would be considered a great tool in California. I would respectfully ask for your aye votes
447	Pan	Richard	96	YovLyNfdmT8	1188	1207	Thank you so much for your presentation and I think I certainly see the advantages on the short-term basis of trying to do the tiers, but I am concerned when we start talking about systematic impacts, when we talk about so called unintended market consequences.
448	Nielsen	Jim	68	TSSAjU2zD6s	1381	1398	How is that different or does it enhance what I think we've already should have been doing? So, are we just duplicating and putting a new name on something or are we really doing something significantly different and better?
449	Mitchell	Holly	64	UgxxQ29DDfk	73	87	So, Mr. Mecco, the five million would then expand training to all worker all workers in addition to, as the agenda suggests, to suggest physicians public safety personnel public gardens and others.
450	Holden	Chris	78	-R4HGT4UbOs	293	309	Mr. Speaker, I request unanimous consent to suspend Assembly rule 45.5 to allow Assembly Members Baker, Dababneh, Mayes, Gallagher, Holden, Mathis, Nazarian, Patterson, Ridley-Thomas, and Wood to speak on an adjournment memory today.
451	Pan	Richard	96	YovLyNfdmT8	1207	1229	So in the short-term, you said, if we do the tiers there's probably less burden. Most people are on larger plans, etc, or so supposedly. And we're talking about industry wide impact. Certainly that's one way to look at it, but each plan or each company actually stands on its own and competes against all the others.
452	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	Ve6b2OIjftM	165	194	Excellent. And the second amendment and the analysis, are you comfortable with that? It references the findings the city take advantages to be able to make findings and declarations when adopting an ordinance to provide for district based elections that change as being made with, furtherance of the purposes of the California Voting Rights Act.
453	Alejo	Luis	9	B4ry1_3tU0U	724	748	I think that was misguided but, unfortunately, you know, there was some forum shopping, where they filed this case in that particular federal district court and; but, we'll hope that the outcome changes as it proceeds on appeal. But nonetheless I think it's a, I think AILAs Southern California chapter is misguided in taking this strategy with this author, rather than working on trying to provide greater clarity.
454	Hueso	Ben	48	Ydll29eHOng	1271	1290	She is survived by her three children, multiple grandchildren, and while she had a very long set of community service experience, I think her legacy is better described as the children she left behind and the grandchildren that she left behind.
455	Medina	Jose	81	BSQ4q6mJlLM	540	570	defend savings on the back of the lowest paid workers. And for that reason, I thank the Senator for bringing it forward, and enjoys support, and we have a motion by Mr. Levine, second by Mr. Jones-Sawyer, the motion before us is do pass to Assembly Accountability. Madam Secretary?
456	Leno	Mark	60	y2dm_Q__xog	18	38	All right, I will keep my promise. Just to start with a quote from the California Department of Public Health, which recommends that, in their words, existing laws currently protect minors and the general public from traditional tobacco products, should be extended to cover e-cigarettes. And that's what our bill will do.
457	Cannella	Anthony	61	Ve6b2OIjftM	155	165	I am comfortable because all of my cities that are not district elections are under 100,000 but the folks that are above 100,000 still face the lawsuits, but it protects my district, so I'm fine with it.
458	Garcia	Cristina	112	fjQhThyumBs	1791	1802	Mr. Quirk talked about the crisis in the 70s. We've been talking about renewables since then. It's been over 40 years, and I want to make sure we're more intentional as moving forward.
459	Chau	Ed	116	0lsNxjB7bP8	1367	1388	Sure, let me, let me take a stab at it and turn it over to Richard. I think there were issues raised by op, opposition as well, but I'll get to those as, as part of my close, perhaps. As to Assembly member Burke's questions now you mentioned that there is current legislation that would prohibit the, the disclosing of information to third parties.
460	Mendoza	Tony	52	r1L5ziee2-s	160	181	Thank you, Mr. Chair, senators. I'm here to present SB 792. This is the other vaccine bill, but not as controversial. SB 792 protects young and vulnerable children from making sure that those who care for them in child care settings are vaccinated against serious contagious disease and illnesses.
461	Hill	Jerry	66	k4GcCA0Jbo4	787	799	Additionally, the bill has no fiscal impacts on state-wide, to state-wide law enforcement. No opposition supported by California Civil Liberties Council and numerous others and is similar to SB 893 from last year, which this committee supported as well.
462	Calderon	Ian Charles	115	2UaCkYNmz0w	242	256	Thank you so much. Any other witnesses that wish to speak. Ok, we're going to call to see if there's any members in the audience today that would like to speak in support of the bill.
463	Levine	Marc	8	sA6uJxeRGKk	1570	1589	The DMV and the polling place. No surprise then that they may assume that the two are linked. Legislators can help make that linkage by ensuring that their states are in compliance with the letter of the law and the intent of the federal motor voter law. This bill does exactly that and I ask your aye vote on AB786.
464	Gallagher	James	108	kLTY4thtXsA	1641	1658	It also provides that the notice that is already being sent to parents informing them that instruction will occur, also contains information outlining the training of the outside consultant instructors in the areas of sexual health or HIV/AIDS prevention.
465	Hancock	Loni	98	rb93slzi3ec	2137	2169	More about this. If we hold it over I think it should come back for vote only because I don't want to go through the whole discussion again. But there are, as a non-lawyer, but a person very concerned about how we get adequate responses so that we put our kids back on track. I would like to be able to talk more with everybody more about the bill and understand exactly how the system actually works.
466	Lara	Ricardo	107	kf7nMeFz9oY	357	370	And, we're committed in the Senate Energy Committee. Perfect, just want to make sure. Members, there's a motion by Senator Hill on AB 802, and it's do pass as amended to the Senate Floor. Secretary, please call the roll.
467	Holden	Chris	78	4HBwd3okHJI	1477	1500	slurpees, to advise on a bill they believe will benefit future franchisees. These small business owners represent the backbone of our economy. They are not demanding everything, but they deserve laws that give them basic protections just like non-franchise contracts are required. For these reasons I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
468	Allen	Benjamin	70	y6U-ceBCkoc	173	188	So in January of this year, the San Bernardino Superior Court ruled that federal mining law preempted the department's regulations of suction dredge mining on federal land since the department could not legally issue permits.
469	Hernandez	Roger	37	4sq_B6zlasQ	757	773	even year elections this is what this bill is striving to do. Respond to the turn outs that have the greatest number of Californians participating that's not be afraid of their voice and their determination that's why I ask for your aye vote.
470	Hueso	Ben	48	9SvrzWegmgM	2005	2016	Thank you very much. We'll go to Kathleen Foote, the senior assistant to attorney general, and antitrust chief in the Attorney General's Office. Thank you, thanks for being here.
471	Chang	Ling Ling	18	qCEr8jDp5Hg	327	346	Similar to the cost of purchasing a home in California our state's average rent also far exceeds the national average. In fact, as of January the average rent in California was nearly 50% higher than the national The reality in California is that regardless of whether you own a home or rent a home, you are faced with some of the highest costs in the country.
472	Hertzberg	Robert	99	scqfU4UsUAo	1343	1351	And for this law with respect to the Department of Insurance do you agree with this analysis with respect to how this bill works. Do we consider those facts unintended consequences?
473	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	XG9g8L3IwGU	96	120	This bill brings these longstanding principles of trespass and privacy into the 21st-century and clarifies how they would apply to unmanned aircraft. Drones was we know have many potentially very exciting and useful innovative purposes but invading our privacy and our property without permission should not be one of them.
474	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	ok4qN3L6USs	1	12	Thank you Chairman. Good afternoon members. I want to begin by accepting the committee amendments and thanking the committee staff for working with my office to come up with a reasonable timeline for this important project.
475	Burke	Autumn	6	fjQhThyumBs	506	516	I didn't wanna be first. First I want to thank, I don't know, we're accepting the amendments, but I want to thank you for the amendments here about the CARB's oversight.
476	Hernandez	Ed	103	qOUtbPV2_wY	257	276	Thank you, Madam Chair and members. The truth is, Henry Waxman once stated, is that cigarettes are the single most dangerous consumer products ever sold. Tobacco remains the leading cause of preventable death, killing 480,000 individuals annually in the United States, 34,000 of which are California residents.
477	De Leon	Kevin	102	OIbMOKdbCjk	960	979	Thank you madame president as well as colleagues. File item number one, we have three appointments before us today. That's Hugh E Crooks, or I should say four, Carolyn Morales, Sean Sergeant, and Gina Truit, these are all a prospective appointments to the California veterans board.
478	Hueso	Ben	48	218-RTK66_I	368	392	Proposition 35 is the most popular initiative in California's history, and that shows that Californians are strongly behind this initiative. Upon passage, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the ACLU filed a temporary restraining order against the requirement for sex offenders to share their online identifiers with law enforcement.
479	Pan	Richard	96	7sM6racHVJs	2097	2111	So, there's certain things you eat that have a certain, we talked about broccoli, but maybe that's no a good example. And you know there's probably some things that have a certain amount of nutrition in them, there's some calories they have attached to that. And there's other things that really the nutritional benefit is quite minimal.
480	Melendez	Melissa	41	6d5kBV-0MQs	592	611	That makes sense. I understand that certainly would make it difficult for any organization, but I think we should all take note of that. That perhaps that's a management issue, where we certainly don't want the Department of Justice continually putting limited term people that's so important.
481	Monning	Bill	25	zEbSrzyLdms	1093	1118	We've heard stories of somebody who's developed a relationship with a resident, a supportive relationship, and they end up leaving for a job at a pizza place because they can, they can get paid more working in a pizza place versus what is really a skilled placement, but at minimum wage.
482	Gallagher	James	108	5dSl7g7OdCI	1414	1434	All my measure does is say hey, let's make this part of the constitution so this never happens again. And some might say, well hey, we already have it in statute. Well, in 2000 we changed the statute to allow retroactive pension increases, and that's how we got into the mess to begin with. So my proposal is that we put this in the Constitution.
483	Stone	Jeff	26	PdAu9Oh2C5Q	2161	2179	And just as an example I took a tour of my district Mr. Chairman this last weekend and I went into a facility where all the patients needed 24-hour care. They were all on respirators, they all were victims of some form of muscular dystrophy.
484	Quirk	Bill	23	4XOeWVTUKok	553	564	It could make it, you know. And again, the Sheriff has the discretion if he gives his discretion to the Chief and he doesn't like what's happening can he take it back?
485	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	5jUUOwMdhxk	869	881	Clearly, First Amendment law is a moving target, but there are also clear tests provided by the Supreme Court, and that's what we relied upon in providing for Christmas.
486	Dahle	Brian	47	yrj_FS0kMm8	589	615	Can you put a white paper together - a list of those things, so that the Chairman and I can sit down and we can start going okay these are areas, not only that he's faced with in his district, but I'm faced with in my district.  I have many, I have 25,000 square miles and communities spread all over that, that are on well and septic or have small water systems who are having the same issues that are faced with in the Tulare Basin.
487	Pavley	Fran	104	TrPgAQvjTc0	1794	1820	I'll close with the third Governor in a row that sort of embraced this goal, that's Governor Brown. He said in the state of the state: our task is to build for the future, not steal from it. I ask for your aye vote.
488	Burke	Autumn	6	ZmQN_cLb26Y	545	559	Think, do you want me to answer? I think this is a process. Obviously there's prior legislation that has started this process and I think we're just slowly moving forward with the comfort level and the electronic delivery but go ahead and answer.
489	De Leon	Kevin	102	dPeGakg4w7Y	191	204	By working with the sub-regional council of governments, COGs to identify party projects, Elliot Mero's is perusing a bottoms-up approach that will result in an ordinance, that reflects unique transportation needs of each area of the county.
490	McGuire	Mike	93	sy4t4DpLFas	14	24	Well good afternoon, almost good afternoon, Mr. Chair and members. Grateful to be here today . First of all, I'd like to start out by accepting the Committee's technical amendments.
491	Cooper	Jim	21	qhIgiujuUww	47	63	We have one more session planned for today, one more block on cost, but I think we've kind of gone over that, and in lieu of time, you'll be our last speaker, so thank you.
492	Lara	Ricardo	107	_skeu0yft7s	1416	1428	Not too long ago it was so difficult to have both farm workers and agriculture come together, and really work in unison on addressing these issues that sometimes tend to be controversial.
493	Gaines	Ted	24	SK-C_51Liio	434	459	I'm just wondering, I know that the housing issue in San Francisco is chronic. And I'm just wondering to what degree is local government allowing for an increase in supply. Are there measures being taken? It appears to me that we have a supply and demand issue as a result of a lot of very successful businesses.
494	Stone	Jeff	26	DwrMQLfFxcs	1043	1058	Okay. How does DDS, who also funds program development activities, coordinate with a SCDD to ensure that both state and federal funds are maximized, and certainly fund unmet or under met needs in this community?
495	Lara	Ricardo	107	Q9Mn4k8Lves	118	137	We're going to move forward with Assemblymemer Ting on the agenda. Mr. Ting, you have a couple items. You're waiving presentation on AB 861 and 1321, is that correct?
496	Gordon	Richard	117	t0rNuwc0CtA	1411	1420	It means that I never really get to see how the money's being spent. I don't know what you did previously. I just know what you want to add or adjust.
497	Rendon	Anthony	120	pqf8UezhQwo	1037	1056	With respect to transparency, AB 825 would allow for the online publication of several documents, including commission approval on energy pricing, hearing records, document transcripts, commission reports and advice letters.
498	Hadley	David	40	gT2_z9UGrSs	1026	1054	I'd like to thank the committee staff for working with us on this bill. With their input, we have made a number of changes. We are also ready to support other amendments that we didn't quite receive in time to make to make this hearing. Ultimately, however, we did not accept one of the staff's suggestions that the residents of the predecessor's school district should all vote on the new district. This is about local control, not about giving the predecessor district the right to veto change.
499	Calderon	Ian Charles	115	nkFf3IHgULc	103	120	However, the amendments did not change. The prohibition against using drones to actually trespass in order to invade another's privacy. AB856 corrects this oversight by adding the words, including airspace above the land, or another in to the definition of physical invasion of privacy.
500	Monning	Bill	25	ho-PTBXT9zU	113	135	Thank you, Madame Chair. Well first I want to thank both departments for your work together in focusing on this particular challenge, the use of pyschotropic drugs. We had an extensive hearing, as you know, with the Committee on Social Services.
501	Stone	Mark	20	pX9sFyhJnT4	1378	1389	So we do have a motion and a second. The motion is to adopt the resolution as amended. Questions, comments from committee members? Seeing none. Ms. Weber you may close.
502	Dahle	Brian	47	DaiegGG5yrM	1546	1557	The devils in the details. If we get this wrong, we're going to look like fools in California, and if we do run businesses out of this state and we drive the price of energy up.
503	Gallagher	James	108	gP-mCxG_DCU	475	490	So there really is no program that would be available and it could be that we're doing, you know, much ado about nothing. We're, you know, there is going to be some cost here according to the EDD and the Department of Justice.
504	Allen	Benjamin	70	uAWOk1QkKOw	98	112	The clinic then builds the state in whichever amount is lower. So, the Department of Healthcare Services then compares the billed amount to the published Medi-Cal rate and reimburses the clinic at the lower of the two amounts. The system obviously causes several problems.
505	Wieckowski	Bob	55	m4t87KOfLMk	54	74	Amendments taken in the Senate Rules Committee on September 10th struck the contents of the bill, and replaced them with language that expands the membership of the Air Resource Board from '12 to '14 with specified requirements for those additional members. The bill was subsequently referred back to this Committee.
506	Mitchell	Holly	64	AO5QavLO0SY	1962	1985	Senator Jackson moves the call. Colleagues if I may remind us all that we're in unfinished business. As such, these are bills that have already been presented on this floor, and we are simply hearing Assembly amendments to take a vote of concurrence, therefore, I would ask that in your presentations you narrow your comments to the amendments taken in the Assembly.
507	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	m48b5iZN1Uo	3	20	Good morning. So everyone find there seat and we begin the Committee on the status of boys and men of color, status hearing on agency and systems leaders progress.
508	Garcia	Cristina	112	-Nb5xJu_Rq4	1084	1108	Yes, yes, so the recommendation by pediatrics and most professionals is for them to be rear facing. Because up until the age of two, there bodies are such that, when there's an accident if not rear facing 75% of them have had pretty big injuries to their backs, to their necks to their spinal cords. And often times can also lead to death and so there's a lot of studies and research.
509	Moorlach	John	4657	HU5u3bnal2k	1455	1483	Thank you Mr. President. I rise in opposition to the bill. The State of California is currently not flushed and we're talking about approximately 400 million in rebates. Mr. President our balance sheet for the State of California, our assets equal our liabilities. State of Texas, the liabilities are one-third of the size of the assets. We've got a long way to go.
510	Monning	Bill	25	Y13vuRnCz5Y	1496	1520	I will just also add on that point, in our bill we billed in for the two physician consultations that are required. If there's any doubt about decision-making capacity our bill provides for the referral to a psyciatrist or psychologist who can assist in that evaluation the decision-making capacity.
511	Pavley	Fran	104	b4USpkALPiM	223	249	Just real briefly, under AB 32, those policies that were in it, it was somewhat controversial when it passed but not that much. We had 45 coauthors in the assembly alone on AB 32. It was more of a celebration than anything else, realizing that there would be broad chance for stakeholder input.
512	Baker	Catharine	74	b4gDbT98z6E	760	778	I'm thinking of other agencies and institutions in the state, like the California State Bar. If I'm an attorney and I move to another law firm, or I change my status and become a government attorney as opposed to a private attorney, I think I have 30 days. And I have to let the bar know, or I'm subject to a penalty or some form of enforcement. Do you have anything like that?
513	Hancock	Loni	98	MYXfbp9UhLY	23	46	There's working out how to make it easier to register, keep it secure registering and make it easier to vote. I think the Colorado model sounds like a very interesting model to consider because it might really take care of the registering and voting piece of this.
514	Bonta	Rob	85	WYVStu1Ty2M	1484	1501	Today I'm honored to have with me two witnesses in support of AB 7. First Mark Grossman, who served as Cesar Chavez's long time press secretary, speech writer, and personal aide, working with him the last 24 years of his life and still serves as a spokesman for the United Farm Workers.
515	Leyva	Connie	62	pqf8UezhQwo	1914	1923	Is that in fact true, that the waste water treatment plants would be allowed to double count? And if they do, why would we not open that option to others?
516	Thurmond	Tony	4	OHndMPLrpTA	1249	1270	Thank you, Mr. Vice-Chair. You're psychic. I wasn't going to say anything on this bill, but I'm happy to engage because what I love about this body is that we can agree to disagree on many things. We have different beliefs, we have different philosophies, and that's what makes this state very strong, and that's what makes this body very strong.
517	Hadley	David	40	csda2pMKJRU	1135	1152	They verify the identity of the person signing a document, they confirm that the document is not signed under duress, they verify the signatory's basic awareness of the contents of the document. And sometimes they're required to take an oath from the signatory that the statements contained in the document are true.
518	Pavley	Fran	104	w3XqiN30Dys	602	614	A deal was a deal, and they put in these structures that when they're decommissioned they would all be removed. So now we fast forward, is this is a different solution or alternative? Time will tell.
519	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	qjDm_sZ-lfo	2076	2091	are not going to be, well we don't think they're going to be subject to start and stop, to start and stop. But if you would satisfy yourself that that is the case, great. If you're concerned, I don't wanna see this bill die because of that, for the reasons you have articulated.
520	Waldron	Marie	29	BsDlxjqmuUc	863	879	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Once I again I thank you for your work on this, I really appreciate it, I think it's a benefit to the patients who are suffering from epilepsy, many of them who can't get their seizures under control and parents who are just distraught over it.
521	Pan	Richard	96	hnhklV-igrA	1497	1512	So the problem is, you have an unvaccinated child who is unknown, who has been exposed, they unknowingly have this disease for two to four days before they develop any symptoms and in that time, other children in the school are being exposed including other children who aren't vaccinated.
522	Mitchell	Holly	64	MN9yRILD2M0	402	413	Well I appreciate the time you spent, both of you yesterday. This is an issue that I have the opportunity to engage in annually as a Budget Committee member.
523	Hernandez	Roger	37	x7WOzO1oE0M	1659	1678	No, no, the reality in L.A. county, I've had a conversation with you today and what I'm trying to get to is that you made a commitment and I know that you said you were going to articulate about that here, that we'll work together on this issue and that we're going to send a message to L.A. county that they need to work on this issue.
524	Gipson	Mike	28	U0AuDbfVwBc	592	612	You are to some extent. I'm just concerned with not enough staff to handle some of the concerns that I'm looking at to address patient care, right? And I'm looking at a report that could suggest the lack of supervision. As well as a lack of individual staff to handle, to address some of the patients.
525	Hertzberg	Robert	99	0yf1SfBcDOs	1527	1542	First, I was really concerned on this rainy day fund because on the one hand, we have a very volatile tax system that I'm trying to deal with where one day we've got revenue's up and one day revenue's down. And so the solution in that regard was to say let's have a rainy day fund.
526	De Leon	Kevin	102	LhZTpLi6UbE	1641	1661	Okay, Thank you, just one last question, a factual question. Do you have any desegregated data with regards to the amount of fires Southern California, Central Valley, obviously Central Valley would be more east towards the Sierras, and Northern California?
527	Wolk	Lois	94	xG-KiREcweY	1920	1942	Alright, those two are approved, 3 to 0. Now I'm moving to item two, which has to do with the permit and enforcement back log reduction. Which we all support strongly, and approve the 16 requested positions as permanent. Require reporting language that requires the department to report by April 1,
528	Mathis	Devon	75	v8nsxSPxdAk	651	669	Yet while we strangle vital life giving water projects in the state with years and years of environmental red tape, sports stadiums, one under construction mere six blocks away gets a pass. And it's not just the Kings Arena.
529	Fuller	Jean	49	c9mBAjkLpP8	253	280	Unfortunately for California, we have 28 public schools on this list; more than any other state. And it's because of the way our funding works that has put us in this position. Of those 28 public schools are currently eligible to receive roughly 240 million to repair and renovate their facilities. However, time is running out.
530	Mitchell	Holly	64	L9_yK97Q24w	420	437	Mr. Chair and members, thank you very much for the opportunity to present this bill that ensures that Dependency Court attorneys can properly serve the foster care children they're appointed to represent. There are 74,000 plus children in foster care in California.
531	Liu	Carol	63	Ir2eiizDgdE	116	141	This bill requires all public school districts and charter schools to develop a tobacco ban policy, and post signs at the entrance to school grounds, regardless of whether the school receives Prop 98 funding. This bill adds language to the health and safety code to expand the definition of tobacco products to include electronic cigarettes, vaping devices, snuff, chew, and other forms of smokeless tobacco.
532	Maienschein	Brian	84	H1w8G5JZSXc	107	117	The bill will ensure that both public safety and the well-being of the prisoner are maintained by improving communication between the prisoner's primary mental health team and the independent evaluators
533	Hill	Jerry	66	WSgME_YGSpo	546	565	maybe with your leadership, could promote that in some way. Another question I had in terms of, you talked about your authority, currently, related to review of all of the actions of different boards.
534	Bloom	Richard	2	Lkk9mVJ5y6k	367	392	Particularly given their additional responsibilities relating to the drought. There have been a number of conversations going on around this issue. I'm pretty confident that we're going to arrive at a resolution that leaves the positions as proposed by the administration.
535	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	oC8-KbPE6Yo	922	943	And this year SB 612 builds on efforts of the previous past two years where we want to bring clarity and consistency on some of the more problematic issues that have necessitated additional conversations with stake holders, including issues that have arisen with some of the other programs CUPAs are charged with overseeing.
536	Bonilla	Susan	3	n81cNAsH1gw	713	729	I apologize I wasn't here for the whole discussion. And so please let me know if it's already been discussed but I got an opposition letter from NAMI, the family members. And their concern is around the 72 hour hold. They're opposed unless that issue is dealt with.
537	Mitchell	Holly	64	WQvzzUrj4uM	502	519	Say it again, is there objection to the use of a previous roll call? No objection, thank you. Aye's - 23, no's - 8, the motion, Senate rules are suspended. Senator Monning.
538	De Leon	Kevin	102	A4tFO9bb3f0	1545	1560	Walk us through a little bit on the ambitious goal of the 50% reduction in petroleum use and how through the Governor's vision, through the Energy Commission's vision, we plan to get there.
539	Ting	Philip	30	aeg7bKVq3No	1387	1407	I noticed that the districts offices were fairly evenly distributed, but in terms of accounts, obviously each district has a significant variance in accounts. So, could you walk us through how you do the district offices? For example, I know for Ms. Ma, her district is very large, but she doesn't have a district office south of San Jose.
540	Galgiani	Cathleen	95	miQ0Fm1d12I	125	150	However, the conclusion of this required meet and confer period, a school district can still vote to override local zoning. This override stands, unless a judge determines that this board's decision was arbitrary and capricious. SB313 would clarify the process for school siting, by adding a cross-reference to existing law, regarding the acquisition of ag zoned land for a new school site.
541	Stone	Mark	20	qBs9W23Am_w	1799	1824	And, that workforce is performing the tasks that traditionally are governmental, and I think that's one of the things that is a thread running through here. Interestingly, in talking to my courts about this, the word that sort of customarily performed, because they took me through a number of contracts that they currently have, and have done for a while.
542	Daly	Tom	118	Mfs9_24i5lo	1931	1950	The bill does not create or empower the department of insurance to do anything additionally in terms of regulations. I want to propose an author's amendment to correct a small drafting error in the language and again to clarify the bill calls for a one time filing and only a one time filing.
543	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	emhy9UKtKg0	1708	1729	So let's do this. Given the fact that the Assemblymember isn't here, these are good questions. We don't necessarily have the answers. I would like to propose that we put this over. We do have time, we can put it over a week. We'll have the Assemblymember here. You heard some of the questions that were asked, let's get some answers to them.
544	Alejo	Luis	9	LXP_ciN3hzY	947	969	Too often during the aftermath of a national tragedy, sometimes emotions cloud our judgment, and the interment camps continue to stand as a symbol of one of the greatest injustices of a government that failed to protect its citizens and that all Californians should continue to advocate for the rights of all our friends and our neighbors in our state.
545	Leno	Mark	60	AKlY8gGN95I	1197	1217	So we're on the same track as they are. We hope that they are just about to make their determination now because they're the federal government. What it would mean is that, not unlike other tobacco products, they could not any longer be advertised on television, which they are right now.
546	De Leon	Kevin	102	Lmzm4UU691s	1791	1802	Okay, no just, okay. No, no, no, no, that's fine. I just wanted to make sure there was a, a question embedded there somewhere in that, that commentary. Okay, right, okay. Madam Vice Chair.
547	Hall	Isadore	1	vwnSyW8C-l8	312	337	When I when I was in my fraternity we had a saying, a poem, that we used to recite. It's called "Excuses". It says, " Excuses are tools of the weak and incompetent used to build monuments of nothingness. Those who excel in it, seldom excel in anything else."
548	De Leon	Kevin	102	PcpmEqtLP1M	368	380	We've signed agreements with sovereign nations, just recently with China as well as Mexico and other nations around the world, to coordinate our efforts to share best practices and to commit to even further action.
549	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	gAr6GrRaKTs	608	619	Thank you. Any other members of the public wish to speak in support. You may, excuse me, you may state your name, your position... Your name, affiliation and position.
550	Liu	Carol	63	6q5JSfST1YQ	75	90	We'll also meet in criteria for air pollution standards in achieving green house gas reduction targets. The California Transportation Plan is a statewide long range transportation strategy that guides transportation decisions and investments.
551	Liu	Carol	63	6q5JSfST1YQ	60	75	This bill is a follow up to SB 391 which I authored in 2009. SB 391 required updates of the California Transportation Plan to address how the state will meet its transportation infrastructure and mobility needs.
552	Pavley	Fran	104	M0MScnK_2Tc	895	911	One way it's different is that we're looking at putting our bill in as a chapter of the Groundwater Sustainability Management Act, and they're looking at just amending the code of procedures, civil procedures code.
553	Chiu	David	7	wK5CwGDTeOM	1391	1410	All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote.
554	Anderson	Joel	57	bcyIxM2tSYs	884	903	I'm still a little bit confused. If I'm blind and I want to vote, so where would I have to go? Would I go to the typical precinct place I've gone over time or do I have to go to a different place?
555	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	YGvsvPIzjxQ	403	428	And this is a measure that will help us to achieve that and allow us to continue taking the necessary steps to create safer and healthier educational environments for our kids, which will not only help reduce the incidence of sexual assault, but instill in them positive, lifelong values for men and women within our communities.
556	Runner	Sharon	4656	_H7zvwgU_3w	1539	1561	But we haven't done that on other parts of the 5, the 405 and others that have HOV lanes, to allow that use during non-essential commuter hours. So there are some things like that, we in Southern California can't go in and out the HOV lanes, they're double-lined.
557	Chiu	David	7	s9iyNkaYYTE	1202	1209	Could you talk about why you think that has been the case? And then maybe for the Committee if you could just take a step back and explain what these credits are and what this drop-off really means.
558	Leno	Mark	60	Ir2eiizDgdE	812	827	There's no place else on Earth you get nicotine, but from tobacco. It is a tobacco product. Beyond that, and you can't make this stuff up, but I'll share you a wonderful little story, one of the major players in the industry called NJOY.
559	Gatto	Mike	46	mXX7qM53na4	945	964	The opposition uses some other inflammatory language. They say that, "Gee, if we somehow affect the amount of people who object later on to experiments being done 20 years after their child was born, on their child's blood, without their knowledge, that this is gonna reduce the sample sizes of this group or that."
560	Stone	Jeff	26	jSkO5GUtg1k	965	986	So I'm all in favor of comprehensive regulations that protects the water supply. The one thing the State of California routinely does, is we tend to over regulate, and push those jobs away, and even potentially out-of-state, so I hope that you'll take that into consideration that we certainly want to protect, but we don't one over regulate people out of business.
561	Gipson	Mike	28	ehjG4WNbq0w	1586	1607	Thank you very much. Is the affected agency here? And we would like to invite you to the table to give your testimony.  Thank you very much. Please state your name and the agency in which you're representing.
562	Weber	Shirley	44	_YWoRdtfoP8	1060	1074	I think I've made my point. If I -- you know, if I give you my support today, I hope it's because we're going to continue to work on this. We're going to take that 10% much, much higher. We're going to deal with some of the issues that others have raised here.
563	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	0LdXFnPqPCk	1363	1380	To also know that the Alabama Governor now, Robert Bentley, is against affirmative action, is against immigration, is against gay rights and civil union, that he is kind of continuing what George Wallace has done.
564	Hertzberg	Robert	99	3ZbkIQK-LEk	238	253	Well, just like what happens, good intentions go along, five years has happened, and there has been no such decommissioning. We know, I'm told, that there's three that are sitting in the wings now to go. But the process is so difficult because of the number of agencies.
565	Bloom	Richard	2	_fRo9qb8Uik	594	617	And sometimes things take on a tenor that is unfortunate. And that was where things were headed with this discussion many months ago. So I'm very pleased that we're in a better place today. I think that, I'm hoping that things will continue to improve and that these proposals will continue to improve.
566	Monning	Bill	25	0s2AT7xf_D0	2051	2077	And, it's just a win-win for everybody, it encourages our local agricultural production and close farm to consumer, transfer and it does, if families can get more, they're gonna be drawn to the farmer's markets and, and buying more healthful foods, so, I think it's a great plan.
567	Wolk	Lois	94	4eIdwcDuXeo	1419	1440	And, to satisfy the most skeptical of my Central Valley and Delta colleagues. Is there any reason to believe that these bond funds are being held back, or being proposed in this fashion to fund the BDCP?
568	Santiago	Miguel	17	LjL6ZVCwjY0	149	170	Are there things that the UC system can help us to think creatively to do? Are there regional approaches when you're taking a look and instead of top 9% across the State of California high schools, can you take a look at 9% across regions? Because we know that it'll capture then the type of students that we want to be able to capture into these universities.
569	Baker	Catharine	74	VL9wjf3H8Kg	2325	2345	Many of us may have examples of terrific veteran centers at community colleges in our district one of mine is Las Posita college. So, having a counselor is just the beginning I think having a space and the tremendous more support the doesn't segregate our veterans students but does support them.
570	Pavley	Fran	104	hP3pxZDGmwM	131	156	It's double referred to Environmental Quality for issues relating to CEQA, and to the water boards, they will be discussed there, so as you're thinking of your testimony today, please keep in mind that this is the Natural Resources and Water Committee, and if a bill is double referred, that means there's jurisdiction in several areas under state law and the procedures of the House.
571	Gallagher	James	108	dbbXRXVYxHY	406	417	The kids that left this class reportedly went home to their parents saying that they were embarrassed, and that they even felt pressured to have sex, and that they were abnormal for not wanting to.
572	Leno	Mark	60	4HKs3ChJG74	854	872	Thank you for that overview. Senator Pavley, I just wanted to bring your attention to some intent language. And Ms. Bosler, I don't think we've put this into statute before. Intent language, it says, it is our intent that the general fund savings derived from the closure of state developmental centers
573	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	qW3ZYP7zbss	1400	1433	I have a way of looking at legislation that is probably very similar to what you do. And I tell people all the time, and as we move forward with this, Stephanie Richards, I have the four cs, communicate, cover, consequences, and costs. And so as a recovering bureaucrat I tell people, go talk to the people who have to implement it, because a lot of times we in the Legislature, we create things and it is not enough money or it's just a stupid idea or it just doesn't make any sense.
574	Leno	Mark	60	4eIdwcDuXeo	830	845	So that's already in statue, we all agree on that. Do we have an understanding or a vision, a goal as to where we want to get to if the number is approximately a million can't drink their tap water now?
575	Gomez	Jimmy	80	QXW5aikdMmE	1914	1928	AB 818, Quirk, additional comparisons of DNA and fingerprint evidence in a criminal procedure holding committee. AB 909, Quirk, annual report on sexual assault crimes and actions taken by local law enforcement agencies. Do pass republicans now voting.
576	Baker	Catharine	74	mltOigqY7Qc	892	919	This bill is necessary because they're not subject to any open meeting regulations at all right now. The Committee did adopt last year its own internal open meetings policy for the first-time and it's almost ten years of existence, but the policy's not sufficient, it actually is used, within sole discretion of the Committee Members, whether any meeting should be public or closed, and it also allows the Committee to expunge its own record. So there would be no record of meetings happening, or findings.
577	Weber	Shirley	44	7bdBeI04iMY	50	68	academically and socially for the first grade. What we learned from last year's experience as we know we went forward is that we've added a provision in this bill now that was raised by the opponents that added a section that specifically state this bill does not stop a parent I'm applying for home school their children instead of
578	Gomez	Jimmy	80	rXqXXOdeL9w	655	667	And they designed some very interesting drop boxes where even if people try to throw something inside them to set them on fire, they're constructed in a way that creates a vacuum and doesn't allow the fire to even catch.
579	Gipson	Mike	28	Smx7pNnpEJQ	1845	1860	Another example, March 24, 2013 San Jose Mercury news article talks about American Indian model schools in which 3.8 million of questionable funds, system rife with conflict of interest. Including construction contracts and lease agreements.
580	Hall	Isadore	1	99kPN2IqWBc	48	64	This compact contains no revenue share requirement between the state and the tribe relating to payments being paid into the general fund. However, the tribe will be required to make payments into the Special Distribution Fund, the SDF, as specified.
581	Leno	Mark	60	SuJy5eE040k	1607	1621	No, you don't have my support for it necessarily, but in this pretense that it was just for three years, oh, and then we're gonna up it, even though we agreed to a lower amount and then we're gonna come back a fourth year and with no guarantees that it doesn't come back in the fifth or the sixth.
582	Leno	Mark	60	TSSAjU2zD6s	68	107	Will our federal and state investments in adult education and career technical education meet the challenge? Will we provide Californians with the skill sets needed in a quickly changing global economy? Will employers find an appropriately trained work force, or will they have to look elsewhere? The governor's proposed budget would integrate requirements of the federal work force innovation and opportunity act to develop a unified state work force investment plan, including eight hundred million additional dollars in funding.
583	Hill	Jerry	66	XrOqCob7jCo	297	308	In terms of the Accountancy Board, the bill will extend the sunset date to 2020 and also allow the board to place certain practice restrictions on an accountant based on disciplinary action taken against them by the Board.
584	De Leon	Kevin	102	xrb7OkoktfM	1054	1074	Thank you very much, Senator Stone. Thank you very much, Sister Michelle Gorman. Now colleagues, it is a pleasure and honor to swear in one of our newest members of the California State Senate, who will be joining us in the red carpet that is,
585	Rendon	Anthony	120	goLRzsDXvfE	117	133	Thank you Mr. Speaker and members. I rise in strong support of AB 47. We just finished a conversation about poverty and issues relating to poverty. Early childhood education particularly state preschool is a program that I'm quite familiar with. I worked in the field for about 20 years.
586	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	YGvsvPIzjxQ	314	338	Statistically, the numbers are staggering, in the extent to which dating violence exists in this country. In fact, research shows that about one in three U.S. teens between the ages of 14 to 20 have been victims of dating violence. And about the same number say they have committed relationship violence themselves.
587	Rendon	Anthony	120	goLRzsDXvfE	133	153	There's no better poverty program than early childhood education. There is no program that helps to address long-term and systemically the problems relating to poverty and the cycle of poverty that we suffer from in our state and in our country. This is a good bill. This is a bill that will have tremendous benefits in the future and I urge your aye vote.
588	Chavez	Rocky	83	ElqG9zhDxtM	519	530	You'll hear from the opposition today, that family members are not deserving of the sacrifice of veterans, those who bore the sacrifice should receive the benefits, they all say.
589	De Leon	Kevin	102	A1UTGLmNv2E	695	728	It's a very vibrant El Salvadorian community and we also extend our great condolences to the victims, many of them who were Salvadorian and who lost their lives in the fire just recently in the mission district. Now since the signing last year of a $277 million millennium challenge compact, the governments of United States of America and El Salvador are working together more closely than ever to invest in mutually beneficial infrastructure, education, regulatory reform projects.
590	Kim	Young	82	NRrL3g0f7-g	679	705	But, you know, the reason why I'm struggling with this one, because currently, parents, if they don't enroll their children in kindergarten, they do so probably in other ways, either sending them to private schools, or either they keep them at home and they provide other means to provide the necessary skills
591	Weber	Shirley	44	9NVb2cnRnt4	684	694	Mr. McCarty and I talked about that at the beginning and the process of dealing with budgets and money coming in and expenditures if you're trying zero-based budgeting you not going to meet the June deadline starting in January.
592	Hueso	Ben	48	LVzFkfmZq9U	1050	1073	This bill would authorize the Department of Motor Vehicles to issue enhanced driver's license which individuals could use at border crossings as proof of both identity and citizenship. The EDL will be enhanced in process technology and security to denote identity and citizenship.
593	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	iTrvWXqiedk	1662	1673	You said that there's case law on this that says you absolutely do so. So that, have we resolved that there, that you do have the jurisdiction unless this bill precludes you from doing so?
594	Pan	Richard	96	vuTgADMvFlA	997	1003	So in addition to just saying that we're gonna deal with rates and so forth, we also need to have mechanisms in place to ensure that the quality is there.
595	Leno	Mark	60	D32BRjJtFrw	1234	1252	So again, thank you all for all the time and effort that we have put into this so far. We've made great strides, and I'm confident that not only do we meet our June 15th deadline, but it will be a budget that the people of California will be proud of. So, thanks again, we are adjourned.
596	Calderon	Ian Charles	115	A2CxN21_Gyw	486	504	Thank you, Madame Chair. I'll go ahead and get started while my witnesses join me up here. Good afternoon, Madame Chair, members. As Californians increasingly use and store information online, services like YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and email, it is important for
597	Dahle	Brian	47	oE98JCD72Xk	808	835	And I did actually attend the scoping period two years ago with Assemblymember Chasboro when we had the scoping period for AB 32. And I brought to the attention of Mary Nichols that fact that we have forest fires, which are emitting carbon and they called that neutral. So, I'm concerned about how we
598	Harper	Matthew	14	Z5dUcZuiBfw	662	680	Shoppers want relief from higher grocery bills, not higher costs. For these reasons, I respectfully ask for an aye vote and for discussion on this often ignored part of this law.
599	Chau	Ed	116	14lq834z9Pc	47	63	Computing and information technology will play a key role in creating a workforce pipeline for a cybersecurity career as well. As we move towards a technology-intensive society the state must do more to bring computer science to all students,
600	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	Mfs9_24i5lo	875	898	So we don't have to do cash grants, food stamps, housing vouchers, at the same level. If they have unemployment insurance and they can negotiate with their utility providers and their landlords or if they're, if they're paying a mortgage the bank in order to to to make it through the summer and to build financial security.
601	Mitchell	Holly	64	tOhAw6uVpYA	354	369	I would just say that based on legislation that I've carried previously and our conversations around my priorities, I appreciate the efforts around the 24 month clock, 24 month, what do you call it?
602	Liu	Carol	63	gN6B3iXXHo0	519	547	Caltrans currently owns 399 residential properties, with 490 housing units. The single family units comprise 310 rented, 33 vacant, and 14 not habitable. There are 93 rented multifamily units. 15 are vacant, and 25 are not habitable. Of historical significance are 83 single family houses.
603	Bonilla	Susan	3	oSkLr6XY8ps	543	569	Okay. When we're talking about, and I appreciate Mr. Woods' comment, that, we're using the word increase a little freely when there was and there have been so many substantial cuts and the system is clearly laboring and entering a crisis if we don't contemplate restoration of the cuts.
604	Bonta	Rob	85	tf_1MHXwKaY	257	277	So it's a Medicare floor with an IDRP on top of it. And that squarely in the middle of the negotiations, we think that, after, as far as we've come, with the different options that were on the table, this is a fair approach to addressing this very critical issue for consumers and patients in the State of California.
605	Weber	Shirley	44	kIKVbsrTmqg	598	614	As you pointed out by finance, it's 2.5 -- I mean 3.0. At the smallest it's considered 2.5. I would -- I applaud the two of you who brought the issue forward. It's one that obviously as a state we're going to have to deal with aggressively.
606	Grove	Shannon	77	b2XLo4I9yzU	505	523	About a conspiracy to commit fraud by three OPS officers for fraudulently abusing their overtime practices and billing the state for overtime which it should not have been billed for. So are you guys gonna investigate, is there, what's the money going to be used for in this?
607	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	4l5FjBTBUZQ	95	112	beaches to enjoy the coast for Memorial Day weekend. The two coastal areas, El Capitan beach and then Refugio beach where the spill took place, had to be closed because of the mess made by this oil. They remain closed today by the way and
608	Hertzberg	Robert	99	Wq4BKtQGDbc	329	337	But this number on kids is just, you know, I was there fighting for the 18 year old voter as a kid and now we're not turning out, right?
609	Bonta	Rob	85	Tqcxk8QJsXU	504	519	By basing it on the Medicare fee schedule the Legislature ensures that a physician are being paid based on a transparent and public publicly available database that we can all see, we all know what it says, we're starting from the same set of facts and almost every physician accepts Medicare as payment in full in the State of California, especially those that provide hospital based care.
610	Levine	Marc	8	9ZvAfunEMro	357	371	Let me educate people who have never heard of lichen before and then I'll give you what you're looking for Senator. So lichens are unique because they consist of both a fungus and an algae living together as one organism.
611	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	EQZBghQKoaM	51	65	Traditionally, public works contracts have included penalties for contractors that fail to deliver projects on time. Common penalties include liquidated damages, which have a set dollar amount that both the agency and the contractor agree to prior to signing the contract.
612	Low	Evan	11	EWFYx7q92DQ	1181	1203	Thank you very much. I appreciate the insight on the importance of fingerprints in terms of theft, properties, etc. Would you apply this similar type of philosophy towards for example, the similar industries of the internet economy, Ebay, Craigslist, any other opportunity similarly in terms of identifying and
613	Alejo	Luis	9	gP-mCxG_DCU	145	159	With me today to speak in support of this bill are Louis Brown  representative of coalition of the Chamber of Commerce, California Farm Bureau and representatives of the Western Growers Chamber of Commerce, Family Winemakers, and many others. This bill has no opposition. And we ask you for your aye vote.
614	Block	Marty	59	dfTR-5X2bxg	135	149	It's supported by two dozen organizations including Small Business California, the National Federation of Independent Businesses, California Asian Pacific Chamber of Commerce, California Black Chamber of Commerce, California Disabled Veterans Business Alliance, and others.
615	Chau	Ed	116	mOqF8MknDiY	1189	1221	Thank you for your testimony. Anyone else in opposition to the bill, please step forward, there's a mic there. Seeing and hearing none, lets bring back to the table all the proponents as well for questions and answers if they would like to come back up to the table, as well as the opposition if you'd like to stay at the table.
616	Pavley	Fran	104	YrZrpwtmLSQ	1707	1715	I can bring home $3,500 a month and not have to worry about that $1,000 a month for 20 years to pay off my student loan. I can afford to do this.
617	De Leon	Kevin	102	DDRuG0CC7zE	1260	1272	I think the community college system is going to be very critical for the future growth of the State of California for the vast majority of young people who will not attending a four year university.
618	Leyva	Connie	62	TKhvu3W6NHQ	620	643	Very good, thank you very much. I have a question from one of the local water districts in the district. First of all, all of them that emailed us are very happy with you and very happy with the job that you're doing. But Fontana Water Company was wondering what additional tools to the state and local boards need to be more aggressive and proactive in protecting local water supplies from polluters.
619	Hertzberg	Robert	99	hp2WTRF5hkg	1479	1487	But the part of this has happened is that we've also had this stuff going on for 10, since Kehoe's bill, whenever that was, 15, 12 years ago, whenever we did that. I, I don't know how many years ago it was.
620	Dababneh	Matthew	50	w8nI6ofQavM	180	193	Especially Stanford and USC when it came to Cal grants and I stuck out and said to the governor that we need to ensure those schools get their fair share of the Cal grant funding. I will be very clear though, we are not going to try to reinvent the wheel here.
621	Alejo	Luis	9	bzJzCS8XdVc	2033	2052	And in September 2013 15 Republican legislators held a press conference, the first ever in this building, in support of immigration reform. So we have weighed in on legislation and resolutions together, including the one authored by Senator Vidak this year also calling for comprehensive immigration reform.
622	Cannella	Anthony	61	SU8_KAMcIaE	1059	1070	And, that's difficult when we have a perceived punitive system that drives businesses out of the valley and ships them off to other states because they can't be competitive.
623	Hertzberg	Robert	99	Wt_ez7F9UlE	420	435	And then when you look at the analysis, it talks about 11135 of the government code, but I'm understanding how you make that, and that's all about prejudice. Sexual orientation, and those types of things. So, I don't understand how this deals with the issues you're talking about.
624	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	kMP7GilTLLE	1061	1084	But existing law requires breach notifications be made in the most expedient time possible without unreasonable delay and specify certain information that must be included in these notices. The law provides the breach notifications must be written in plain language but is otherwise silent about how the information should be presented or organized.
625	Hertzberg	Robert	99	WJQRNP9q0xQ	1494	1505	And secondly, the issue that Senator Moorlach raised, which is what's the bite on the general fund, you know, we've now had, what, I think the staff said it was $2.8 billion for every, annually on the schools.
626	Leno	Mark	60	uAWOk1QkKOw	1457	1468	So this makes both fiscal and good policy sense and also it will help improve the lives of many people who are struggling with behavioral health issues. I would ask your aye vote.
627	Anderson	Joel	57	awDmkCorXdo	580	603	I would. A personal note in one of my cities, the city of La Mesa. About 20 years ago we had an incident. It was a dog that kept going into the neighbors yard. So, the animal control officer was called, he showed up, only to stumble into the largest meth lab in San Diego county.
628	Wood	Jim	72	9fvwP7KwrvY	1069	1095	And it does that because whether the medical board is the appropriate entity to oversee nurse practitioners and primary care physicians isn't the question to me, or isn't the issue to me, the issue is that as you transition nurse practitioners to primary care providers you cannot deny that you are now practicing medicine independently.
629	Anderson	Joel	57	omDEH7LCBKo	480	503	As you're moving forward with this, I know it's all early, but to me that's a building-block. Without having that you're not taking it seriously. I would think that would be one the first priorities because why would you ever want to spend time trying to build a relationship that is out of the range from the very get go.
630	Wagner	Donald	88	jAVMxyN_c9U	861	876	We are hurting ourselves. We're hurting our future, we are hurting our economic opportunities, we are making business unpredictable in the State of California, chasing some chimerical goal that we can never get to.
631	Gallagher	James	108	B4ry1_3tU0U	1500	1517	Mr. Chairman, just a quick kind of a language question. I see in the amendments from the committee that we have this sub-part D that talks about any relief offered under any executive action announced or executive order issued.
632	Weber	Shirley	44	1dDkNt95rgU	1305	1324	Where before, you had to hustle and find the money, either in another program or in a grant program or some other relationship that's there. But we're saying to Foster Youth Services, you're important enough for the state to fund you at $25 million this coming year, which we've not done in the past.
633	Calderon	Ian Charles	115	oILGaAiOKQI	84	99	1153 addresses a technical issue needed to monitor outcomes, and will also enable more meaningful dialogue to occur on specific LCAP goals. I respectfully ask for an aye vote. And with me in support today, I have Brad Strong on behalf of Children Now.
634	Mitchell	Holly	64	w14C8IiFUpY	1804	1817	It's not just about you getting the job. All of those things need to be in place because as you talked about, it was the five days of childcare that allowed you to go out and look for a job. Is that fair?
635	Hancock	Loni	98	zZG9dtpoc3o	535	568	Gotcha. Yeah, yeah. I think it's a commonsense requirement to have.  Again, when you're in the middle of a national debate about resisting arrest and stopping people and then it leading to other things I would like to know if it causes a problem.
636	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	ZM99l_dNJfs	1067	1080	OK. Would you or do you think your board of supervisors might have a position on standard-- making a statewide standard or as you're updating your voter system, are you looking at things like that?
637	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	A_iRTPZL_LQ	103	121	The victim of the police beating subsequently died. The police returned devices with the video of the intent deleted.  Increasingly, as the public captures policed practices on video, it is critical that we send a message altering or deleting these videos will not be tolerated.
638	Thurmond	Tony	4	EmQFEn7-288	243	258	Thank you, Miss Grove. You know, while you were making your point, I watched the chief and she nodded. I know that you have some stakeholder groups, chief, and if you want to come back up, you know, in case there are questions.
639	Rendon	Anthony	120	hrVBNy8V670	330	345	But we can direct the PUC to pay for the cost of the justice system to review its decisions in the same way that the Department of Corrections pays the justice system's cost for prosecuting crimes committed in prison and it may offer a model for us here with respect to the PUC.
640	Hill	Jerry	66	4tVR58n3Ljg	878	915	Thank you for your willingness to continue your participation and service and we will be in recess until 15 minutes after adjournment of the joint session downstairs. Thank you. Yes, we did save the best for last.
641	Mendoza	Tony	52	g1KhSxf2FKA	588	601	Yeah that, no. But if it passes next year, the county has to draw up the lines anyway. They just have to do these parameter, which you can draw seven seats instead of five. Now, remember this is a minimum of seven, now the county can choose to go higher if they want.
642	Eggman	Susan Talamantes	73	DEi_8R7XWOE	971	988	If that water is not taken back out and used within five years, the person loses their rights to water. So this bill does not define underground storage in and of itself as a beneficial use. We think all, we all agree that protecting our groundwater in our basins in critical for the environment, agriculture, and our communities.
643	Wagner	Donald	88	EQZBghQKoaM	408	422	Well, let me follow up on that. All right. So the contract says, consequential damages of, you know, liquidated damages of maximum consequential damages and why. Each contract happens, is it automatic?
644	Levine	Marc	8	HccZsvAseDo	850	877	Each year they welcome an estimated 10 million visitors to the bridge and an estimated 40 million vehicles cross the bridge. Please join me in welcoming the following members of the district to the capital: Dick Grosboll, President of the Board of Directors, Janet Reilly, Director, Gerald Cochran Director, Denis Mulligan, General Manager, and Amorette Ko-Wong, Secretary of the District. Thank you in joining me to welcome them today.
645	Quirk	Bill	23	8MjX_09Duus	130	157	Such delay has implications for public safety, with 911 calls now coming predominantly from cell phones, economic growth, and the ability for many individuals to access the Internet. Members, wireless infrastructure is essential to satisfy the need for more and more bandwidth and to extend the benefits of wireless communications into as many communities as possible.
646	Bates	Pat	58	gN6B3iXXHo0	1935	1952	I am concerned Senator Mitchell with, the, the broad definition of mold. Reason being, I live on the coast, and it is continuing issue. You know, we have it in our house, and we have to kinda deal with it now, and then especially, during the foggy times.
647	Holden	Chris	78	JKPJXBAVEPo	217	238	These vehicles are equipped with seat belts, brake lights, and additional safety features as required by law. AB 173 would remove the sunset date on this law, which would otherwise expire January 1st, 2016 to ensure that these vehicles remain a vital tool to the universities, and retirement facilities, and the city of La Verne.
648	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	U9EPCHTiWm8	68	83	The motion for those bills will be do pass, and the amendments will be processed by the appropriations committee. These bills are, SB 210, SB 271, SB 276, SB 359 and SB 369.
649	Holden	Chris	78	JKPJXBAVEPo	238	250	This bill is supported by the La Verne Police and Fire Departments and enjoy bipartisan support in the Assembly. I'd like to thank you for your consideration of this measure. And I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
650	Lara	Ricardo	107	XCFU_0j8dAo	1612	1627	So to the communities like commerce, for example, like Oakland, that already have these other, you know, not only disadvantaged, but they have horrible air pollution. We're saying we're going to put now the high speed rail in your community.
651	Lara	Ricardo	107	XCFU_0j8dAo	1627	1640	And, that's going to mitigate, you know, all the other issues surrounding. And so, to me I say, we're adding, this is another stressor. I believe in the high speed rail. I know it's going to get to what we're trying to do in reducing GHG.
652	Mitchell	Holly	64	Emq8Vus1fxY	1714	1731	Appreciate it. Moving on to item number 14, second to the last item we'll take up today. California Gaming, Gambling Education and Treatment Services. CalGETS, is that the way we pronounce your acronym? All right, CalGETS, page 55 on the agenda.
653	Mitchell	Holly	64	Emq8Vus1fxY	1698	1712	None for me. Finance. LAO. Any public comment on the last five items? Okay, seeing none it's a staff recommendation that we hold all of these items open and we'll do that. Thank you very much for your time today.
654	McGuire	Mike	93	kjbtobUTSlE	993	1013	wine. He was dedicated to Northern California and rather than keeping his self-made fortune to himself Mr. Treoni donated millions back to the community found in the Luther Burbank performing arts center created and funded Anadel state park and co founded the Sonoma county community foundation.
655	Dababneh	Matthew	50	n57XOOZPs8w	1876	1893	I'm glad to be not only someone that supports it I'd like to be added as a co-author. This is really important when you think about that only 12%t of California homeowners have earthquake insurance, most of my constituents don't even realize that that traditional homeowner's insurance does not cover earthquake damage.
656	McGuire	Mike	93	61mjtvwgQdA	103	121	We're grateful that Dr. Karen Baylor is here, she's Deputy Director of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services with the Department of Health Care Services. We're grateful that Dina Kokkos-Gonzales is here. She's Chief in the Mental Health Services Division, Department of Health Care Services.
657	Alejo	Luis	9	eiRf682j8LU	429	447	And last year, this legislature in a bipartisan manner, supported ACR 168, which called onto the Washington NFL team to do the same and change its mascot. Even the US patent office removed any patent protections for that name became of its offensive nature to Native Americans.
658	Bonta	Rob	85	iF8zLPAheNg	683	700	Thank you Mr. Speaker and members. This is the third bill of the triad of bills that you've heard us talk about tonight regarding a comprehensive regulatory regime for medical marijuana in the state of California and this is something that
659	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	-R4HGT4UbOs	1289	1308	This is not unique as areas in my own south and west Los Angeles base district have shared a feeling of being subordinated in important public conversations from time to time. Rick was unique in being able to bridge the communication analogy gaps between regions of Los Angeles
660	Garcia	Eduardo	38	ejG5Ru6MX_o	1595	1611	Thank you, Senator. If there aren't any other questions or comments, I know there is a motion and a second. I just wanted to close by thanking you for bringing this bill forward. It looks like what we're trying to do is get far more specific than we have in the past in preparing a work force.
661	Weber	Shirley	44	E2qxwCiVZM4	1013	1046	And so please refer to your handout. First, to eliminate the unintended new term, unsatisfactory conduct on page four of the bill. Line 27, insert unprofessional before conduct. Second, a related technical clarification regarding participation in par and dismissal process on page four of the bill, line 38, after the reference to section 44673. Insert the clause, and quote, the errating, the rating exclusively relates to the areas of teaching methods or instruction.
662	Pan	Richard	96	hnhklV-igrA	1876	1897	But the continuing production of those vaccines do not involve aborted fetal cells I believe. There was quote from the Pope who I believe is the leader of the Catholic Church, saying that he believes and supports vaccination. We can certainly try to find the quote for you, I don't have it at hand.
663	Hueso	Ben	48	CKAXbjP6mGQ	1346	1372	Less and less we're talking about how important it is to save our planet and how human activity is creating such a burden on the world's population. Currently in China in the guangdong province there are acres, hundreds of acres and thousands of acres of land are being removed from the production of rice.
664	Baker	Catharine	74	qH7o9sr6oMM	761	775	So we do need to scrutinize that carefully and understand that it is a feasibility study to see the case be made because these are funds that can potentially go to good uses for getting doctors in our communities in the Central Valley and elsewhere in California. Thank you.
665	Mitchell	Holly	64	2afEpcU9CME	786	815	What this bill does is expand current law to not only include the direct victim of a crime, but a young person who was a witness of a violent or sex crime. Again, it will allow them to testify via closed circuit television. The legislation was inspired by a court case from Fresno where a child of a father who was murdered in front of her was forced to take the witness stand face-to-face against the man who murdered her father
666	Hancock	Loni	98	zaVlsvC4ABg	70	91	And do we also have data on How many eligible voters actually register? That you get into who's eligible. If only half of them actually register, and then only 5% of those actually vote, you're getting a very.
667	McCarty	Kevin	22	d0K-gu5-iM8	36	49	I know there's a packed house here and outside, so we're going to try to make sure that we do public comment after each item, not the very end, to try to accommodate people who are here specifically on a few items.
668	Gomez	Jimmy	80	QXW5aikdMmE	431	451	AB 1071, Atkins, supplemental environmental projects, due pass. A roll call. AB 1094, Williams, energy usage, plug-in equipment. Hold in committee. AB 1095, E. Garcia, Salton Sea restoration, do pass with amendments to delete the contents of the bill and said require the natural resource agency to report to the legislature by March 31, 2016 on that.
669	Bloom	Richard	2	t0rNuwc0CtA	1075	1089	From my perspective, the correct type of action to be taken is to come back and say we think there's a better way. Would you approve this? But that never happened.
670	Bonilla	Susan	3	RK37B-MMwt0	2	23	Okay. They're all coming. Oh. They were in the elevator together. My goodness. No. There was a party. You all had breakfast and I wasn't invited. And neither was Jim. All right.
671	Gomez	Jimmy	80	QXW5aikdMmE	419	431	AB 1061, Gallagher, Sacramento and San Joaquin drainage district due pass with amendment to delete property sales provision. A roll call. AB 1062, Bonta, Environmental Justice Small Grant Program, due pass. A roll call.
672	Holden	Chris	78	AAng3WP84Ks	341	356	Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I move unanimous consent to suspend Assembly Rule 118 and allow Assemblymembers Dodd, Frazier and Melendez to have guests and photographers on the floor today.
673	Gray	Adam	27	DEi_8R7XWOE	1757	1780	In fact, maybe, could I get Mr. Manning up for a question? I'm curious what on behalf of what you would offer as a recharge option in the absence, you know, you mentioned and I think you raised some legitimate concerns about pushing more water through the system.
674	Nguyen	Janet	65	6Q9j6EYWwEw	1649	1670	These seniors have come to me and have cried to me, they haven't had an eyeglass for a year. Yes, $100 to each of us here is not a lot, but it's a lot to seniors who only getting $600 a month, that's a lot of money to a lot of people.
675	Gray	Adam	27	DEi_8R7XWOE	1780	1794	But absent recharge irrigation and particularly flood irrigation is the best recharge option happening on a regular basis. And of course, as we restrict those surface flows, we don't have irrigation.
676	Atkins	Toni	110	SQEMna8rhH0	824	850	Thank you, Mr. Vice Chairman. I would say in response to some of the comments, and I'm happy to answer any questions or take comments from your members. I think were all sort in an agreement that this is an important way to approach addressing recidivism and providing significant resources that are necessary to make someone successful.
677	Runner	Sharon	4656	E7fL6Rs-58o	1015	1055	So I am concerned about it's not means tested. I don't think everybody needs to have another full grade before kindergarten. One kindergarten isn't even mandatory. I believe that we need to let the parents decide that in issues where it's needed. There is already provided preschool programs both state and federal Head Start and others that will meet the needs of those who cannot afford their children in preschool.
678	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	FqvrEDpEtaY	1440	1474	I mean, here we are seeing a number of and we'll get into that our next sessions, next program is going to be on the safety aspects of train travel, but the fact that really, if we can get trains at the right time, if they can be comfortable and reliable and they move efficiently and in a timely fashion, I think that there's tremendous opportunity here in all these corridors and I want to thank you for your efforts in, you know, working together.
679	Hertzberg	Robert	99	a6D1KFF96cc	1513	1529	Yeah, yeah, yeah. I was thinking about how you'd apply it, a little bit. I mean, obviously, in that situation the law is pretty clear. But in other situations where you say, well I was discriminated against and then you come up after the fact, if they didn't make that, that point clear. I'm just trying to think of it.
680	Hertzberg	Robert	99	yhx1NvxzAgA	1992	2015	The only question here and the final point is the uniqueness of this issue in terms of it is somewhat challenging in terms of how we do it. But what grapples my mind in all of this stuff is we tend often to limit our view in the Legislature to whatever the thing of the moment is. It worries me a little bit.
681	Nguyen	Janet	65	rXdeWNKFzAk	1079	1097	Okay, sorry, thank you, thank Mr. Chairman. What can we do? I mean I know the federal government is quite big. What can we do to try to try to move them a little bit? Because I mean, what I concerned, I am concerned with the backlog, but even just knowing what these services are, have we been able to get all of our veterans into these services?
682	Garcia	Cristina	112	ejG5Ru6MX_o	426	443	We need to send a message, if we're going to be political economic partners with our neighboring countries, we need to hold them accountable. California is an economic powerhouse. We are in a position to insist that the Mexican government begin to seriously address the injustices they have long been associated with.
683	Gomez	Jimmy	80	kGJrWtDlyMM	1697	1708	Thank you, Mr. Cooper and Mr. Bigelow. Any other questions or comments from the committee members? Seeing none. We are going to have a Republican role call on this bill.
684	Huff	Bob	105	5cbDr55Nnpw	1176	1187	While California lawmakers take the initiative to address many of the difficulties undocumented immigrants face, these complex issues cannot be solved without the help from Congress and the President.
685	Lara	Ricardo	107	BMNgYibzIuk	373	391	The frustrating part here is that every time we try to ask for more information, everything, the one response we keep on getting back is it's premature. We'll wait for the LCFF to work its way up, but what you just explained to me can also work with what our members in the Assembly are asking for.
686	Allen	Benjamin	70	QnBcTK-as8k	134	154	And of course, it's taken way too long, but, we're now finally close to that, that important compilation. Under this pending system, county election officials must offer registration and concurrent provisional balloting to any qualified electorate to the official's permanent office during the two weeks after the close of registration through election day.
687	Quirk	Bill	23	1fxZCVj9XoA	604	619	So I'm very much in favor of this going forward. I think Mr. Lackey's concern... dealing with the industry... you're going to pledge to work with them going forward. So I enthusiastically recommend an aye vote.
688	De Leon	Kevin	102	uBO-fu4onZs	533	550	Okay, It's gotten real small. Okay. With that welcome your nomination before this committee is that of standing member of the CalSTRS program here in California. Why don't you start?
689	Williams	Das	12	1O51OMdLA-4	1197	1215	even with our oversight authority as the state Legislature, many of these institutions waited till the last possible moment 'til we were actually on their campus or three minutes before the hearing began to provide any information as to the adjudication outcomes for
690	Williams	Das	12	1O51OMdLA-4	1181	1197	up to expulsion if a student is found responsible for campus sexual assault. The bill would also require campuses to publicly report and disclose campus adjudication outcomes for sexual assault offenses. Members this is a very important part of the bill because
691	Wood	Jim	72	MO4QFekCxFk	500	522	Great, well thank you to Mr. Bloom, and for bringing the bill forward. And thank you to the proponents and the opponents. Ironically today in the mail, in the, in my email, I received a an article through the American Dental Association from the Journal of Public Health Dentistry a study of 3,773 adults.
692	Wolk	Lois	94	xG-KiREcweY	524	557	Alright, 2 to 1 that is approved. Alright, let's move on to the Department of Toxic Substances Control another problem area that we have a very complicated and thorough set of proposals on page 21 and 22. Yeah, definitely. This is a big one.
693	Gray	Adam	27	FapiTOGMI3c	656	682	Mr. Chair, committee members, I just wanted to support Senator Pavley's bill today. As you all know, you saw my bill earlier in the year, AB 1142, dealing with the same subject area. My first involvement with this issue of course was as JLAC chair in the previous session, looking into the fee and the expenditures around the fee.
694	Berryhill	Tom	54	SBp6YDSI70I	676	688	we've got today had we had that money actually not been borrowed, and actually had been put to what we said it was going to, so I would appreciate it if you followed up on that, thank you.
695	Alejo	Luis	9	JG7mRMz5Gp8	86	102	There's about 150 superintendents out of 600 school districts earn more in their annual salaries than our current Governor, Jerry Brown. 71% of superintendents in the states largest districts, and 45% percent of all superintendents left their jobs between 2006 and 2009.
696	De Leon	Kevin	102	45V7xUBPIec	498	522	Is it of your belief, and I surely don't want to put anything in your heads, that perhaps the culture, I don't know about the present, current culture, but the culture of the past ceded tremendous amount of power to staff where the vast majority of the decision making was taking place by staff?
697	Bonta	Rob	85	gmSplS1IxCE	673	685	I'm hopeful that our colleagues will see the wisdom of the bill and the importance of the joint, the collaborative effort, not joint, effort and vote in support the bill.
698	Hernandez	Ed	103	JM1ztwrhmks	1689	1696	I mean I'm just ... These are just some of my concerns and some of the questions that I have for you. But is there any other comments or questions?
699	Liu	Carol	63	RORFPzwiDnU	1664	1680	Okay, well members that's it for this morning, next week we have 20, oh I'm sorry we'll add, we'll open the roll, I'm sorry. Okay, we'll open the roll for absent members, thank you. We'll call the roll for absent members, okay.
700	Hernandez	Ed	103	JM1ztwrhmks	1663	1673	But more important, I'm responding to the fact that this is going to be a huge cost to the general fund and the State of California when we have limited amount of dollars that are going to go into the health care system.
701	Wilk	Scott	19	dKyb6eNIcTg	1511	1523	I'm going to sit in the Mr. Ridley-Thomas lucky Chair. See if this streak continues. Anyway, thank you, Mr. Chair and Members. Today, I present to you AB 1398.
702	Wieckowski	Bob	55	eGYOhkRkhDU	92	112	and hear the assembly's environmental safety and toxic material committees four bills, AB273 through 276, which makes statutory reforms to DTSC's cost recovery process. And then we'll proceed with the rest of the file.
703	Wieckowski	Bob	55	eGYOhkRkhDU	77	92	Today's hearing revisits that discussion to get a progress report on the department's efforts on the cost recovery. After we have the oversight hearing, we will convene the legislative hearings, and we will start with a special order of business,
704	Bonta	Rob	85	cVvEnGhVv_c	203	230	It's really important that we focus not on monoliths, but on specific disaggregated data points that can really help inform the work and the action that we have. And if we take the API community as an example, there are more than 23 distinct communities within the Asian-American population and 19 within the native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander population.
705	Nguyen	Janet	65	4RPfdYzqQQc	836	858	So I again appreciate SB 670 in which it addresses access to childcare and removes some of the barriers that families are facing. I am also very appreciative of the fact that this bill provides incentives for employers to start child-care programs and also raises the percentage of dependent care credit that parents can receive
706	Bloom	Richard	2	Q7LdbTCujmM	1716	1739	Thank you. Ms. Nichols, we've spent a good deal of time talking about how we define that disadvantaged communities and the screening methodology that that's out there, but can you talk a little bit about how we define benefit to disadvantaged communities? How are we defining what constitutes a benefit?
707	Rendon	Anthony	120	zxWUxjOp--I	360	374	I just want to remind all of our panelists that a lot of you, and a lot us, so we'll probably ask a lot of questions. So if you can limit your testimony to 10 minutes that would be great, thank you.
708	Thurmond	Tony	4	A6ledtIW6-Y	410	424	But I want all the advocates who've come here today to know we appreciate how hard you work in the community and at the regional center and we disagree with any effort to try and say that one side of the community deserves funding and the other one does not.
709	Pan	Richard	96	89bDX7qtwgo	124	144	But I actually think that many of the people who are remaining fee-for-service are actually either greater specialties or underserved areas because the larger populations are easier to do managed care.
710	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	yVd5ZErYEYE	1187	1197	Mr. Julio, I need you to wrap up. This is really great stuff and I can feel your passion, but I've got to move you along. Can you wrap up please?
711	Nguyen	Janet	65	jWp79DKV-DI	1070	1088	And again we're also looking I know that before I left there was other talks about different types to add to that. Even in having collaborative courts inside a jail. So the transport cost of inmates to and from jail, and also saves a lot of time as well as maybe looking at something inside the jail.
712	Nguyen	Janet	65	fDaysw_EoYM	701	725	Thank you Mr President and colleagues for the opportunity to speak today and for allowing me to introduce individuals that have come to the state capital in recognition of the black April memorial month. Today unfortunately though, I actually requested to be able to display and be with me next to me was the former south Vietnam flag; it was denied.
713	Calderon	Ian Charles	115	VixXoFAwUIs	441	453	Currently we're operating under a complaint based oversight system that is reactive to issues in our facilities instead of being proactive to prevent and stop these issues before they become deadly.
714	Thurmond	Tony	4	89bDX7qtwgo	929	942	We'll be looking for regular updates. I know that the Chair is interested and Miss Waldron, who talked about her constituents who have to travel upwards of an hour, is also interested. So, we'll be looking for regular updates on how we get those numbers up. Thank you.
715	Melendez	Melissa	41	iQQbLXy8ddc	1111	1484	All righty, that concludes our agenda for today, but I know, but we're not adjourning yet because we have votes that need to be added on and of course, we're waiting for the illustrious Chairman Clark to come back, so we're on hold. Thank you. Okay, we will do add ons now while we're waiting for the chairman to come back, Madam Secretary.
716	Bonta	Rob	85	eOaXlPRJTVY	1024	1042	So we understand that there's an open question. Our bill is, is silent on that issue right now. We feel that it would be a stronger bill if that silence was filled with content and substance, with input from all the stakeholders. So I think the concerns that were raised by the providers here today, are concerns that I have about the bill also.
717	Bonta	Rob	85	tf_1MHXwKaY	185	199	Those extremes, so to speak, were taken off the table, and what we were left with in the middle, were 2 approaches. One, an approach using the Medicare database, which is public and transparent, everybody knows what it is. There is no doubts about what it is.
718	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	jjB76hKrhNA	1202	1217	Thank you Senator, and I know that I speak on behalf of all the members of his body and also of this institution in extending condolences to her family, as well. Senator Morrell.
719	Pan	Richard	96	fNOTPzEYh_E	1209	1229	But I think, and that maybe we'll not try to decrease the amount of money, we have to trim off to do that, by getting a better return. That's fine, let's say that, but let's also be honest that you're taking on more risk. Okay, these are not risk less investments, okay?
720	Pan	Richard	96	fNOTPzEYh_E	1229	1245	Treasury bonds, Borrowing, Congress acting up again, are pretty low risk. Mutual funds, and there are a variety of mutual funds. I mean basically this is at least from my understanding says mutual funds subject to registration.
721	Hueso	Ben	48	knCQGn-OW5c	693	715	Do you work in areas of border wait time reduction, making investments and border wait time reduction? How do you know that there are loans that have been made to projects that accomplish binational trade and deal with the behemoth challenges in crossing the border between the two countries.
722	Berryhill	Tom	54	cZiDd6UFemc	551	567	So I'll certainly be backing this compact as we move forward and wish you the best of luck. With that, any favorable comments? We would be more than anxious to hear from you.
723	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	kj6ztr1oPBg	1412	1424	Well that depends. If you would rather buy something that's made in Germany versus made in the USA maybe that would make a difference. But under, I appreciate your, appreciate the analogy and the attempt that you're trying to make.
724	Bloom	Richard	2	c9Ojvyv2LI0	152	176	to provide additional safeguards to the expansion of oil imports by rail coming to California. And it cannot be taken lightly that oil by rail increased 506%, 506%, to 6.3 million barrels from 2012 to 2013. And I got to get this stat fact checked.
725	Pan	Richard	96	fNOTPzEYh_E	1245	1264	So there is no restriction on the type of mutual funds and there's a whole variety of mutual funds out there. You can get sector funds which are really high risk. You can go broad base S&P 500 Index Funds probably a little less, but still I presume won't get into private equity, which isn't in this.
726	Harper	Matthew	14	Hc7WoMlUJqU	1029	1049	So you're saying that you would decrease the existing employees' wage, or. If a company is gonna be going out of business because the economy is down. And the only way you can keep your, your keep your business afloat is by paying people less. Are you saying that, that can't be done under this?
727	Gomez	Jimmy	80	11yyICoQ5m8	1689	1703	So the folks that are getting topped off are still going to have to pay 35% of that paid family leave. They're still going to have to cover a good chunk of that employee's time off.
728	Runner	Sharon	4656	4l5FjBTBUZQ	1251	1271	Thank you Mr. President. As a co-author of this measure I rise today to speak and support. Some studies indicate 25% of women who report rape indicate drugs were a contributing factor. The use of date rape drugs in sexual assaults is a particularly
729	Bonta	Rob	85	gmSplS1IxCE	1266	1282	Thank you, colleagues, for your input and your thoughtful comments on this important bill for the future the state of California. I just want to touch on two of the last comments that were made by some of my colleagues. my colleague from Elk Grove included.
730	Runner	Sharon	4656	4l5FjBTBUZQ	1271	1296	despicable act. In fact committing sexual assault with the use of date rape drugs can result in a life sentence. However, we should not wait for a rape to occur to impose that penalty for using these drugs. Possession with intent is enough. I want to thank the author for bringing this bill forward and also thank Assemblyman Tom Lackey
731	Weber	Shirley	44	jRDlxywi7uQ	0	30	We don't have a quorum yet I don't believe. We don't have a quorum yet. We'll ask the sergeants to please call the Members of the Committee, so that we can establish a quorum for this particular meeting today. This is the Assembly's 2nd Extraordinary Session Finance Committee of September 4th, 2015.
732	Leno	Mark	60	SK-C_51Liio	1234	1255	I know your district so well that if you had a crisis, and your mayor was here, and your entire board of supervisors, and city council, and everyone unanimously was in support of what you were trying to do, that I would suggest I knew better how to deal with the most important crisis in your city.
733	Hueso	Ben	48	zgKkKMVKglc	74	93	The proposed facility would provide an off street location in the downtown San Diego area, where transit vehicles could be parked for short periods between runs to establish a central location for driver breaks, to free up on-street parking spaces and preserve existing spaces.
734	Frazier	Jim	114	KbV7aq9eFHo	1381	1397	And I appreciate that. And you look at all the years that the military has paid to train these individuals then have to start over with their GI Bill going through you know these here, whatever and it's kind of redundant and is double.
735	Hueso	Ben	48	zgKkKMVKglc	49	74	SB 374 is a district measure that would simply bring our SANDAG or our Association of governments into alignment with other transit development agencies by clarifying its ability to utilize a design built project delivery method to projects adjacent or functionally related to transit facilities.
736	Wolk	Lois	94	CW6mZhhMcnU	679	690	Thank you madam chair and members. I will accept the committee amendment which gives DWR a year to promulgate the rules instead of six months as listed in the current language. As an author's amendment.
737	Hertzberg	Robert	99	LW2wm2tITKQ	1468	1484	That's it, did Lara vote on this one? [Yes.] Okay good. So all we're waiting for is Mullin who's got about sixty seconds. Because Senator Pavley has to leave, and as do others. He was here before, I know, waiting.
738	Pavley	Fran	104	Q93W3yN07bU	174	188	I think with the, all the, appropriate state agencies engaged now in making sure the wording in the language and the privileged information is taken care of, addressed, in this bill, I think we're on the right track.
739	Beall	Jim	92	ch_qINsbUNA	650	677	Because I think that's a major concern that I have and I want to focus our municipalities and counties on alternatives to criminalizing homelessness. It's a dead-end street, literally, and a fiscal disaster if we continue to criminalize homeless people.
740	Eggman	Susan Talamantes	73	DgVvXUz7n-U	83	105	This bill requires that in order to qualify, a person must have a terminal illness. It requires that the request be voluntary, and only the qualifying person may request the drug. They have to request the medication three times. One time in writing, 15 days after the first verbal request,
741	De Leon	Kevin	102	uBO-fu4onZs	1851	1871	Okay colleagues, we're gonna continue to work the file. We're gonna do the file item number 3 sub D and E. We, as you see, 4 has been pulled. For today we're gonna continue with five, six, seven, eight and nine. So file item three through nine, minus four. Can I get a motion?
742	Allen	Travis	43	4tou47dRNaA	839	853	Thank you Miss Gonzalez. Seeing no discussion on the debate side, clerk will open the roll. All members vote who desire to vote, all members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. The clerk will close the role and tie the vote.
743	Alejo	Luis	9	kJUQLNRw8o8	84	99	For this reason this bill has attracted 16 co-authors from both parties and both houses of legislature including several members of this committee. The goal of AB 1390 is to clarify court procedures that apply to comprehensive groundwater adjudications, to reduce the time and improve the efficiency of the process, thus reducing costs.
744	Alejo	Luis	9	kJUQLNRw8o8	73	84	When the governor signed the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act, or SGMA last year, there was an interest in streamlining the adjudication process. Every 13 annual work in conjunction with SGMA to do just that.
745	Gatto	Mike	46	Sai1lZPOK9g	834	858	So the bill before you is Assembly Bill 83, which has to deal with the way in which businesses handle certain kinds of personal information. There has certainly been a lot of impotis in the public right now to have their governments and have their elected representatives come up with some sorts of standards that the legislature can put into place.
746	Lara	Ricardo	107	ptq5V1Fu0ok	1391	1411	Next item is AB 833, individual child care subsidy plan, do pass to the Senate Floor we will substitute the role from AB 361 that bill is approved a unanimous vote of 7-0.
747	Lackey	Tom	10	ErZVzyFotGs	1408	1434	I don't really have a question per se. I just welcome this discussion. I think it's an important one, especially when right now, the trust and the partnership between law enforcement and their community seems to be under a pretty severe strain. I would like to say that, as far as my background, back in the 1980s.
748	Lara	Ricardo	107	ptq5V1Fu0ok	1459	1473	AB 1518 Medical waiver. Do pass as amended to only require the department to apply for 5,000 additional waiver slots. We will substitute the role from AB 361, that bill is approved on a unanimous vote of seven to zero.
749	Moorlach	John	4657	Ouu9P0a4sNE	1801	1819	Okay so if I. Walter Ehlers was a close friend of mine a Medal of Honor recipient, passed away recently. Your report is one that, that begs for all intensive attachments, so just real quick, quick questions. The first is on page one, just for my own benefit.
750	Eggman	Susan Talamantes	73	O1x83dZ-ZdA	224	251	I am here today, and I wanted to start by saying we're accepting the Committee amendments a,c,d, and e. Those amendments are found in the analysis and there's been conversation and some media about amendments that we're working on with CMA and that continues to be a work in progress. We have been having very productive meetings with them throughout this entire process.
751	Bonta	Rob	85	JfU4ybXUoBc	2081	2090	Assemblymember Gipson, I think at the beginning of your presentation, you made a reference to amendments, and I just want to clarify that you have, you made a commitment to working on policy comments in the staff analysis.
752	McCarty	Kevin	22	ZcJSZ4qEe4Y	656	671	Sure. Well, the state preschool program is primarily three and four year olds. Certainly zero through five is a piece thats we're focusing on extensively in the subcommittee process in the budgets, and I support making sure we have programs for those that cohort as well.
753	Weber	Shirley	44	9NVb2cnRnt4	1920	1929	And there is a proposal at this point to deal with the issue and so I'm going to encourage Mr. Alejo to work with Mr. Bloom in this because there will be a proposal coming forward.
754	Lara	Ricardo	107	MvS4M4JYJ2g	307	328	It is estimated that approximately 10 million Californians are immigrants. 6.5 million are either naturalized or eligible, eligible to naturalize. And more than 2.6 million are aspiring citizens, not yet realized due to, not yet realized due to our broken immigration system.
755	Wood	Jim	72	jKVkIx_af_k	1545	1558	As written, my bill also establishes a program to help law enforcement properly identify medical marijuana plants. In its current form, the bill calls for a $50 per plant fee to the cultivator for a tagging program with the unique identifier.
756	Gaines	Ted	24	zKRXexcG8LM	475	488	Thank you, Senator Beall. Members, any debate or discussion? Seeing none, members would there be any objection to the unanimous roll call? Seeing none, aye's - 40, no's - 0, measure passes.
757	De Leon	Kevin	102	w3XqiN30Dys	1714	1744	Whether it's our current state park system right now and the backload if you will with regard to maintenance issues. There's a whole variety of really good well-meaning and intentioned projects. We've got to keep in mind too what the overall number will look like. What's going to resonate with the voters, specifically. And we want to be careful that it doesn't end up becoming a Christmas tree if you will.
758	Brown	Cheryl	13	pyW7Y47fazc	404	432	I additionally supported Mr. Medina's legislation, and I believe that we need to look deeply and see how we can improve public institutions, but also don't put these institutions out of business because they do have a place in our society. So I don't wanna take any more time. I just want us to get on with the discussion, thank you.
759	Morrell	Mike	51	uymj8kL8SYs	1812	1832	Revenues are up. According to our Governor things are looking good. We should take that and get rid of it now, so I respectfully ask for your aye vote to make sure our citizens in those mountain areas are being being treated fairly. Thank you.
760	Pavley	Fran	104	yzBzen_uFsA	1219	1244	 I just wanted to ask you about that. We have a section on short-lived pollutants. My understanding, on definition, black carbon is a short-lived pollutant, if that's not something that you agree with, we can certainly work out the words or has that been settled? Oh, then good. Technical amendments, good. Thank you.
761	Wood	Jim	72	ASNmI2rHU9I	1593	1607	More recent surveys show 30 to 40% wouldn't choose their profession again. And, if you're, if you're asking how would they recommend this to, to their children? 90% of doctors wouldn't recommend medicine to their children.
762	Hill	Jerry	66	R5jZe-4pYBI	299	318	We talked about the number of areas that have this challenge. That's, to me, what the issue is related to this. It would be fine without that, but now we're putting a burden, now, on those nurse-midwives, who we want to make sure have an opportunity at some point in time in those rural communities to be able to do it, so that's what the amendment says we'll just add an exemption.
763	Cooley	Ken	45	fB7TsGCipRU	547	556	On the issue of what agency, I do think that there's an issue here of what is the way, what is the best way to set up an accountable structure.
764	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	OIbMOKdbCjk	383	406	And she was presient in those days. And so we have heard comments about the number of women that we've had in this august body. From a high of 42, now presently at 30. And it is incumbent upon us to recognize that there are young people up in the gallery and they need to see that there are both men and women here. Because women hold up half the sky.
765	Brown	Cheryl	13	YyQcVb02jrM	1398	1423	However, when their houses are still sitting there, it's just investors have come in and purchased those houses. I'm not against anybody's business because that's pretty much what I'm about. However, that business model has created a huge problem. Now the rents are going up and people don't have jobs locally.
766	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	ZM99l_dNJfs	1246	1267	OK, and the task force that were mentioned by other speakers with the chief justice and trying to invite the superintendent of public instruction, I don't know they already have a combined test because I think I heard that-- is the secretary of state formally a part of those entities or does he have his own,
767	Monning	Bill	25	r81aKKdk2dA	344	371	And again, I'm the first to acknowledge the good faith of the COHS in my district. They do tremendous work, as I said in my opening, but I represent the consumers, not just the plans. I represent the patients. And the example, again, of the review, and this was pointed out by the supporters, that's not the singular issue in this bill, but it's one of the important ones.
768	Monning	Bill	25	52URYfZsNNs	73	86	I'm here today to present SB 242 which will give parents, community members, and our elected school boards a voice in community pleasing decisions that affect our schools and their surrounding communities.
769	Thurmond	Tony	4	ZUYUeUTz98c	573	597	Thank you Mr. Chair. Similar to the last speaker, the savings that were described, it just seemed to me that the good fortune of having $380 some million saved because of a higher federal drawdown was an opportunity for us to reinvest that money in a very similar program.
770	Stone	Jeff	26	V0u3hJx63PI	76	91	So, will this new waiver in any way give counties the flexibility of utilizing the full FDA arsenal of medications used to abate these addictions? And if not, what is the rationale for denying the counties that option?
771	Alejo	Luis	9	DEi_8R7XWOE	786	801	And I think we're able to address some of those concerns expressed as the bill moved forward. But I think this is one of the most important water rights procedural bills that will move trough the legislature this year. And a lot of work did go over into this bill over the interim.
772	Burke	Autumn	6	TSE2ocY_LpM	1051	1069	This amendment will offer vendors a chance to contest a negative assessment given by the state. Currently the state has 44 IT projects under development that are reported to cost more than $4 billion. By tracking vendors' quality and performance on these expansive projects, we can ensure that the state is getting what they pay for.
773	Gatto	Mike	46	D1U0Ojzunqk	1106	1124	I have very mixed feelings about this bill, despite your wonderful presentation, which really was, first rate. You know, we continue to pass these, or try to pass things that dance around the issue. But I do think Mr. Jone's comments were pretty well, or should be well taken.
774	Leno	Mark	60	mzRsScITOGM	127	145	CPUC, which is supposed to be regulating this utility, didn't have a clue either. We've seen Ttrough 65,000 emails, the kinds of secret conversations, that were ongoing. As decisions were made, with regard to the San Onofre Nuclear Plant closing.
775	De Leon	Kevin	102	fjQhThyumBs	1243	1265	Because we're already spending hundreds of millions of dollars that are not factored into overall costs of doing business in the State of California when it pertains to these emissions, whether they're carbon, CO2, or other criteria pollutants, whether it's NOx, SOx, or particulate matter, 2.5 or short-lived climate pollutants, black carbon that are emitted into the lungs of young children.
776	Gaines	Ted	24	xDQm4xTXlMg	1843	1861	Okay. Thank you, I appreciate your comment. To the degree that you've stated that you will work with the industry, I would appreciate that. I'm gonna lay off the bill. I'd like to see what the final product looks like when it arrives on the Senate floor. I think it goes to Judiciary next. So thank you.
777	Quirk	Bill	23	-O56kS7yA2Y	1422	1451	Because frankly, everybody makes mistakes, nobody's perfect, so there is a concern from the officers themselves that these things will be taken out of context. The question I have is should these things be public record? When we had an earlier hearing dealing partly with this issue LA said, no, these aren't public record.
778	Fuller	Jean	49	DDRuG0CC7zE	1757	1779	And, the only other issue that we really touched on but you convinced me that we you'll be working on that is aligning the fees for the veterans. I have a lot of veterans in my district and its a big wide open area with 5 bases so we really need you to complete that work.
779	Quirk	Bill	23	dv1TuQD9iKk	601	617	We know their implicit biases. I'm gonna do all I can in the few years I have in the legislature to get rid of these drug laws that we have and stop this war on young black and brown men of color.
780	Monning	Bill	25	HJEL7SBoV-4	1384	1405	And I've been involved in cases there, where you have to go to federal court and get relief. So that the claimants, plural, aren't facing deportation proceedings as a way to interrupt their pursuit of legal claims for damages that happened at a workplace. So thank you for bringing this story. Thank you, Madam Chair.
781	McCarty	Kevin	22	oE98JCD72Xk	1348	1365	California stepped up and defended that, I know jurisdictions, Glenn City, Sacramento signed it, an amicus brief to make sure we could support that issue. But I remember the argument saying no way. We're not gonna be able to do it. And certainly shows that by California putting down a marker, we were able to lead the way.
782	Roth	Richard	106	TPx_LL6qRDw	566	581	This is government agency to government agency. So why wouldn't the court system, the state court system for example, or the state District Attorney's office, be able to access the DMV or the Cal Vet records.
783	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	23L8yaBtAnI	1059	1079	I just want to address some of the opposition because I want to be clear about what we're doing here. This is retail establishments with over a hundred workers. This is Walmart and KMart. I don't think they're going to close down and leave the state and cause poverty if on one day of the year they have to pay their workers a little bit more. In fact, I know they won't.
784	Gaines	Beth	109	0pvN33z5LJg	258	275	Last year, I called for an audit of the former California Diabetes Program in order to insure that the funds were being spent for an appropriate purpose. The auditor, in her report, mentioned that what little funds the program received were in fact, being used appropriately.
785	Bonta	Rob	85	oSkLr6XY8ps	2398	2413	Can you help the committee maybe with an example of a mechanism that would ensure that additional rate increases expand access to services? And maybe an example of a rate increase that doesn't expand access to services?
786	Hernandez	Ed	103	tf_1MHXwKaY	763	786	Thank you we went over by about 8 seconds. Wildly in all fairness the opposition the same amount of time. Those in opposition, oh I'm sorry, those in support. Please come up and state your name and position. State your name and position please.
787	Moorlach	John	4657	qnIAoFuwUn0	1091	1111	And then write that down there was on page nine a reference to CalPERS, CALSTRS increase of 400 million. Is that just being discussed now as on the horizon or is that already being addressed, because I, I don't see that allocated in your report on page three.
788	Moorlach	John	4657	SCWpb6PxRGE	538	567	And then the state has a, a form 3548, that's already providing the credit of one half of $250, and it, it, it provides for, in the, in the, in the explanation for the form, that you, you get remove architectural communication and physical or transportation barriers that prevent a business from being accessible to or usable by individuals with disabilities.
789	Stone	Jeff	26	sFefduhHol8	251	267	You mention the inferior pay of social workers in the state, and its reflection, and what we pay these agencies and you've mentioned that it would probably take a year before they started seeing any type of relief on that?
790	Atkins	Toni	110	WR_bP6j3vkM	1356	1370	California's climate programs continue to serve as a national and an international standard for tackling climate change in a manner that maintains our economic vibrancy. But we've made great strides in meeting our first set of goals, there's more work to be done.
791	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	nJXs6pD2ors	220	237	I appreciate the opportunity, I know there's some opposition here so I wanted to make sure that you have a factual basis of what this measure aims to accomplish before you hear from them.
792	De Leon	Kevin	102	Lmzm4UU691s	42	53	Okay. We've established a quorum. Let's go to file item number one, which are the bill, the bill referrals to reference of bills to committee. Can I get a... We have a motion made by Ms. Mitchell. Madame Secretary, please call the roll.
793	Rendon	Anthony	120	7UN1Ta_jlck	101	112	AB 825 opens up the Commission to greater transparency and ensures that Commission's actions can be scrutinized through independent oversight by an Inspector General. I ask for your aye vote.
794	Leno	Mark	60	rb93slzi3ec	2097	2122	But that is indeed entirely consistent With the intent of the legislation that created 786, and you and your office have been very communicative with our office, and concerned with making sure that the original intent is respected, and you've done that very, very well. And I move the bill.
795	Quirk	Bill	23	tEhMYBdIqkE	15	41	Could you just check to make sure your microphones are working back there? Yes, good. I pushed the right buttons. So good morning, everyone. I'm calling the hearing to order. This is a place where the trains run on time. We start on time and we get finished on time. The hearing will run to 12:15 today,
796	Grove	Shannon	77	JfU4ybXUoBc	53	66	If you look at the opposition's comments that they made about having a right to choose, they're, they have a right to choose just like the Faith Community has a right to choose.
797	Weber	Shirley	44	SuJy5eE040k	1211	1230	So it's not like we're funding police departments at all. We're giving them some additional money. In the scheme of the total budget it's not a tremendous amount of money, so it's obviously not keeping these departments alive and not basically making them do their job, so I don't know what.
798	Stone	Jeff	26	uymj8kL8SYs	1691	1718	So, this is a time when the state's economics are getting better. Two-and-a-half billion dollar surpluses this year. This fee was imposed not as a augmentation of fire funds, but as a replacement of fire funds, so that less money could be used by the general fund fighting these fires.
799	Hueso	Ben	48	aPs2U6ZJJP0	102	120	That bill has enough to get out. We'll hold the roll open for absent members. If we can go back to item number one and call the absent members on AB 693. Yeah.
800	Beall	Jim	92	gN6B3iXXHo0	9	49	We have no authors here so if we, I will present my bill. Okay? So I will turn my gavel over to Senator Leyva. And this bill is SB 513. So Madame Chair, members.
801	Hernandez	Roger	37	4sq_B6zlasQ	881	900	I've introduced election reform legislation every session that I've been in the Assembly I feel strongly about the need to ensure that every citizen in every community has a voice. It is important to note that the fact that at large elections have been the subject of litigation across our state that challenges this election process as a
802	Alejo	Luis	9	eiRf682j8LU	2230	2238	We think this is the time to take this direction, but we're not the only ones. Our neighbor next door, Nevada. There was two senators that also filed a bill similar to our.
803	Fuller	Jean	49	LTEBLbyRjnQ	71	92	SB 138 clarifies that a local school district has the option to exempt high school rodeo athletes from P.E. classes. This bill idea was brought to me last year by a group of high school rodeo athletes, who serve as ambassadors for their sport and are eager to train themselves to be at the top of their potential and to excel in their sport.
804	Nielsen	Jim	68	2NCifixWHPI	0	15	If we may, we'll kinda move to the next panel. Thank you, and please do hang around. Now if we could have Thomas Gregory, James Stitt, Annamarie Ibrahim, and please come up and speak.
805	Hernandez	Ed	103	LYOrqHadQ70	112	123	Okay, so now how do I look at this? What I'm going to look at is, for me, what is the overall percentage of vaccination rates in the state of California?
806	Hueso	Ben	48	9SvrzWegmgM	532	554	In the column that pertains to you that was in the presentation provided by the Energy Commission, it shows that the distribution dealer costs and profits, which is the green bar, was about 44.2 cents of every gallon of gas-- or every-- yeah, of every gallon.
807	Pavley	Fran	104	U931SFow8w0	1902	1924	But the exposure to diesel particulate matter is a real problem with public health, particularly affecting children. One out of every five children in Fresno is asthmatic, carries an inhaler to school. And the elderly. And so thank you to Caltrans for doing their fair share on that.
808	Hertzberg	Robert	99	6r30p-6PJFA	680	706	First, the energy crisis, as I well know, related to the wholesale market manipulations and this measure is only a very small expansion of a very limited retail market. Two, to provide the necessary protections, again, public utilities code section 380 passed in 2004 provided that necessary protections to ensure the reliability of electric service in California.
809	Patterson	Jim	119	Om99VHbxcmc	379	421	The whole notion of technology that will be day after tomorrow available that we aren't even thinking about today. That nimbleness that actually gets a rate proceeding to a decision, you know, to take four years for small telephone company to me is denial. I want to courage the approach in a timely fashion, so that decisions are in fact - you give everybody the process and everybody due process, but sooner rather than later the decision needs to come down.
810	Liu	Carol	63	BhpjNxoKRfU	1128	1146	Thank you very much Mr. Chair. SB 547 is a bill that implements several recommendations from the Senate Select Committee on Aging and Long Term Care's reportmof a shattered system, refirming long term, reforming long term care in California.
811	Pavley	Fran	104	LFikd5rYakY	1347	1366	they can be an automotive engineer. They can represent science or law interests, and they appoint two public members. If you looked at the Air Resources Board and have looked at the membership over the last 15-20 years, there
812	Gatto	Mike	46	uUsytMtXn1I	607	626	It would be worded in very simple English. It would let them know that they. Why we do this, and their options, and how they can write for some more information. And then it would require them to sign to indicate that they were aware, that they had been presented with this information.
813	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	OIbMOKdbCjk	1109	1134	Ayes 34 noes 0. Those appointments are confirmed. Moving on on the daily file. File item 7, Senator Mendoza. Not at his desk. File item 8, under assembly third reading, under Assembly third reading. File item 12. Senator Hall
814	Bonilla	Susan	3	oXNKeIzrJ6c	34	48	I've got a big book here. Well, thank you so much. I know you've had a long morning. We've been watching it, avidly, from my office. Thank you, Madame Chair, and members.
815	Pan	Richard	96	1dDkNt95rgU	1101	1112	I also would say is that, yes, we want to try to get more programs for foster youth across the state and look at that and you're actually increasing funding for that and that's great.
816	Pan	Richard	96	8xCr-TQCYCc	383	400	reach out into communities where probably people don't think about civil services. Or they're not very aware of the civil service process. We can be a very complicated organization. And certainly as the Senator who represents this area where we certainly have a lot of,
817	Bonta	Rob	85	fRdlkKyIGD4	381	394	I've been working diligently with the parties to hopefully reach a consensus that satisfies all our stakeholders, and I respectfully request that this bill move forward to continue our discussions. Thank you for your consideration Mr. Chair and Senators.
818	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	kmplgTQ8GXM	130	155	Services to our veterans, services to the incarcerated population, services to the developmentally disabled. With respect, I would request an aye vote for AB 844 workplace justice, responsible management and stewardship of state facilities, and the care of our state's most vulnerable population. Thank you Mr. Speaker.
819	Bonta	Rob	85	1ZfwQ7P4YFk	136	150	We have a MediCal program status report. We have Mari Cantwell, Chief Deputy Director Department of Healthcare Services. Welcome Ms. Cantwell, thank you for being here. We really appreciate your participation and engagement.
820	Gordon	Richard	117	ZurQFkaNhto	28	43	I appreciate the committee's work on the bill, and will be taking the committee suggested amendments as listed in the analysis. California's foster youth, as you just heard, have among the worst educational outcomes of all of the state's youth.
821	Wood	Jim	72	Ew5hLn0iC0U	631	651	The reason for bringing the bill is not to circumvent state law, it's to circumvent a duplicative expensive process 5hat is essentially, in some ways, actually more comprehensive then what the state is requiring, or what the federal government is requiring.
822	Gallagher	James	108	5dSl7g7OdCI	1263	1287	With the passage of SB 400 in 1999, that led to an increase in pension formulas across the state in localities, counties, cities. But what also came with that was the ability to do retroactive increases, which increased pension liabilities in the millions across the state in different localities throughout the state.
823	Pan	Richard	96	oyj26fO_o0A	925	948	I would also make note that, I proposed to a good friend Senator Nielsen, one of the big impacts of home visitation is that often times families with young children, new families are somewhat socially isolated for a variety of different reasons, particularly their disadvantage in that we may have resources out in the community from non-profits, from government, from other sources.
824	Alejo	Luis	9	MlLd7E1te-c	174	182	I'm sorry we have some questions for you as well, we  have Darrin Polhemus, Deputy Director of the Division of Financial Assistance for the State Water Research Control Board thank you for joining us
825	Atkins	Toni	110	nhED5L0HREU	286	300	And, we do an accelerated reasonable fee increase for out-of-state students that are in line with what other universities and other states charge. Assembly Member Mark Steinorth and Assembly Member Eduardo Garcia both went to UC Riverside.
826	McGuire	Mike	93	BrmEKVFHdIk	709	730	The film has also won an above and beyond award from the women's film critics circle in 2005. Colleagues, it's my honor to be able to welcome Deborah Koons Garcia to the California State Senate. Thank you Mr President.
827	De Leon	Kevin	102	FmUMuqWK62w	1203	1253	Quite frankly, he left us a very young age at the age of 65. Age of 65, that's an incredibly young age. Whether you're Republican,  a moderate, or conservative.  Whether you're progressive or a liberal Democrat or moderate Democrat everyone universally harborred a tremendous amount of respect for this reporter and his type of journalism: tough, frank, straightforward, honest. He'll be sorely missed. He is a fixture in the City of Los Angeles and may we rise in his memory.
828	Burke	Autumn	6	s0a4gZFkKY4	547	577	Mr Chair, I appreciate the work that you and your staff have done on this bill. I really do, and I mean that very sincerely. And the debates that many of you and I have had over the last week over the corporate practice of medicine, it's merits and its effects on this bill. However I hope we will also appreciate the work that certified nurse midwives have put in over the last year, to craft language that holds true to the essential role of nurse midwives in our healthcare delivery, and the lengths we've gone to in order to address every stake holders concerns.
829	Galgiani	Cathleen	95	miQ0Fm1d12I	103	125	The district may also request a meeting with the city or county's planning agency. Similarly, when a school district is preparing its school facility needs analysis, master plan, or other long-range plans for school sites, the school district is required to no, notify the city or county's planning agency. The planning agency may also request a meeting with the school district.
830	Beall	Jim	92	pjSDFWGC8xY	1015	1047	It will take us 10, 15 years to eliminate the deficit even at the most optimistic levels of funding. Even at the most optimistic levels of funding it will take 10, 15 years, to eliminate the deficit. Now, why is that important? Well, what if we have an earthquake? What if we have a flood like we did the flash flood in the desert that knocked the bridge down. What if we have those kinds of situations?
831	Wolk	Lois	94	iRcV3DgKWQw	293	315	and it's not there from an economic standpoint anymore, so it just seems to me that we still have a serious problem we haven't got a good solution for, and I don't think people are going to be willing to spend, rate payers are looking for other things. We've spent I don't know how many hearings In the Senate and I'm certain in the Assembly as well.
832	Hertzberg	Robert	99	yhx1NvxzAgA	1973	1992	We have jurisdiction over this stuff so you can dissolve your marriage, and getting the benefit of California's laws. But we don't have laws that say if somebody hit you in the nose in Mississippi that you can then come to California and bring the person from Mississippi cuz the damage occurred in Mississippi.
833	Linder	Eric	39	PZ5qNcZ4hzo	541	561	Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would to support with I would to speak in support. In California we are currently only dealing with an epidemic of hit and run accidents and this is clearly a bill that we can move forward and support that can help find these people.
834	Pavley	Fran	104	hp2WTRF5hkg	1018	1043	Yes, Senator Hertzberg, I think the, the difference in the numbers does matter, working with the chair. I don't know what you're going to do about that, but if Senator Hueso feels strongly about that, you're going to have to figure out how to reach compromise after this committee process.
835	Olsen	Kristin	15	dpByeg5zAi8	57	76	I mean, you're ineffective or you're not and most of the research concluded that it's best, the greater number of categories the more meaningful the evaluation for teachers and the more effective you can be in aligning the professional development provided to that teacher, according to the needs of that teacher.
836	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	XG9g8L3IwGU	1948	1967	Are we going to define incidental? The goal here is not to create new litigation. It's just to give people an expectation of what is appropriate and acceptable usages of drones for recreational.
837	Wolk	Lois	94	fkvme1Ux-zg	1079	1096	Week. That year, she helped found the Women's History Project, lobbied for the Women's History Week which became the Women's History Month. Today, the National Women's History Project operates out of her Santa Rosa home. When asked about how far the project has come,
838	Cooper	Jim	21	C3fC_QKuL0U	133	153	As legislators, when we talk about tough public safety issues, such as transparency, use of deadly force, police equipment and tactics, racial profiling by policing and equitable hiring and retention policies and criminal justice procedures and police corruption.
839	Ting	Philip	30	G2qYCBsWgfA	510	534	Currently, the board has up to two years to finish an audit. We believe that taking two years to do an audit makes the audit less useful. If we shorten that timeframe into a year. We've worked very closely with the board to develop a time frame that will ensure quality, but also ensure that we can get to all counties, up and down the coast. Respectfully ask for your aye vote.
840	Leno	Mark	60	cmtzGGvG9SA	791	812	Manufacturers have to actively work to source foam filling that does not contain flame retardant chemicals and this bill would require documentation that shows when they do. Families, of course, want the information so they can buy products that not only keep their children safer, but also keep our firefighters safer.
841	Hancock	Loni	98	BIu6jaBGJCE	168	187	Mr. Chair, this bill eliminates the sunset date in a law that is working so that we can collect the water bill from landlords when the tenant has been paying the rent and the landlord has not been passing it on to the water agency.
842	Wagner	Donald	88	6e0LFFmZAnE	511	527	And we just don't need more lawsuits for something that, as I say, I don't think you've shown happens with any degree of regularity. Why not? Because as we know, quote, "It's bad business and bad for business".
843	Leno	Mark	60	cmtzGGvG9SA	812	831	The chemicals that we're talking about convert to known carcinogens when they burn and so firefighters are now dying of exponentially high rates of cancers that are specifically caused by these flame retardants when they burn.
844	Huff	Bob	105	-v1uD0LX8sQ	303	334	And yet we know that we have one of the highest unemployment rates in the nation, so we can feel real good about this, but we continue to drive jobs elsewhere when we make our electricity more expensive. Electricity is likely to increase with this higher mandate as well there's an entity called E3 study that estimates on the regular trajectory of right now with our existing policies by 2030, our electricity to be 47% higher than it is right now.
845	Cannella	Anthony	61	uBO-fu4onZs	812	823	Yes, so, the STRS, the pensions for teachers is very modest. I mean, a teacher retiring really doesn't make that much money compared to a lot of pensions and you know, the public sector, public safety most notably.
846	Wieckowski	Bob	55	5cExo6Kc7gQ	1267	1288	earn less than $20,000 or less. Most of the filers are married and, surprisingly, most of them are trying to support a family and they're working. Now despite being low income, a majority of these filers as I said hard working at the time. They just thought don't make enough money to dig themselves out of the debt that they have and
847	Lara	Ricardo	107	kyRwF6Xn7UY	1156	1171	Moving on to AB 1342, disability access, do pass as amended per author to delete one time general fund appropriation, delete fee extensions and make other technical and clarifying changes. We will substitute the rule from AB361. The bill is approved, unanimous vote, 7 to 0.
848	Daly	Tom	118	WYVxOJwtXj8	84	98	I have met with the Board Chair and Vice Chair, and I have listened carefully to the concerns of every city in the Joint Powers Authority. I've reached out to them, and offered a new set of concepts just yesterday, which I hope will allay at least some of their concerns.
849	Leno	Mark	60	JT1Tm7zEIWc	1285	1309	I don't want to suggest that I'm any more familiar with this than you are, I defer to you. But at the same time, you'd just made a comment to Senator Mitchell with regard to your intent that attorneys not be harmed, and that the courts have some discretion as to some decision making.
850	Frazier	Jim	114	q3bnYP-Cdo8	254	270	Toni comes from to us from the Assembly Arts and Entertainment Committee and we're so happy to have are here with us. Toni officially starts with us next week but has graciously agreed to join us today for our first hearing where I would mess it up if she was wasn't here. Believe me
851	Mathis	Devon	75	yFQH5D8dVds	177	203	And, what is the plan for a follow-up because as we all know anything dealing with veterans, the biggest thing is the outreach, it's not there.  You drive up and down the freeway and there's a Wounded Warrior Project billboard, but there's nothing referring to Cal Veterans, anything of those lines and you can't tell me outreach is handing a guy a book that says Cal Veteran benefits because that to me doesn't qualify.
852	Leno	Mark	60	JT1Tm7zEIWc	1335	1357	in that it says nothing in the section precludes a judge from awarding statutory, contractual, or common fund attorney fees and costs for efforts in pursuing the action on behalf of the plaintiff until July 1, 2016. Not withstanding, the affirmative defense, herein the employee, may be considered
853	Medina	Jose	81	yAgUQvRrkrQ	49	64	Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise to present AB39, which is a measure that would streamline the search warrant process. The current process to issue and obtain a search warrant has proven to be very timely and cumbersome, particularly when a search warrant is needed after hours on a holiday or weekend.
854	Wieckowski	Bob	55	m4t87KOfLMk	1382	1406	And just as a suggestion so no one is in any doubt who may not be in this room at this time, a letter to The Journal until we get around what the intent would be, until we get around to that clean up. And then additionally I just wanted to ask the author if you've had any conversations with the administration if we have any sense of how they feel sharing just a little bit of the turf over at ARB.
855	McGuire	Mike	93	J0kwSkFFMEE	1209	1231	And again, Mr. Chair, I don't want to monopolize this hearing, but I just wanted to share that concern on why this is so critical to ensure one, obviously we advance that and that we take a look at SB 148 that would actually increase, not to the peak, but increase CTE funding at least for the next three years. And thank you so much Chairman Leno and I do apologize I went on so long.
856	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	y23O4kWOpz4	364	380	And then you read the EPA report on the dereliction of this agency's responsibilities, it is just staggering and it cannot be tolerated, should not be tolerated, and by legislation in this form,
857	Baker	Catharine	74	WbiiRILqv6s	99	129	I would just noting the way the question was asked and it said we're going to do about the drone problem. I think we need to be mindful as we are engaging in this discussion and identifying what that problem is in different settings. Certainly with respect to our own backyards and wanting to have some privacy expectations in our own homes, in our own backyards, that's a different privacy problem than say law enforcement, which is looking to make sure it has technology to keep us safe and separating the technology they use from the tactics that they use.
858	Melendez	Melissa	41	8AAoooSnIWE	563	573	So I apologize, I am going to speak with them though and I think you and I can probably come up with something, but I'm going to have to just withhold my vote today until I can get some clarification.
859	Weber	Shirley	44	bencsnxh2-c	711	722	So I think that, that's something we have to respond to. I'm, I'm somewhat supportive of legal aid because legal aid is probably once again, one of our best deals in town, in terms of finding folks who have committed to working in communities.
860	Hertzberg	Robert	99	b7XHatlYhkw	1506	1520	They're gonna face $10,000 fine, cuz they're trying to do the right thing. And to me, leaving that wide open creates some challenges. I just thought of it now would have given you a heads up on it before. So I apologize for that, but it certainly bears some consideration.
861	De Leon	Kevin	102	9celf0om_Bo	1410	1441	My answer to your statement, Ms. Mitchell, is there will be more bills coming down the pipeline on the sunset issue. He is trying to get ahead of the curve is what it is too. I don't know, honestly, the analysis or the perspective of the consultant in this case with B and P as to why I think it has been custom practice when you have committee bills, that they don't count towards your, you know, your batch, per say, to move forward with your measures.
862	Chiu	David	7	BISvC49mosc	1770	1783	And with regard to AB 959, colleagues, and Mr. Chair, I appreciate your consideration of this bill which would address health and social service disparities for LGBT Californians through the collection of sexual orientation and gender identity.
863	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	npLG8Ena6eQ	1170	1206	In fact, it was my first-year in the California Assembly back in 1999. It was the first bill I co-authored. It was a bill that I co-authored in part because it is almost now 28 years since my own mother was going through her last illness. She had acute myelogenous leukemia, which is basically a death sentence.
864	Campos	Nora	76	IO307YMxf6Q	52	70	AB 1017, a bill that would work towards creating a foundation to ensure pay equity for women across the State of California. It doesn't exclude that this can apply to men too.
865	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	voBhKCc4qds	1472	1489	But, you do sign them because you assume that you're gonna have some protections, if they go back on what the expectations are, or if they violate existing labor laws. If they don??t pay you as they??re supposed to. If you don??t get the kinds of breaks that you??re supposed to get.
866	Leno	Mark	60	ZnhfCEAKzDU	892	909	Fascinating debate. We're looking at a level playing field right here. Folks who know the law well and can articulate it better than any of us up here. And I'm, as a spectator I'm enjoying it quite a bit.
867	Nielsen	Jim	68	BcOJ4WzBt0M	200	211	The Veterans Committee and Senate particularly pay attention to the role and the impact of the veterans who are women that have been discharged and are back out in the community.
868	Hernandez	Ed	103	VHKwUGu3F0g	758	784	And I'm supportive of yours, I'm gonna be supportive of the other one as well, cuz they're all worthy. But we seem to be reactive instead of strategic as far as what are we gonna do as a state, what is the best investment in tax credits to either the public and/or generate business.
869	Hertzberg	Robert	99	pnu4iUzw8JA	443	453	But let me let me ask... this is what I want to ask about... because if you look at your bill, most of your bill relates to both the RPS and to the oil... well to somewhat the RPS... the RPS piece.
870	Galgiani	Cathleen	95	MJ3yc4dhcxc	368	389	I've done a lot of work with missing persons over the last several years and I was particularly struck about a month ago when I was at an event that was held by the Association for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing and there was a little girl who was lost. And her parents as it turned out were deaf and
871	Nielsen	Jim	68	4l8d3tner_c	1398	1422	Well, let me shed a little historic light on this and Senator Alquist, and Senator Vazquencelas were always very good about doing that. I was around for the GAIN program, which proceeded CalWorks. Along with Art Agnos and John Garamendi, and a few others, and a fellow named George McMason.
872	De Leon	Kevin	102	pnu4iUzw8JA	1146	1164	So you also see the coloring, if you will, of this green economy and inclusiveness when you look at the numbers. Just recently with Mr. Robbie Hunter of the state building trades, who had an opportunity to show me data from the Central Valley.
873	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	-kB_gg_15b8	991	1008	So, I'm very much looking forward to hearing about the different ways that we are responding and preparing and hopefully we'll never need it, but if we do, the public expects that we will be there in every way humanly possible to deal with the problem.
874	Rodriguez	Freddie	69	j_cwUXYUJzk	223	241	The updated order asks carriers to locate 40% of all callers accurately to within 50 meters or of a precise dispatchable address in the next two years. That percentage is said to increase incrementally, topping out at 80% calls by 2021.
875	Dababneh	Matthew	50	zdfniIDuOwc	474	493	We will take amendments, we will work hand in hand with them. I'm committed to that, I have nothing but respect for these institutions. These are what make California great. Whether it's Stanford or USC or Pepperdine or Loyola or Loma Linda or whether it's the public universities that many of us graduated from, UCLA, UC Riverside, US Irvine, US San Diego or all the Cal State's.
876	Hill	Jerry	66	bRElxDg8F20	183	204	Also, Senate Bill 493 by Senator Hernandez, which was advanced practice pharmacists, if there was ever a change of prescription by the pharmacist, he had to communicate that with the doctor directly. Another communication that the pharmacist agreed to without any hesitation, because it was in their best interest.
877	Cannella	Anthony	61	A5ksLI96f9Q	1765	1771	Thank you, Mr. Pro Tem. We had a nice discussion yesterday. I very much enjoyed it. And as I mentioned in our meeting, I'm a licensed civil engineer and you're an architect so there's natural tension between the two.
878	Stone	Jeff	26	SQEMna8rhH0	1035	1071	Thank you, Senator Monning. Just a few issues. First of all, I applaud the effort to reduce recidivism. I think that's very important, and your emphasis on housing is very important, but different areas might have different needs, and I'm just wondering 65% of the funding that you're looking to effectuate, how it is spent through various programs that I saw in the staff report.
879	Block	Marty	59	ckveUQ3Zvdc	132	145	SB 620 will reduce application processing delays at the Board of Behavioral Sciences and simplify the requirements for applicants to ensure that our trained counseling professionals can be licensed quickly and start working.
880	Dababneh	Matthew	50	22ufHgqGK-A	785	806	I have a question for each side.  For the gentleman from Taxi Worker's Alliance can you provide us with a copy that study he said came from I think UC Institute of something and also when you ...you can use the fact that only 6% of people, said the survey is that a scientific study, you know, was that an actual,
881	De Leon	Kevin	102	NPktHkkmjlQ	186	206	we doubled the number of days, working in a collaborative fashion with business, from 10 days we doubled it to 20 days of the final decision, they must acquire a wage bond of $150,000. If the business fails to comply, the employer is subject to a stop order and a lien at the Labor Commissioner's discretion.
882	Burke	Autumn	6	R5jZe-4pYBI	2052	2061	But for now, I would ask very much and hopefully we can reach an agreement in 2016. So I will ask that you make this a two-year bill, sir.
883	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	jjB76hKrhNA	1543	1562	And, exist right here in the great State of California This awareness day started in 2007, when the US Senate, the United States Senate agreed and designated January 11th as the day that we point out, as much as we can, the fact that this has become an epidemic throughout our
884	Nielsen	Jim	68	9_Ipr5dyo2o	1061	1098	are private property owners. With the passage of this bill will have yet again be vulnerable to those excesses that have not been addressed. The old saying, let sleeping dogs lie, I would say let sleeping RDAs lie for tonight. Go and look at them again next year, so be it. Tonight is not the night to resurrect the RDAs and the abuses they inflicted on so many. Urge a no vote.
885	Williams	Das	12	LXP_ciN3hzY	866	885	Japanese-American soldiers suffered nearly 10,000 casualties collectively in the war. President Obama granted recently the congressional gold medal collectively to the 100th infantry battalion and the 442nd regimental combat team in recognition of their dedicated service during World War 2.
886	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	GMJQ-TfW0Eo	1288	1303	So, they'll be a number of topics that come up that are general business conversation topics and then they get in the healthcare where it helps when you've already done the work and you've been in conversation with our offices about what it means to really get those pipelines going.
887	Hernandez	Roger	37	1E-hERPJ9VM	95	109	And to allow government to work more efficiently in delivering those resources. Here with me to speak in support of Assembly Bill 253, are Chuck Helget, Executive Director of the Veterans Services Agencies, and Anna Hasselblad,
888	Brown	Cheryl	13	W1_xO6aMQ1g	752	782	Thank you so much for the information I'm thoroughly being educated today and when I leave I'll probably understand how this credit card works. I just wanted to ask the question and you brought it up last, what if someone steals your phone? What if you go over to a terminal because you have this phone and you know maybe who you stole it from, what keeps them what keeps you safe?
889	Gatto	Mike	46	uuwAxYppIw8	438	457	Just to reflect that and that this bill is going to keep moving today in that form. We're gonna get these amendments in, we're gonna get these amendments in, and we're going to make it so that we think we will have everybody happy at some point. All right. I'm gonna give you the opportunity to close. I'm sorry. Mr. Cooper.
890	Low	Evan	11	E1_HgghcmCU	511	555	Sure, thank you very much, Senator Wieckowski. The rationale behind offering the opportunity for the sunset was to allow for this additional conversation. We completely embrace Senator Leyva's comments related to the conversation related to insurance and about full-time, part-time, whatever it might be. This is not the discussion here today, but we recognize that this is being pulled into that conversation, and so we are not deaf to this point. And so Senator Wieckowski, we have offered this as an opportunity to demonstrate good will, to say that we recognize that this is being pulled in and that's there a longer conversation at hand in this ecosystem, in this environment.
891	Cooley	Ken	45	6rjOa1qOGPA	1370	1389	Where was adopted in the December of 2004. And actually the meeting where it was adopted, there were hundreds of city officials and county officials brought together, because it is a six county region. I do know that Amador County is not a part of SACOG, but every other county, and city's representatives were part of this collaborative process.
892	Hueso	Ben	48	PLWNz_3ZqZQ	25	47	The goal of this committee is to ensure there is a focus on job creation as California works toward making our environment healthier. Research shows that clean energy and climate change policies also have a major economic component. As we seek to accomplish these goals, there's an opportunity to create jobs.
893	Wieckowski	Bob	55	EaHeR5UFXjc	468	491	Consumers who not only never received the actual notice of any lawsuit against them, but are victims of misidentification and do not owe the debt. If more than two years have passed since the judgement, the only remedy these people have is filing a brand new lawsuit in equity.
894	Nielsen	Jim	68	WfZQBhRsFGQ	80	98	And Cindy was telling me just a bit ago that this hearing is kind of one of her dreams. She devotes a lot of time volunteering, assisting veterans. And it's appropriate that she could be a part of this Committee. And an architect of some of the positive things that are going to be happening.
895	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	uaZYquORnnU	1127	1140	I wanna note that I spent two years, as was mentioned, two hard years authoring legislation that would've helped an extended producer responsibility program to help manage pharmaceutical waste.
896	Bonta	Rob	85	m48b5iZN1Uo	431	446	We have a number of policy panels that we're gonna get to but before we do, to start us off today, we wanted to have a more detailed picture painted of our context, and sort of where we've been, where we are today, and where we're headed.
897	Eggman	Susan Talamantes	73	hlltK4ejvk4	1034	1095	Christine O'Donnell came, twice she's come, three times she's come to testify, she identified herself as a republic, as a Christian, she's been over a decade in the Los Angeles Police Department and then she decided she wanted to become an attorney with her young daughter. As a single mother, her daughter sitting under her desk as she got her law degree and she fought to defend our laws, she has done everything she can to live and now she realized she will die. The last gift she wants to get her twenty one-year old daughter is to have her have a peaceful death, to have her daughter and her family gathered around her, she can take this medication and she can peacefully go aways, shed does not want the last thoughts on her twenty one-year-old daughter that she has spent her whole life protecting being proud of developing relationship with, that mother wants control in that last minute to say this is the memory I want for my baby, for my little girl.
898	Monning	Bill	25	7Nve54D7sWM	621	637	Right, so that, that presumably has operators of facilities, you've gotta be up, up to speed every day of the week. Cause that inspector could be knocking at your door tomorrow. Thank you
899	Jones	Brian	42	1ULf869aoVg	1872	1901	Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members. I also rise in support of ACR 32. In 1989, the County of San Diego had just one microbrewery and today, nearly 100. And San Diego County has become a destination worldwide for microbreweries and now with the developing market of microdistilleries as well, I believe that this is a great ACR recognizing the importance of this industry in California. Support the author and I say cheers.
900	Beall	Jim	92	6q5JSfST1YQ	136	150	Thank you, Senator. Are there witnesses in favor, speakers in favor, questions from our committee?  There's a motion on the bill. Do we have any opposition on this item? I see none. Role call.
901	Olsen	Kristin	15	jj5fwuuTvrg	1077	1088	My preference would be to, first, take a vote on the motion at hand, which I believe would be without the amendments. It didn't sound like I was hearing, otherwise, from the committee, but you're the Chair.
902	Leno	Mark	60	nhD8diu7eMA	1742	1756	You don't know when a drone is over your head. And of course, they're operated remotely as well, so they can get into all sorts of areas that helicopter's not going to. So I know this is going to get to judiciary as well, and I'll be seeing-- oh excuse me.
903	Leno	Mark	60	aa-UBR8QVvE	248	260	I'm glad to hear you consider to be a living document and then as we consider the goal of, as the Governor mentioned in his state address, reducing our petroleum use in up coming decades by 50 percent.
904	Bonilla	Susan	3	N6EhWxD1_nY	405	423	And then as I understood from your earlier testimony, that drives then a change in manufacturing in the business place to say, let's find a new better ingredient that doesn't have this effect on this percentage of the population.
905	Rodriguez	Freddie	69	UdyJhNk-vh8	1124	1141	Mr. Chair and members, first of all I would like to accept the committee amendments and would like to thank your staff for working with my staff on these amendments. AB 69 seeks to provide guidelines for developing and implementing policies and procedures for downloading the storage data from body worn-cameras.
906	Hernandez	Ed	103	GMJQ-TfW0Eo	1608	1628	So, what do they do when it becomes to the point where it's, you know, beyond the point of no return, they end up in the emergency room, the most expensive type of care that we possibly have, or they self-medicate especially within the Latino community they go to Tiajuana and they get their medications, they go to the pharmacy, they just kind of self-medicate.
907	Gipson	Mike	28	Htnfsa9QnRM	331	339	Thank you very much. I would simply just like to just close by simply saying this bill has received bipartisan support. And I respectfully ask for an aye vote.
908	Lackey	Tom	10	8g5e-OGL0_Y	657	675	Students 16 to 24 years old are able to access education and job training opportunities through this amazing organization. Youth Build has 264 local programs across the country. In addition t education, its focus is on developing leaders who are eager to rebuild their communities. The
909	Quirk	Bill	23	1fxZCVj9XoA	1105	1118	I want to say how much I appreciate you're working with the ACLU, the ACLU's hard work, and the work of our staff. And I think this is an excellent bill and I hope we get it signed into law.
910	Fuller	Jean	49	OYxOD7KdZAI	88	118	I respectfully urge your support of this resolution and the California aerospace week. I would like to introduce the host of the 2015 California aerospace week, events being held in Sacramento. Please step forward. Doctor Steven Sedoric with the American Institute of Aeronautics and aviation and Mr. Ross Ellis with the Aerospace States Association and Mr. Bill Barbato with the California Chapter of Aerospace States Association. I'm going to give them resolution, but I need a vote.
911	Weber	Shirley	44	LMUACiDfsGg	267	289	But is considering either some form of legislation, or dealing with the Admissions Review Board, or whatever it may be to look at that. Until the public schools in California, which will be a very long time, are able to offer AP courses at the same level. Because even offering one AP course does not make a lot of difference in a person's GPA when you're facing kids with 4.6,
912	Moorlach	John	4657	kj6ztr1oPBg	632	648	Thank you Madame Chair, Senator Hall I I just wanna say that I really like this suggestion, I've reviewed Senate bill 593 and it's so onerous. But this is a mature thing to do, just to provide a nice notice.
913	Moorlach	John	4657	kj6ztr1oPBg	648	668	Just be aware that there might be a provision in your lease. And I also agree with the friendly amendment being requested for changing the word to eviction to legal action against you by your landlord. I, I think that's a reasonable request, and I'm just wondering, is that something that you're open to?
914	Gomez	Jimmy	80	QXW5aikdMmE	108	145	AB 96, Atkins, importation or sale of ivory of rhinoceros horns, do pass. Little dry, little dry. Rhinos. Ivory. B roll call.  AB 142, Big Low, Mook River Study do pass. A roll call. AB 156, Parrea. AB 32, technical assistance for disadvantaged communities, do pass with amendments to add the report number, crimes contained in AB 1172. A roll call.
915	Leno	Mark	60	uk0vIxtVZmg	1336	1349	10-5. AB 115 passes to the floor on a 10-5 vote. So again colleagues thank you for all of your participation today, your focus and your concentration. I want to thank the public who participated.
916	Williams	Das	12	Om99VHbxcmc	1269	1294	I know it is challenging to operate in an age where people think that they can find a restaurant through their GPS very easily, but if they rely on that for a 9-1-1 call then a house across town might be the with the doors busted down not yours. There's some challenges. I appreciate you looking at them.
917	Nguyen	Janet	65	BifOW5Vhe4Q	400	419	While the states enjoined a new revenue windfall with $13 billion more than was expected from last year's budget was enacted, none of that new money has been used to increase the local services needed to help local government in regards to AB 109.
918	Bonta	Rob	85	h3qpDny4S5o	1463	1481	So we're going to continue to share that message with the administration but I think it's coming out loud and clear and today's another example of that. Just a couple quick Points I want to share. First I want to Thank you for saying that strengthening the Denti Cal program for children is a top priority.
919	Hueso	Ben	48	-bJq_JGSuxY	4	33	It's a busy day, so we have members of, I guess almost every committee is meeting hearing on lots and lots of bills, so it is a busy day. I did wanna announce just for the people that are here to be heard or to comment on item number nine, AB 1360, the charter party carriers bill. That bill has been pulled, it will not be heard today.
920	Hueso	Ben	48	Rj2lrXkjDIw	2564	2577	And I think it will be helped by the 50% RPS. So I am recommending-- yes, we can get a motion to move the bill.  You want to close?
921	Hill	Jerry	66	dPyMSgDnNQE	465	502	Eight to zero. The bill is out. We'll hold the roll open for a minute or two and thank you very much. That's it, we're done from that standpoint.
922	Lara	Ricardo	107	XKugQ-1Kx3w	404	443	In 2012, she was recognized posthumously with the highest civilian honor by earning the Civilian Medal of Freedom by President Obama. I hope you will join me and the leadership of the Legislative Women's Caucus, the Leadership of the Legislative LGBT Caucus, The Association of California Commissions on Women, 16 retired astronauts, LGBT groups and others in supporting SJR 4. With me today is Reverend Bear Ride, Sally's sister, who will share a few words, Patty Bellasalma from the National Organization of Women, and Joe Michael from Equality California to speak in support.
923	Garcia	Eduardo	38	sO4d30mS8eM	1354	1379	but displeased with the lack of investments in the early childhood education area. I'll repeat what the Chairman said, maybe the Governor proposes the budget but we approve it, and I'm hoping that at some point we will make the investments necessary to early childhood education for all the reasons that have been mentioned by the comments of our members and your witnesses.
924	Hertzberg	Robert	99	519YUTER2IM	1219	1238	And so those things kick up in the hot summer and all the places where the peakers used to be needed. And now they're not going to be needed. And so, I just don't get the logic of it. Because that's when they were kicking in, and now you got renewables that are kicking in, right? Those are clean anyway.
925	Mullin	Kevin	31	7UN1Ta_jlck	660	673	Mr. Gallagher, in your close you may also wish to address that it's the tradition of this house for members of the same party to haze fellow freshmen. Mr. Wilk, you are recognized.
926	Salas	Rudy	34	HBHfaes5iio	1871	1879	I'd like to just address that concern. This is an inter-regional route asking just to compete for inter-regional funds. And with that I respectfully ask for an aye vote.
927	Chiu	David	7	goLRzsDXvfE	254	267	The clerk will closer ...eyes 44 knows 16 ...measure passes. ...this time I like to go back to the very top of the file item seven for moments AB
928	Leno	Mark	60	hSwKpjUIVVQ	1421	1434	I have to correct myself, there was a supplemental page in State Administration. This is something near and dear to all of our hearts. The commission on the status of women and girls.
929	Hueso	Ben	48	6K6tNBJxn7k	96	113	A number of things could eliminate food from the supply and yet you don't see the drastic changes in the price in the food supply. When you do have a situation where there is a disease in a crop, the number of, let's say it happens to lemons,
930	Salas	Rudy	34	fmIaR7hDQ6w	2190	2205	Thank you for your testimony. At this time, let me go ahead and open it up for public comment, if there's any public comment. Okay, hearing and seeing none, would you like to offer a closing statement Mr. Mathis?
931	Wieckowski	Bob	55	7zfeQPMxSJ4	498	510	Yeah certainly bringing the State Water Resource Board in earlier than as we've heard from the testimony that once the decision has been made, then from DOGGR that they're going to exempt their out well.
932	Garcia	Cristina	112	WgBOQU7UIHU	576	581	So I felt like that part was changed. I will say with the Quaker group. He was not in the discussion so I don't wanna put words in his mouth. You were not in the discussions. I met with the ACLU, and the immigrant groups, and so I'm not putting words in his mouth.
933	De Leon	Kevin	102	A1UTGLmNv2E	595	626	Madam president, colleagues, good morning to each and every one of you. I am very pleased to introduce the honorable, Castaneda Magaa, the vice minister of foreign affairs for the republic of El Salvador. The vice minister probably feels very comfortable being in this chamber because as prior to joining the foreign ministry of foreign affairs, she was a legal adviser for health and environmental issues of the El Salvador Parliament.
934	Hertzberg	Robert	99	akOKQetVqu4	1377	1403	And we don't-- we could-- communities are so large. It was so impersonal that it's easy to discredit folks that are running. It's easy to diminish what their discussion is, and it's hard to then create the stickiness to get people interested and participating to understand this is really important to me. Right? So the framework of that is really-- is it-- is it a fair assumption that smaller communities actually do turn out in greater numbers, and maybe I'm wrong.
935	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	ZurQFkaNhto	609	624	AB292 specifies upon annual review of the bell schedule, if a school determines that it is currently not providing pupils with the adequate amount of time to eat, the school in consultation with the district shall identify and develop a plan to implement ways to increase a students ability to eat.
936	Chau	Ed	116	0lsNxjB7bP8	2213	2223	But if you were the passenger you know, imagine that your, your whereabouts is being tracked real time you know, by, let's say somebody else without your knowledge and consent.
937	Leno	Mark	60	XQwWN6GsS_M	1389	1412	That's the first vote, and that will be 3-0, 2-0. And then the second vote on page 17 is the status of permitting coordination and backlog reduction. And the vote on that will be 2-1? 2-0.
938	Morrell	Mike	51	A1UTGLmNv2E	1802	1829	He's also survived by his children, Phillip of Arlington, Virginia, Donald of Twentynine Palms, and his daughter Cara from Georgia and right now they have three grandchildren and he was married to his wife Marjorie, who died in 2010, and they had been married for 68 years. So members, I ask that we adjourn today in the memory of Professor Harry Japper. Thank you.
939	Maienschein	Brian	84	Y_pbsK-_qw0	1113	1128	California needs small businesses to thrive and create desperately needed jobs, as well as generate critical tax revenue year round. This measure will highlight small businesses as viable places to shop, and will be a huge incentive for consumers to turn out and support their local mom and pop stores.
940	Roth	Richard	106	cRT-vVNBfAE	2132	2153	Now you go down to sub C and it says payments provided by this section shall only be made, guess that's the operative word, from funds blah, blah, blah. So I see a distinction between a debt and a payment. And I don't understand the interpretation that indicates that the entire obligation is discretionary.
941	Gipson	Mike	28	5MdyQUos5ao	1983	1997	As the Chair of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee, it is my intent to continue to provide oversight on important topics such as access to justice again in closing ...thank everyone for your comments and our
942	Levine	Marc	8	dGzAwlRr2xI	152	171	To clarify this law, this bill defines a public subsidy as de minimis if it is both less than $25,000 and less than 1% of the total project cost, this would allow a developer if she or he chooses to seek and or accept a public subsidy to know if the Prevailing Wage Act will then cover the project.
943	Chiu	David	7	lri5mYqnVgw	310	325	I know that today's topic is going to focus a lot on transient occupancy taxes. I'm pleased that in San Francisco we were the first city to require the collection and remission of taxes by online hosting platforms to our city.
944	Leno	Mark	60	h8juzK-Kjc4	542	562	And of course, all the folks who are going to be opposing this bill today, traditionally and without exception, they did agree to a deal on this most recent. But traditionally, the line is job killer. And there will be serious consequences to the economy that raises its minimum wage.
945	Nguyen	Janet	65	QkQlxH8U7IE	1230	1248	Well, actually Madam Chair, what happened though was they were overturned, it happened on a Thursday, Friday. They were overturned on Saturday. Then on Tuesday, they were gonna have another hearing to override the override. And then it got canceled because there were, you know, lots of protesting, etc.
946	Hernandez	Ed	103	gnd2v7Ro_Uo	1771	1787	Tell me a little about the tax increment. Is it similar to the former redevelopment where it would be the new developed property and there would be the difference in the tax increment that would go to the authority and then either the cities, the counties, or the schools would get the original amount? Would it work the same way, or is it a little different?
947	Williams	Das	12	2CIDVI97Hpk	153	172	Okay. Let me just follow up on that one to Mr. Bishop. How confident are you that produced water from hydraulically fractured wells is not in class two wells under USCAPA review?
948	Pan	Richard	96	-8HmkVu5hs8	1568	1577	for either X vaccine or several vaccines for X period of time or for the rest of their life and simply write a note and that would be accepted by the school.
949	Allen	Benjamin	70	hOtjCIoL344	1566	1588	Could you give a sense of your sense of the concerns that were just raised by the folks that came in public comment. And the extent to which we can make sure their important activities are not disrupted by this seemingly neutral change in funding mechanism, that might end up jamming people up unnecessarily.
950	Hill	Jerry	66	G-_XJRcr-Yg	129	144	But the issue is I've looked through every one of the sunset reviews, and... at the end of the day, each one of them has had metrics looking for performance measurement standards that have not been achieved.
951	Hertzberg	Robert	99	hp2WTRF5hkg	330	339	But what we really have is if you think about it, right. I mean, this whole thing about short term contracts and financability, he's 100 percent correct. But that, that's again horse and buggy talk, because that was yesterday. It's all changing.
952	Nazarian	Adrin	36	WcsBFY-gdrQ	563	586	Thank you. I think we will, because what I'd like to do is actually go back to Mr. Hill and ask, why don't we go, since we have six individuals standing, why don't we have all of them speak, but then what I would like is for you to have the opportunity to respond to some of these issues that are coming up. So let's continue.
953	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	xbFtMrlj2T4	48	64	Yet, homeowners associations are still forcing their homeowners to maintain grass lawns and fining them if they are out of HOA compliance and still penalizing homeowner's who replace their lush water-intensive lawns with attractive well-designed landscaping centered around artificial grass.
954	Leno	Mark	60	bq30nlpq090	718	739	Mr. Taylor I'm sure you'll correct me if my numbers are off, but I have a clear memory going back a few years I think we cross the one hundred billion dollar threshold for general fund for the first-time in twenty twelve thirteen we were at about a hundred and three billion.
955	Gomez	Jimmy	80	rXqXXOdeL9w	704	728	We have the two bills for Senator Wuesso. Move SB 481.  We have motion by Quirk a second by Weber, this bill is out on an a role call.
956	Mitchell	Holly	64	lanFVKv-H-g	1446	1512	Fair enough? Thank you very much. Part B Human Services agenda, starting on page two of the agenda. Successor Trailer Bill, 606 Successor Fund Designation. We recommend approval of the request. It was heard at the March 26th hearing.
957	Waldron	Marie	29	7CixOREAkbE	1099	1112	How can that liability be dealt with on the side of the plan because if someone saw something, and then the next day it was updated, yet they relied on that.
958	Nielsen	Jim	68	Q9Mn4k8Lves	466	491	Mr. Chairman, Senator Beall and I have been extensively dealing with this issue for several years. A federal accrediting commission certainly appears to us and a audit that we requested that was completed confirmed the suspicions of how this agency was arbitrarily acting in California, and also in other states, but we're focused on California.
959	Baker	Catharine	74	zOcsFgJ-ERA	973	991	And if the person does pass away and the medicine is not returned, they better have that form to show that this was with consent. So I've seen your head nod that that is also one that we have the draft language, and I know we're working on but I feel are imperative.
960	Mendoza	Tony	52	2Dc5I9_7zFA	1481	1499	Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Senator Chau for working with us on this bill. I appreciate the arbiter you provided for us, and the information. You know, some of the concerns that have been brought up are still valid. I know that you're working with the opposition.
961	Pan	Richard	96	7ULUe19PTjQ	1399	1419	And in many ways what happens is that we are offering a treatment, we call it a treatment, but we don't know whether it will do anything or what the, and you don't, what you don't, and that what we don't want to do is have that interfere with people actually participating in a trial so we actually know whether this is safe, whether it's effective.
962	Hill	Jerry	66	90yWX-I7oeQ	332	348	Very good, thank you. Other witnesses in support today. Please, step forward. Thank you. Welcome. Are there other witnesses who will be testifying? If you are please come forward now and you'll be able to speak right away.
963	Hall	Isadore	1	9eA3HqZp1ws	691	711	From Assembly Member Mike Gipson's district. Please welcome Doctor Reginald Pope. Doctor Pope has been the Pastor of Bethel Missionary Baptist Church in the Watts community of Los Angeles since 1972. He was a trail blazer in helping to reduce crime during the Watts riots.
964	McCarty	Kevin	22	Y-8etEK92lU	560	579	You know, whether it's salary or, you know, benefits or just the cost of, you know, everything, you don't, you're serving a certain amount of students and certain amount of money, eventually you're going to serve less students. And so, you know, I think that it warrants the consideration to take a look at, at these programs and see what we can do to continue.
965	Bonta	Rob	85	Di5WyuYmeiA	432	453	As was discussed in the Senate Judiciary Committee, clarification is needed to address the status of students currently enrolled with an existing PBE. Amendment language clarifies that a student who had a PBE filed anywhere in California before January 1, 2016, will have their PBE stay in effect until they enroll into the next grade span.
966	Dababneh	Matthew	50	crIzv1Rza90	1663	1671	I will tell you ahead of time. I'm going to have to step out and I'll turn it to Mr. Chau about halfway through for another commitment. I look forward to hearing-- so Ms. Hepp why don't we start with you.
967	Leno	Mark	60	QKPlYzaLDfo	180	195	And then minimally, just to close, Professor Michael Wright [assumed spelling], an internationally-renowned economist at the University of California, Berkeley, stated, at the labor committee with regard to the cost of the state, and I'll just quote his words...
968	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	_wQgbHlbFh8	177	194	The proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicles has raised questions for the American Chemistry Council about potential security threats to critical infrastructure such as chemical plants, refineries and electricity-generating facilities.
969	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	nlURi31-KJY	824	841	voters of the state who want its leaders and politicians to stop interfering in personal medical decisions. Colleagues as we know abortion is a personal private and frequently complicated decision
970	Rendon	Anthony	120	ohOGzwAGjR4	1340	1351	Absolutely.  Thank you, sir. The chair's recommendation is do pass. Do I have a motion second to do pass and re-refer to natural resources? I'm sorry, I already have a, a motion from Mr. Quirk, and a second from Mr. Ting. Please take the role.
971	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	HgBIr1hupMw	629	644	So I would submit this is a preventative effort. This is an effort that will get our children to school and ready to learn at the same rates so that we don't have to spend so much time and money trying to catch them up, something which rarely happens.
972	Nielsen	Jim	68	uk0vIxtVZmg	1252	1275	Thank you. And in response, let me just offer a thought, I guess, rhetorically, you know the affection I have and the relationship with the Governor, if you would just offer to him that I'd ask him to consider saying whoa to this bill for now. He could cause it to stall a bit, and give us a little more time.
973	Beall	Jim	92	JB8xflm0bpc	851	868	And that's the issue. It's gonna take a while. It's not gonna happen overnight. This is gonna be, perhaps we can pull together a presentation to go over this in great detail if you'd like. It sounds like we should do this. So, I'd be happy to arrange that.
974	Nielsen	Jim	68	rXdeWNKFzAk	490	502	Okay, and Senator Janet Nguyen who has a marvelous life story, please look it up on the Internet. We're not telling our life stories but she sure has a story and we're so glad to have her in the Senate. Senator?
975	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	YGvsvPIzjxQ	928	948	I share those concerns, and also with Assemblymember Chavez, and we have discussed this. You know part of this is also shifting the culture within the education community that part of educating our students, sadly enough, has to be in interactions with each other.
976	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	NRrL3g0f7-g	610	628	Thank you. Any further witnesses in opposition? Seeing none, any members of the committee wish to comment? I'll comment just quickly if I could, Ms. Weber. Thank you for being a champion of early childhood education. I think studies reflect that it's very important that we get our kids into an educational setting as early as possible.
977	McCarty	Kevin	22	Jcr8DDuADtQ	229	257	Ok, we'll get on now with  the thrust of the hearing and wanted to invite up  our three segment leaders to the table over here, Brice Harris, Chancellor of California  Community Colleges, Timothy White, Chancellor of  California State University system and Janet Napolitano, President of the University of California. Good afternoon.
978	Mullin	Kevin	31	Y6LWzDb2ask	345	375	Without objection the request is granted. We will now move to announcements and adjournments in memory. Request to adjourn memory? The following members were granted prior permission to speak on an adjournment in memory. Mr. Harper you are recognized at your desk.
979	Hancock	Loni	98	Zz925hDmty8	404	426	I just wanted to point out that what we're asking for today is what every other hospital district in the state has, the ability to go out for a parcel tax. The only difference is that this district no longer owns a hospital although it funds healthcare services.
980	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	0MzTgkt-Llc	425	460	It was devastating to see this on the beaches and my colleague Assembly Member Williams has introduced AB 864 in response, which requires pipelines in environmentally sensitive areas along the coast to use the best available technology including but not limited to a system of leaked detection technology, automatic shut off valves, or remote controlled sectionalized block valves to reduce the amount of oil released in an oil spill
981	Wieckowski	Bob	55	heZIL8I4UGg	71	89	I think many in the public lose sight of the fact that this is a procedural piece of legislation and we jump in to the meat of other statutes that provide guidance for decision makers, but it's the backbone of the state's environmental body of law.
982	Liu	Carol	63	gjsHvnVIeLU	1085	1101	Thank you very much. Any other questions or comments from members? The bill has been moved. Oh, opposition. I'm sorry. Good. No oppositions? There was no opposition on file. Would you like to close?
983	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	0MzTgkt-Llc	410	425	The area impacted by the spill are areas that are such pristine coastline that we have tried so hard to preserve for our enjoyment and the enjoyment of all of the people of California
984	Leno	Mark	60	KNTNNHrdr9E	885	904	And I'll be there by your side, because I do agree with you. That if we're serious about dealing with keeping our community safer, making sure we have higher graduation rates, and keeping kids in school, that this is an important piece of it. We're going to keep making that point. Any other questions from the committee, Senator Allen.
985	Hill	Jerry	66	LgmGhqrlHbk	1095	1109	So that we can follow it and make sure that we're not getting behind the eight ball again which would present a problem. And I think that would be critical for our understanding of the success of the project in the long-term.
986	Lara	Ricardo	107	qTf-RqJKEFo	147	157	Last years' water bond set aside integrated regional water grants so that all groups or communities that have a viable approved water plan could benefit from the Prop one funding.
987	Leno	Mark	60	ZHlQISHQoPg	155	178	Short of that, they support it. It's completely fine for this gentleman to have to work 14 hours a day, seven days a week, just to make ends meet. This is not a middle class existence and he'll never get out of it, ever. And that's millions. Over a million Californians are in that situation.
988	Garcia	Eduardo	38	SaBiGmhdX4s	664	682	Prior to her appointment, Administrator Davis was CEO of the Arizona Small Business Association, and also has been a successful serial entrepreneurial, having founded and led a global event management company, an international speakers bureau, and real estate investment firm.
989	Garcia	Eduardo	38	17weTAXeEGA	796	815	So I just rise in support of AB 80 and say that this works. This works because in the City of Coachella, as I mentioned, it is working. So with that I wanted to commend the author of the bill and strongly urge everyone to respectfully vote for this measure.
990	Lara	Ricardo	107	BdgXqTHNkdY	448	467	Thank you madame president and colleagues. By now, you have heard the devastating atrocity that occurred in Ayotzinapa Mexico in September where 43 students were missing after exercising their human right of free speech. Last week, these students were officially declared dead by Mexico's Attorney General
991	Gray	Adam	27	zsI5W6gUO4I	603	619	But there's no poker available online here in California. So that's new territory for everyone. Should, how would we apply a law that both pertains to, or apply a standard that pertains to the PokerStars situation, but equally applicable to a tribe?
992	Maienschein	Brian	84	FgksiwkXKF4	1132	1150	We do have a motion in a second. The motion would be to due pass as amended to address the issue raised in comment 8C of the analysis, which will remove the provisions in the bill from the Brown Act, and instead place them in the County Sanitation District Act. And it will require the district to hold meetings anywhere in the service area of the district.
993	Hall	Isadore	1	H5As3s88-Eg	1239	1263	As it relates to the electronic devices, we've cleared that issue before, and that issue has already been taken off of the table. I've dialoged with the opposition several times before on this issue, we had this bill last year, and that issue was addressed then. The issue was also addressed now, and there is absolutely no issue. This is not a sense of expansion of gaming.
994	Mitchell	Holly	64	2MXVIex_Zeg	2075	2083	Thank you for the historical piece, just to kind of put it all in context for us, that was important. But that's why I wanted to say, now what's your recommendation? I was clear what status quo is.
995	Grove	Shannon	77	uSmu0VlTZFk	195	213	Since the governor's put this closure date in his budget process and what happens to the operating dollars devoted to the developmental centers, and the remaining nearly 1,100 disabled individuals remaining in these DCs, costing about half a million dollar a year each.
996	Beall	Jim	92	vXz2QoNROUo	6	53	Well, thank you for your presentation. Getting back to my theme of helping our most needy. When, I work with the great speaker Karen Bass, who you work with. We worked on the foster care transitional housing program and also I want to point out that was Senator Bruce Mcpherson that worked on that program also. And what we have is a program for the transitional foster youth. What we don't have, is the same kind of program for homeless youth that are not in the foster care program.
997	Frazier	Jim	114	8ZmrJUXXU4k	962	984	What would you, what kind of timeframe do you consider temporary workers? Or is that in your collective bargaining that says 30 days, 60 days, 90 days? Because I think that's imperative that we know. Because if it's an ongoing kind of a employment, where do you draw the line?
998	Lopez	Patty	89	EtJ6XaeStes	1310	1323	Thank you, mister chair members. I'm pleased to present to you AB 1112. This bill look to add in parent education to the courses to that offering to the co, regional consortium.
999	McGuire	Mike	93	LwhIfxRQ9VM	149	166	And as we know, this problem is bigger than ever. I'd like to be able to read some quick statistics. Teens in foster care are three and a half times more likely to be prescribed psychotropic medication than their peers who are not in foster care.
1000	Olsen	Kristin	15	-9yM4LrfOs0	690	718	A lot of times after being sued, business owners find themselves without enough money to make the necessary accessibility improvements at all and they're literally shutting their doors and putting people out of work. As I mentioned before, the last 12 months have been hard on small businesses in my district. One attorney, a convicted pedophile and thief from Arizona, has traveled to California for the past 13 years to sue businesses and make money off of unsuspecting business owners.
1001	Bloom	Richard	2	wr_Nl1-RdXY	2221	2237	I wanna focus on where we were last year with respect to reserve and I think where you might be going with this is that there was more either anticipated or actually received than we allocated.
1002	Monning	Bill	25	ho-PTBXT9zU	1128	1150	I think that should alsobe included in the mix. I think the concern that we've learned of is a direct correlation between prescribing and receiving economic consideration based on the rate of prescribing, which, to me, should not be part of what the State of California is participating in.
1003	Wagner	Donald	88	csda2pMKJRU	194	224	Thank you. I was, I, I wasn't gonna weigh in on this, and I thought Mr. Gallagher did a nice job, but I guess I need to, to ask the author. Excuse me. Whether she agrees with the assessment we just heard from our colleague from San Francisco, that this 90 day window will provide an incentive for these retain, these, these workers to really prove themselves, work hard, make sure they get to keep the job, I mean that's part of what's going on here, isn't it?
1004	Cooper	Jim	21	qhIgiujuUww	1255	1281	And we want to build that transparency and trust with the community. It's important. I mean we've lost it, and we need to work on it. And hopefully this is a start, and we all leave here today with a little bit more knowledge than we had before. So community members, thank you. I know it's been a long time, almost three hours. But I truly appreciate this, and in the end hopefully we get a better product. So thank you, and have a good day.
1005	Pan	Richard	96	2iFsom3zoYY	1344	1358	And there are pediatric dentists in my community I heard that from as well, so I think that speaks to how low the rates are and the associate bureaucracy. The other question is I know that as the, you know, people are looking at utilization and the finer points of utilization is really about the right care at the right time,
1006	Hancock	Loni	98	w14C8IiFUpY	883	911	Now that we know we're talking about work participation rate, I have a couple questions. If we're at 48.9% and we need to get over fifty, wouldn't it make financial sense to invest in state subsidized employment of some kind? So, that we could put a couple of percentage points of people back to work.
1007	Lara	Ricardo	107	u0-ac-4sGAg	2502	2517	Thank you. See Senator Jackson? Action Jackson. Senator Jackson, you have two items. SB 180 and SB 358. 358 does enjoy a do pass for commendation. Why don't we begin with that item?
1008	Chu	Kansen	32	td32uLu5rbg	242	279	I applaud the effort of the bay area, Bay Area Quality Management District, BAQMD for convening a Southbay holder, stakeholder group. But I felt that their group includes many of the zero waste energy development bay area restoration project and it's not really focusing on this other issue in the local very restricted area.
1009	Patterson	Jim	119	gmSplS1IxCE	848	877	They need to make sure that they obey the law. They need to make sure that they, if they're going to do what they do, they do it in a way like all other retailers in the City of Fresno and other places that try to obey the law to have clean premises, to operate with within the law, and to reduce the instances of illegal activity.
1010	Bonta	Rob	85	0pvN33z5LJg	748	762	So it's worth a try and you, you're putting more applications out there and you, and, you know, maybe you didn't think you would get it but you do. So, I mean, I'm, I'm, I know there's sort of a cost-benefit analysis and you gotta figure out how to expend your resources most wisely and you're on the ground so you know how to do that.
1011	Anderson	Joel	57	vEySB-JPx9Q	191	205	And I want to give those prisoners who have a change of heart, who are working diligently to return to society as productive citizens that stepping stone that they need, they can't get there by themselves.
1012	Gallagher	James	108	-R4HGT4UbOs	1675	1695	He was the oldest living crew member from the USS Arizona to have survived pearl harbor. As I was driving in this morning, members, I was trying to think about what is it that makes them the greatest generation and it occured to me that it is their selflessness that made them the greatest generation.
1013	Gallagher	James	108	-R4HGT4UbOs	1695	1715	So many of them, and I think you could say all of them, forwent their own self-fulfillment, put off careers, put off college, and rose to the occasion to defend our country, to stand-up to rise to the call of duty, and the cause of freedom and liberty.
1014	Hueso	Ben	48	90yWX-I7oeQ	1342	1351	We could use our own money and the State of California if in fact we are shopping at our neighborhood businesses and not using you know, buing resources from outside the state.
1015	McGuire	Mike	93	nqU0Ufhmqoo	1508	1528	So, districts tend to invest in other educational priorities. Partnership academies, which typically serve the neediest students in our schools, are the first to be on the chopping block and we know that quality CTE programs based on student outcomes work, which is why we need this investment.
1016	Allen	Benjamin	70	AGRN7-GFw2A	257	278	the departments regulations of suction dredge mining on federal lands, since the department could not legally issue permits. And the state commented, sorry the court commented that the state's laws related to suction dredge mining needed clarification. So this bill, all it does, is requires the State Water Resources Control Board to regulate the discharge.
1017	Hernandez	Roger	37	IRk3z3ZISoY	33	56	Today will be very much a Jackson dominated committee hearing. And we welcome that. So Senator Jackson you've got three bills before us today, SB 358, SB 406, and SB 579. Whichever one is your pleasure to commence with, or will you take in the file item order?
1018	Hancock	Loni	98	omDEH7LCBKo	207	259	I think maybe we've discussed this before, Senator Anderson. Part of what I think you were interested in is, do we actually know what licensed professions in California prohibit felons from holding those jobs? Because we ought to have a list of them and we ought to review them and see if some of them, I think you mentioned cosmetology one-time.That we have that in several of our women's prisons but it was in the license that you couldn't be a cosmetologist if you were a felon. The question would be, number one is that really a relevant barrier and number two, then we should change what we're teaching, right?
1019	Leyva	Connie	62	oXhYdSan_zc	949	966	I think it's unfortunate that we as a legislature are in this position. We should have corporations who are wealthier and hold more wealth than they ever have had in the history of the United States, are not providing livable wage jobs. It puts us in the position to help take care of workers.
1020	Nguyen	Janet	65	Q0YUSKbr_v0	121	136	And even in this committee, through our chair, we've hosted many informational hearings talking about providers, talking about how we expand it, how we can include more, talking about bringing, you know, whether that is increasing the rates, how do we keep some of their,
1021	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	tIl0bzr-tVs	742	762	Which is one of the most common complaints we hear about the CEQA process. Second, the Governor's Office of Planning and Research, OPR, currently operates a very limited online SEQA repository they call CEQAnet, as part of the State clearinghouse used for State level review of environmental documents.
1022	Mitchell	Holly	64	kcJR3FqGhiM	337	349	Excellent. Before we do that let's see if we have any public comment on the Trailer Bill. Any public comment. So, it's recommendation that the Trailer Bill language is accepted and it will so be. Thank you very much.
1023	Ting	Philip	30	NNzDQCiG5UU	1869	1898	He had that talent to bring together his colleagues on the labor side, but also to be able to reach out on the business side and the fact that we've been able to get so much done in the Bay Area, whether it's on minimum wage or whether it's on health care or any critical issue that we face, it was largely due in part to Bob Morales and we will miss him.
1024	Gomez	Jimmy	80	_NTagRCFfsc	2012	2029	It definitely sounds like a reasonable approach, and if the Appropriations committee and the author of this bill can come to a conclusion that's included, I'll definitely have a chance to vote on the concurrence of the bill when it gets back too. And if it passes the floor of the Senate, back to the Assembly. So.
1025	Bonta	Rob	85	Uoe2v6pAgNg	1581	1592	We've also added the department of public health to a pre-existing law that included the Department of Industrial Relations and another department and conform the categories for the department of public health to those categories.
1026	Lara	Ricardo	107	vUWGQO4sF_w	154	167	7-0, that bill is out. Thank you members. We are now gonna move to see Senator Hall here. Senator Hall has two items. My understanding is you are waiving presentation on SB 549?
1027	Bonilla	Susan	3	Y6AL-ziJQBc	745	774	Okay, I'm a believer in very clear timelines, and I think for the purposes of our sunset, I would like to get some exact dates. about when this is going to be completed and addressed. It really isn't, again, serving our workforce needs to have people taking the test and then failing it. If there's something we can be doing about that, so please report back exact dates. Schedule it.
1028	Moorlach	John	4657	6z8E6Rb3Uio	610	621	And again I'm with CPA but just a technical question.Why do we have a tax credit with nonprofits involved? How did that ever-- How-- And so now we try to do a limited partnership and--
1029	Hancock	Loni	98	bzJzCS8XdVc	762	789	But, there is a need to step in and stop abuse while the lengthy conservatorship process is decided. Until a criminal case is filed or a temporary conservatorship is in place, county agencies rely on more general protective orders that are not adapted to the unique issues of elder abuse.
1030	Cooley	Ken	45	h8s0v2JD3F8	599	616	I'm here to present my AB 1245, relating to electronic filings with the Employment Development Department of Unemployment Insurance Taxes. The bill would require that these filings happen electronically. And the implementation will be phased in over a two year period.
1031	Dahle	Brian	47	LW2wm2tITKQ	857	875	I have a now relation under the details that. We're under a timeline for this bill. It's an urgency bill, because we have funding sources ready to go and we're ready to get this bill out and to the governor so it can go through. They hospital, it's my hospital that I use. The next closest hospital-
1032	Gray	Adam	27	yasyR3bj8zo	155	174	If Internet poker was legalized and taxed properly, it might not only be in the best interest of California, but also provide the state's gaming industry with an innovative option to compliment their existing business model and with an adult population at tens of millions, California can be a leader in this new gaming frontier.
1033	Pan	Richard	96	qg64LVJvp3Q	1062	1084	So when you have a high enough immunization rate, basically, when an exposer shows up, someone shows up with the disease, it doesn't go anywhere. In fact, let's just take Disneyland, for example. This is clearly not the first time someone has shown up to Disneyland with measles. Disneyland is an internationally renowned park. People come from all over the world.
1034	Runner	Sharon	4656	_H7zvwgU_3w	331	358	We don't like it. I know there's been efforts to put it back on the ballot. But that high speed rail does not help in my community right now for keeping people in jobs that commute. And adding extra burden of gas taxes will eliminate jobs and hurt families and that's not what we're wanting to do in California.
1035	Wieckowski	Bob	55	u6fOz6AZ8WM	759	772	And, supervisor, I'm very proud of the work that I did, in Alameda county with measure BB and I know we had legislation that allows Contra Costa county to go out. So I'm familiar with and happy about that.
1036	Hernandez	Ed	103	7vLzhqaEeV8	790	805	So anyway. I appreciate all the comments that were made by all the presenters. Thank you very much. We're gonna now move on to the third agenda: Biomedical industry perspective. We're gonna have all three of the presenters come up to the dais.
1037	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	b7XHatlYhkw	1615	1634	It has to be made to either if you are or were in the assembly side to the assembly rules staff. If you are on the senate side, it has to be made to the senate rule staff. This is not just going out there and creating some kind of allegation to the public at large.
1038	De Leon	Kevin	102	DaiegGG5yrM	1411	1426	Yet, as of today, we've heard no questions. Specifically, and I'll be partisan in this case, we have no questions from the Republicans, as to why gas prices go up and go down, go up and go down. Not one single.
1039	Thurmond	Tony	4	ozW7w3cwjzc	160	176	Can we speak further beyond today's hearing? I know of at least two bills that address school-based mental health. And if there's a way to link the delivery of the service to that funding, if that's an available funding stream to move the services, we'd like to talk with you further just to understand how that might work. Thank you.
1040	Pavley	Fran	104	FapiTOGMI3c	1174	1186	This is SB 248. 471 is the easier one, Mr. Dahle, that you will love to vote for. So, Senate, I keep presenting them until you vote aye, so we'll be here awhile.
1041	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	heZIL8I4UGg	1148	1160	A couple of questions. Isn't part of the ... Well, it's my understanding, and I'm carrying the CEQA bill that I guess was going to be heard right after this minor efforts to tweak CEQA.
1042	De Leon	Kevin	102	ofo4g2uUHBA	1026	1039	Thank you very much Senator Mitchell for the very thorough and very good questions for our appointee before us today. Mr. Rogers, let me just make a brief comment.
1043	McCarty	Kevin	22	XZ58s4vcLvc	970	982	And, and Sac State, CSU Sacramento was able to purchase a few excess a state parcel as well. A former, a former CYA facility. And a former CalSTRS building.
1044	De Leon	Kevin	102	SNbIvbnUyMw	897	910	So I think I can speak for this committee that we're very, very perplexed, still, nonetheless of the attitude, the culture, the behavior of the Department as a whole.
1045	Roth	Richard	106	m8iyuGdEmL0	117	135	In my opinion we've not devoted enough time, money and attention to educating In training businesses, in providing ADA access specialists, to help ensure access for all. I used this example yesterday but it, it remains true today and it has been unfortunately for some time.
1046	Hertzberg	Robert	99	miQ0Fm1d12I	2317	2344	You know, and the, and the fees come back to California. It's a California entity, we're competing in a global market place, I, I don't understand, you know, the other side of that trade. It, it makes no sense, because we're, we're getting a huge benefit from it, right? And, and you have global market place, multi jurisdictional market place you want to participate in. And that's what we're trying to capture that market, what difference?
1047	Hueso	Ben	48	I00r4tID8_Y	623	641	I think there's been enough information to suggest that there may be an absence of sufficient monitoring or oversight in the process to insure that... information is made available to our state and the people of our state. And that... there's a process that's being conducted safely.
1048	De Leon	Kevin	102	XFSLCFM97Og	69	88	In this case, Director of Child Support Services. That is Ms. Alisha Griffin. Ms. Alisha Griffin. Welcome. Welcome. Why don't you start off with a brief statement? But if you'd like to introduce anyone, please do so. And we can go to your statement, and then we'll go to Q&A.
1049	De Leon	Kevin	102	wxAms1gWFJA	1099	1125	If approved this sales enhancement and resulting projects will improve public transit, reduce traffic congestion and promote sustainable regional development. Los Angeles as you all know very well is one of the most congested transportation corridors and with the projective population growth of more than one and a half million in the next 20 to 30 years we can assume that congestion will only get worse unless investments are made to improve mobility.
1050	Moorlach	John	4657	hOtjCIoL344	41	60	I've been to the museum and I think they also have a touring exhibit that's very impressive. I'm just confused by maybe the terminology that's used. So you're saying we haven't done anything with this program in the past and this is brand new?
1051	Cooley	Ken	45	6rjOa1qOGPA	1963	1982	Yes. To start on this, I wanna say the amendments I read to you were not taken in the transportation committee, they were actually taken after we went out. I asked the county to look closely at what might be done to be more accommodating to Amador county. I was sort of a volunteer.
1052	Gipson	Mike	28	F7lT9yIrGAY	3	20	I want to say good morning to everyone welcome to the joint legislative audit committee this is a committee and the first of several hearings on audit reports. I want to encourage all members to come to room 126  as soon as possible so that we can establish quorum.
1053	Liu	Carol	63	2ZjsVXuo_n0	783	798	You can certainly always call it back. Next committee it goes to is Governance and Finance. We talk about the money, but the structure is something that we heard from the field that needs to be massaged.
1054	Bates	Pat	58	uaZYquORnnU	1811	1830	I do think it needs to be narrowed in terms of what an eligible organization is and I think I've expressed my concern that we granted ARB and those agencies rather huge latitude in defining some of these pieces of legislation, these directives which I frankly feel are very important.
1055	Allen	Benjamin	70	gAWN8j6c6Vc	973	993	And for non-hydrocarbon bearing aquifers, the total dissolve solids content of the water in the aquifer cannot be below 3,000 milligrams per liter. The aquifer must be geographically isolated. And the board must determine if the injection of discharge water will not contaminate a source of water that is current or potential future beneficial use.
1056	Hall	Isadore	1	lVI-Q1bHrK4	724	746	Yes, I'm just curious. You mentioned that there will be about a million folks that could potentially be screened if everybody who went to the hospital was absolutely screened, right? But everyone won't be screened because everyone going to a hospital or visiting a hospital won't have blood drawn, correct?
1057	Lara	Ricardo	107	XQwWN6GsS_M	212	229	Thank you. And definitely appreciate the administration's efforts to continue to support a critical portion and very important part of our state. Those programs are imperative, but what currently exist now is a patchwork of these different initiatives.
1058	Anderson	Joel	57	fDaysw_EoYM	547	564	Abigail is a kind hearted, energetic, clever, and adventurous young woman. As a straight-A 5th grade student at Rancho San Diego elementary school, Abigail has achieved recognition for excellence in leadership among her faculty and her peers.
1059	Leno	Mark	60	PFn_-ARbOZU	761	778	And right as the Senate sub committee was taking its action, a week or so ago, I believe my office is probably not alone in receiving a letter from Western Dental saying that they were not going to be taking any additional patients. Do you wanna comment on that please?
1060	Holden	Chris	78	3qih0GbNdAY	1476	1507	Well, first of all I'd like to thank the committee and members for their comments. And also to reiterate our commitment to continue to work with, and I won't call them opposition. But I will say that CTA and CFT have been very committed to staying connected with us on this. And we have tried to reciprocate. We ask the you move the bill out today in support.
1061	Allen	Benjamin	70	gAWN8j6c6Vc	953	972	Under SB454 for hydrocarbon bearing aquifers, the agencies must ensure the aquifers is geographically isolated so discharge water cannot contaminate nearby aquifers. Also any discharge into the aquifer cannot negatively impact any potential beneficial uses of the water in the aquifer.
1062	Williams	Das	12	9Wrqwep82C8	1402	1421	I was very interested in as much detail that you could provide on your S2 and S3 policies. Particularly, I know when you do a slide you have to sometimes illustrate what you do, but not how you do it.
1063	Block	Marty	59	3F-MRhTliC4	79	104	Now, some folks have expressed a concern about due process because flash incarceration is a quick process. To alleviate these concerns, SB266 as it's now written, will allow offenders to reject periods of flash incarceration after violation is found. So the ultimate authority to reject flash incarceration is with the period person on probation.
1064	Wood	Jim	72	2gM15KHmKpo	830	841	So to say that you want to support 266's framework, I think is, doesn't make a lot of sense because there really isn't anything there at this point. So I guess if you don't want to support anything that's fine.
1065	Lara	Ricardo	107	tHDAU5JmwzE	21	35	Senator Bates and I embark on this Maiden voyage. I also like to thank, take a second to thank our Senate President Pro Tempore, Kevin Deleon for his continued leadership in the senate.
1066	Nguyen	Janet	65	jWp79DKV-DI	968	989	We have other committees, criminal justice Committee as well that includes all the players. We would meet monthly just to talk about what works, what hasn't worked. What can we expand, what do we bring forward as a policy. And so they're public meeting, but very informal meeting on the fifth floor of the Board of Supervisors in the conference room.
1067	Mendoza	Tony	52	WDMO-JAPunI	457	482	US Legal argued that the board, the CRB, lacked jurisdiction to issue citations to them. In the subsequent 2012 case, Court Reporters Board vs California vs US Legal, the court agreed with US Legal, finding that the CRB had no authority to impose sanctions and fines against US Legal for non-compliance with anti gift giving regulations.
1068	Santiago	Miguel	17	eYTxGLtgMco	894	926	And, when I supported the, the the chair's bill we also knew that a district can actually set aside with this bill if they didn't think they already had the authority and I, and I would be a strong proponent that they did, to set aside the monies to reach whatever num, percentage they thought they should have in order to have the good, bond ratings, or in order to weather a storm, if, if if, if, if there was gonna be a problem with, with with, with revenue declines into the district.
1069	Low	Evan	11	sA6uJxeRGKk	1173	1185	This bill will bring transparency to the process by requiring that notices given to workers when an elevator is required and allows workers to participate in the hearing. I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
1070	Mullin	Kevin	31	cKW0dtBGGXY	1578	1597	Thank you madam chair, thank you senator for your efforts here. I certainly appreciate the intention here. I plan on supporting it, I just wanted to give you the opportunity to address this concern. Because it was one that resonated with me, that we got a process going on, a regulatory process with green chemistry.
1071	Hernandez	Roger	37	9Qb9_l0YcHY	548	565	I know that you spoke about turnover, there has been a lot of turnover. So, from one aspect maybe you speak to it from the standpoint of what are we doing to retain these young bright minds that are part of the organization that we want to keep, where we want to see longer tenure there, so there isn't a lot of that feeding.
1072	Thurmond	Tony	4	L_fXwOpVblo	777	790	I want us to do this in a way where we don't create more confusion that prevents us from getting data that can save lives. Potentially the life of the young person just born.
1073	Bonta	Rob	85	TZMmjuYAlwA	7	24	Thank you. With this is a companion bill to Senator Pan's bill to increase the tobacco tax by $2.00. It allocates those revenues towards important programs increasing Medi-cal provider reimbursement rates, something many of you on this committee are very supportive of. I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
1074	Allen	Benjamin	70	mTcFXIImlIA	757	775	Nearly everyone, from my father's generation and generations older than him, when I'd go and speak to groups, talk about the stories that they have both from their own childhood, from friends, personal stories of near-death experiences, friends they had who were maimed by communicable diseases.
1075	Beall	Jim	92	JK2AAP7nJZs	895	920	Thank you, Madame President. This bill, AB 1269, is a straightforward bill. It just simply extends the sunset date to January 2021 for sales and use tax exclusion for high-tech manufacturing that's under the California Alternative Energy and Advance Transportation Financing Authority of the State Treasurer's office.
1076	Patterson	Jim	119	h4u4YccC9Z8	1457	1485	Or the other choice is to take officers off the street to drive long distances in California. It can be somewhere in the neighborhood of three to four hours each way. It takes officers an entire day, driving long distances, to get to three incinerator locations in the state of California and then, again must pay thousands of dollars for disposal fees.
1077	Liu	Carol	63	RChcWpGW4gA	1380	1397	First, thank you, first it makes an update to the current membership of the Commission. This correction is non fiscal and reflects the change in duties of the Labor Commissioner. Who now acts as the Chief of the Division of Labor Standards Enforcements, in the Department of Industrial Relations, a position that no longer exists.
1078	Liu	Carol	63	RChcWpGW4gA	1422	1440	and represent a potential general fund cost savings to the state. And I have today Nancy Kirshner Rodriguez Executive Director of the Commission. And a member of the fund raise, no she's not a member of the fund raising Committee, but she's the Executive Director if you have any questions.
1079	Beall	Jim	92	jsJrqv78Trc	566	589	So, I just want to say that Senator, you know, because I have a personal family history of that particular issue. You know, we went to church, we cried, we prayed. Eighteen months we all lived in different places, but we kept our family together and it was a very traumatic experience for us. So thank you for raising that.
1080	Atkins	Toni	110	KEeiqVKf9vU	725	745	in this year's budget for the state Earned Income Tax Credit. California's EITC will help two million hardworking low-income Californians and put money back into local economies. The $263 million we provided for a comprehensive package of child care services will help more struggling
1081	Gipson	Mike	28	1NMKnZlsrlM	60	75	so if this gets pulled away and now this is attached to my body. Right, so my question is does this still pick up the actual in-time, if you will, occurrences taking place?
1082	Wood	Jim	72	h3qpDny4S5o	513	523	That's not really a great system. That's not a system. That's not the way we should be delivering care in California. So, I just would love to be able to go back and say, you know, can we can we look at something.
1083	Garcia	Eduardo	38	9aoEJ21mmKA	1116	1129	From a public policy standpoint, what would be the top two or three actions that you would recommend, Mr. Kelly, if you were on this side of the dice?
1084	Stone	Mark	20	mKpc_b2HFII	1196	1217	Thank you. And I wanna thank everybody for coming out today. Here we sit in a city that's known internationally for its tolerance. And in a political national landscape of struggling with tolerance and what that means and sometimes we take some steps ahead and we take some steps backward.
1085	Block	Marty	59	iMCgrPZ8vzk	402	436	minutes words to say after we've heard from both panels, and they'll have covered most everything, but if there's more than a minute words to add, besides just your support of one side or the other, please don't hesitate to provide to us in writing either now or in the next few days those additional comments. But only one-minute of oral testimony. Before I call up any panel, I'd like to introduce Senator Hueso who was with us at the very beginning and Senator Galgiani who just arrived, I'd like to thank both of you for being here. We have other members, I said
1086	Block	Marty	59	SvIBnS8_PpY	1515	1526	But, to higher ed. It seems that from multiple sources, PPIC says we need a million more baccalaureate degrees by 2025 and we're on track to prepare right now.
1087	Waldron	Marie	29	hrVBNy8V670	1833	1846	It actually makes this bill complementary even more so with hers. Because now with the hearing process, it will streamline that process for the counties who would now be mandated to hold a hearing prior to a certain day.
1088	Chiu	David	7	Vrc3ih-DRQU	683	689	Seeing and hearing no further debate, we can take a voice vote on the ammendments. All those in favor of the amendments, please say aye, all opposed say nay. The ayes have it. The amendments are adopted and the bill is out to print and back on file.
1089	Wolk	Lois	94	2V6gzfYtqAs	11	40	Assemblymember, I'm just having trouble with your bill, and I believe that our staffs did talk about this earlier. We have required screenings. There's some listed in the analysis, but we've required that. We have long conversations about it and bills, and we have done that for good reason.
1090	Williams	Das	12	_Z7ChiMRbIg	527	555	Other questions comments from the Committee? I think the author and everyone here is also dealing with a different problem than just consumer behavior. That's part of it. The other part of it is the growth of cheaper short-lived batteries from overseas, and so the hard part about this, and the reason why I do think that the author, I really encourage the author to get the battery industry on board.
1091	Allen	Benjamin	70	m25jL11Z0rE	95	108	Seven years ago, the Department of Public Health released guidelines that have helped physicians and patients across the country. These guidelines equipped our primary care physicians with up-to-date patient information and resources to better serve patients with Alzheimer's.
1092	Berryhill	Tom	54	CVYbaFO-ROE	679	690	Yeah, my concerns with this bill is like the case of the 21st century project, many times it's not just the vendors, but the state plays a big role in this stuff crashing and burning.
1093	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	SQUPcyDaRgg	435	449	But I think to point out one agency when we have a really serious problem with privacy here is just not the right approach. Although, thank you for raising the issue. I just think it's a much bigger issue than this.
1094	Gaines	Ted	24	9GlTqPUGK00	127	147	Thank you, Senator Beall. Members, any debate or discussion? Seeing none. Members, any objection to our unanimous roll call? Seeing none. Aye's: 40, No's: Zero. Measure passes. We'll now move to file item 75. Senator Hancock. Secretary please read.
1095	Mendoza	Tony	52	VHKwUGu3F0g	1178	1203	They oversee a majority of vital services to our residents including healthcare, public safety, traffic, social services, public works, park, libraries among other things harbor, although elected the number of members on this county board supervisor has not changed since the creation of these county board of supervisors over 150 years ago even though there's been dramatic changes in the state's population.
1096	Rendon	Anthony	120	yegxkcxS3po	537	577	The West and Central Basin Water Districts worked  cooperatively together for quite some time under one management. In 2006, conflicts between the two agencies caused them to split formally. The Central Basin has continued to clash with other agencies, which is costing significant amounts of public funding in legal fees. Also board members behavior at Central Basin has also been called into question in recent media reports. This audit request is specifically focusing on concerns that I and the other co-requestors have with respect to expenditure of public funds, public trust, and transparency.
1097	Melendez	Melissa	41	2aI5J_1P430	925	948	That being said, when you talk about the cap in trade money that will go or that is going toward transportation, I just want to clarify something. It goes to transit, not transportation, as we're discussing today. Right? I mean, there is a distinction between the two. Would you agree with that?
1098	Chiu	David	7	Bf9_WjQyNCc	1332	1343	Great. And I want to just say I very much appreciate your efforts and probably my staff will contact you to see if we can understand exactly where the state of play is with this information.
1099	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	akOKQetVqu4	30	44	In LA County we had a board of supervisors' election in June, it significantly drove up the turnout because there was a massive, not just voter registration drive, but turnout operation, but that takes resources.
1100	Liu	Carol	63	UpKpxYjD9F8	416	432	Yes, there are certain-- there are basic bottom line issues in the evaluation system that we have identified just like the LCAP plan, you know, those eight elements, those things cannot-- that's the floor, OK. So you can only raise the bar.
1101	Leno	Mark	60	BcOJ4WzBt0M	717	733	Thank you, Assemblywoman, you make a compelling argument here. Again for the same reasons, yet to be determined final revenues and other priorities, we're gonna hold it open. Page 25, district hospitals. Assembly proposal, Mr. Martin.
1102	Allen	Benjamin	70	oTonvRu6EKM	1287	1300	El Segundo, Santa Monica, Torrence, exactly. So I'd love to ask, Chairman Marcus, and I appreciate your forbearance and also get some comments from the other panelists about this if they have thoughts.
1103	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	kMP7GilTLLE	1153	1173	If they were trying to sell you something, they would be -- it would be in very clear language but here, there's a real question about whether or not they're trying to tell you and give you information that will be useful to you so that efforts can be made to communicate relevant information to affected California residents.
1104	Bates	Pat	58	vjd6Y9hnzuc	1105	1121	Because we're having hospitals close, generally in the system, and those, in fact, in the county we have those shown on our emergency response that they're there and if by some unfortunate economic circumstance they close, what is going to replace them?
1105	Atkins	Toni	110	lKgPPhMwBGU	1056	1070	So, the courts have ruled that a measure like this does not necessarily constitute always a taking.  The second issue, which I think is more the area where we are trying to work on.
1106	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	kMP7GilTLLE	1173	1195	So, this bill directs the information currently required under existing law to be presented in one page with the information grouped into five headings; what happened; what information was involved; what we, the company or the agency, are doing; what you can do; and then for more information, who you contact.
1107	Mayes	Chad	79	Mfs9_24i5lo	748	759	And so these classified employees every single year work for ten months out of the year.  They're off for two months. Ten months. And they've been working for how long? Is this temporary? Are these temporary jobs?
1108	Chau	Ed	116	5o713VccuaM	1071	1089	It would also authorize a judge to issue a court order to install a pen register or a trap and trace device upon the finding that the use of such device is relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation and there is probable cause to believe that it will lead to obtaining evidence of a crime.
1109	Leno	Mark	60	mzRsScITOGM	70	89	There are reasons that we included it, I'm happy to continue that conversation with the committee as to why we think it's important. But it is taking us author's amendment to remove it for now. And I thought it might be of some value, just to state the CPUC's own mission statement as we begin this conversation.
1110	Thurmond	Tony	4	9zx01qulT20	96	110	This bill would close that loophole and ensure that every firefighter receives the benefits that are properly bargained for. This bill does not extend any new benefit. It has bipartisan support and has received no no votes.
1111	Bonilla	Susan	3	D1U0Ojzunqk	459	471	So, just so the committee members know that as you express your concerns or areas of interest around the bill, we will have another opportunity to look at it. With that, Mr. Bloom.
1112	Hueso	Ben	48	218-RTK66_I	576	597	In order to narrowly tailor the applicability of this law to address the concerns of the court, we have narrowly tailored the bill to only those who have used the internet in the commission of their crime or a sexual exploitation crime or sexual trafficking.
1113	Hueso	Ben	48	218-RTK66_I	489	510	We're addressing the cost issue and there are costs beyond Proposition 35 that result in a process created by the sharing of information. We are working to remove a lot of these costs and a lot of these processes currently.
1114	Gipson	Mike	28	yegxkcxS3po	933	954	Thank you very much. The effected agency, would you please join us at the table. And, provide your presentation. After which we'll have our members, the members to weigh in with any questions right after their presentation. Thank you very much.
1115	Ting	Philip	30	i194v81Ek5E	1044	1059	Decrease the, decrease the budget by 50 million. Obviously, totally very, very supportive of what you're trying to do in terms of making sure that, working families get the tax relief that they need in this area.
1116	Medina	Jose	81	rhQS6ToXbi0	170	187	With me today is tribal member Alex Tortes, a member of the Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla Tribe, and a retired Riverside Police Department lieutenant area commander for 33 years, and most recently a founding member of the Riverside Tribal Liaison unit.
1117	Nguyen	Janet	65	gDPCmEU7pmg	349	367	So if there are multiple affected areas, how are you gonna have two individuals from the affected area serve? Are we talking about multiple committees? Because areas affected could be north, south, east, west.
1118	Bonta	Rob	85	eOaXlPRJTVY	281	302	The current language in the bill does just that. AB 533 takes the patient out of the middle of the dispute, and requires enrollees receiving services from out of network physicians at in-network facilities to pay only the in-network cost sharing. Or in other words, the same cost that the enrollee would have paid to the physician for covered benefits if the the physician was in-network.
1119	Hall	Isadore	1	BNQtV-nHj20	385	405	Long Beach, for instance, has a similar deal. The port of Long Beach. And I believe there's this a 75 years we offered. We were, originally, asking for 75 years to be in parity with Long Beach.
1120	Williams	Das	12	PeQL6v-QN50	1562	1578	an example of the kinds of celebration that can happen in a multi-cultural society that can put aside our differences. I respectfully ask for your I vote that we may join our fellow Californians in celebrating ...
1121	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	72agwOjIAlc	1172	1194	Well I just want to quickly make a statement. I'm gonna go ahead and vote for your bill Mr. Cooley, specifically because I'm looking at this as Peace Officers standard training, and Mr Lackey and I sit on a subcommittee on budget, sub 5 for budget.
1122	Leno	Mark	60	EP8eVPLyUZg	204	226	There will be further benefits to firefighters of Semerwood in the years to come, and that's why they're in support of the bill to the degree and again, we're not trying to ban. I've tried that, it's not happening. We're just trying to better inform consumers. Which is, I suspect, one of the reasons you're supporting the bill.
1123	Bonilla	Susan	3	WgBOQU7UIHU	1367	1386	They're participating in a variety of activities, sporting events, concerts and other forms of entertainment. According to the 2014 report by the Department of Developmental Services, there are approximately 53,000 persons with physical disabilities that could benefit from an adult changing station.
1124	Beall	Jim	92	vppxPTwkbs8	1787	1820	So I think for us in this special session we need to maybe come up with a punch list of things we could do for project delivery if we're ever going to consider any funding I think that has to be done, and then efficiency's at Cal Trans in terms of making the organization, what kind of changes in the organization do you inspire us to see in the next few years that we can work together on.
1125	Levine	Marc	8	PeQL6v-QN50	1387	1412	ACR 2 is important to Californians. Here in California we find ourselves in a State of renewal as we look deeply at fulfilling the value and promise of California, California is home to more than half of all Iranian immigrants living in the United States I invite all Californians to join them as we celebrate spring and this time of rebirth happy ... members, I ask for an aye vote on this resolution.
1126	Chau	Ed	116	kAZMIWno7zI	1675	1686	Now obviously that issue has been discussed time and again whether we should provide for encryption, number one, and number two if we do for encryption, what kind of encryption are we going to do.
1127	Brown	Cheryl	13	MJ3yc4dhcxc	608	625	They are additionally co-sponsors because we're trying to make a difference in this logistics world. I have with me today Dr. Ray Wolfe who is the general manager, executive director of SANBAG.
1128	De Leon	Kevin	102	bG49iSrqac0	1344	1366	Each time, when the residing officer, Emanuel, would address his colleagues on this office body as gentlemen, she would get up and she would ring this bell, as a very clear reminder, as a very powerful symbolic reminder that it is not only a body of men, but it is a body of very powerful women, Roseanne Vuich.
1129	Maienschein	Brian	84	QmHhObaXRjg	1345	1359	And Mr. Wieckowski, I certainly, I think speaking generally for the Committee and for the staff I want to thank you for your willingness to continue to work on this. I think as can be heard from some of the opposition today
1130	Cooley	Ken	45	KrJyHNx6FKg	99	120	a fair argument can be made to the cause of action against CIGA does not accrue until that uncertainty's been resolved. And this idea, that the claim cannot be settled by CIGA until the very end of the litigation process, when the actual recovery in the insolvency proceeding is known has not been California law.
1131	Burke	Autumn	6	TSE2ocY_LpM	1016	1036	there is no guarantee that they will implement the evaluation system in a long term capacity. In fact, a simple change of leadership with Caltech could put the evaluation system in jeopardy. With this bill, we can ensure that the evaluation system will be operational by January 1st, 2017, and additionally give the Legislature much needed oversight on the issue.
1132	Gomez	Jimmy	80	rSN8XCdpbf8	51	69	We are asking folks to stick to the fiscal issues. If you're presenting on suspense bills, we're gonna ask you to have one person for three minutes or three people for one minute apiece. So, we're gonna move this along.
1133	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	etnGLuiVGv4	140	155	Thank you. Members I am bringing up AB 3 for concurrence. It's a district bill for Mr. Williams and if you're still willing to vote for this bill I'll show you the beautiful picture of his daughter. I respectfully ask for an aye vote.
1134	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	l9VB53WlnQ0	916	934	You're saying majority, thank you. And with regard to efficiencies, I think that's what this whole conversation's about. The UC is top notch, it's a research institution, it's a place of innovation, that then boils out, and benefits our communities, and certainly our economy. Are there further efficiencies to be found within the UC system?
1135	Hueso	Ben	48	LVzFkfmZq9U	1346	1367	They've been meeting with representatives of other states and other parts of the country that have already done this. That serves as a model, but I'm telling you, as far as California's concern, in my district, my district has seven border crossings, and this would be of immense benefit to the people doing business along the border economy.
1136	Cooper	Jim	21	JX3K3k4qzkE	101	122	Hard working government employees do their best to combat the problem, but often within adequate resources or the data or equipment to effectively do their jobs. There are four major state task forces focused on the underground economy, but it is not clear overall, what the outcomes have been.
1137	Melendez	Melissa	41	J0XgdYqFY4Y	120	127	There's some concern, understandably about how we would put this into practice So I am here to learn this morning and find out where we want to be with the field
1138	Brown	Cheryl	13	SaBiGmhdX4s	63	78	Good morning, my name is Cheryl Brown, and I am excited about being here as well, because in my community, we need more jobs, we need more businesses, and I am happy to do the work of this committee, thank you.
1139	Monning	Bill	25	23IlHVpz85o	1523	1540	SB 344 will prepare California's implementation on the most basic component of these regulations, and we should not take the stance of waiting on the federal government to act, especially since it's been more than 20 years since Congress' initial law to require the training.
1140	Gipson	Mike	28	rw_EhgHmCSQ	3	18	Thank you very much to Doctor Allen. I appreciate both of your presentations and I'm the new kid on the block, and so I didn't have the benefit of knowing, until afterwards, Senator Padilla's bill.
1141	Hueso	Ben	48	OaKXojP7k_0	1009	1028	law saying that you cannot deny reimbursing receipt to use that service. I think that's bad public policy ladies and gentlemen we should not be doing that here this is not what this Legislature should be doing. Getting
1142	Gallagher	James	108	1wxe7O9piQI	532	557	OK. So, what I'm hearing is that money isn't-- in terms of fees and portion of profits paid that, nothing in that is going to be included in substantial compliance under the bill. Maybe just hearing from International Franchise Association, is there certain things in here that you're concerned about that would be considered substantial compliance that in your mind would be a material breach?
1143	Mitchell	Holly	64	N91f_wLf7XI	1091	1107	Thank you for your fresh eyes on the language we use, Senator Stone, so we probably should say maximum family cap because I immediately realized where he was going, maximum family cap was what you were talking about. Thank you. Ms Schott?
1144	Mitchell	Holly	64	lanFVKv-H-g	1727	1753	That's three strong ayes. All right. Item number eight, notification of increases in federal grants. Recommendation is to modify the budget bill language to require the administration to report increases in federal grants over 400k on a quarterly basis, et cetera, et cetera.
1145	Bonta	Rob	85	eYvHQ6iO6CE	969	982	Thank you, witnesses in opposition? Seeing none. Questions from committee members. Seeing none. We have a motion, we have a second, Assembly Member Stone, would you like to close?
1146	Garcia	Eduardo	38	yVd5ZErYEYE	138	164	Good morning, Assembly Member Garcia, I represent Eastern Riverside County, the Coachella Valley, and Imperial County. I'd like to go back to Assembly Member Brown's question about the reducing disparities project. And you mention the RFP, will there be opportunities to do some technical assistance workshops for those organizations who are potentially seeking these funds?
1147	Steinorth	Marc	35	PZ5qNcZ4hzo	369	395	Again thank you members. I appreciate the time I am very gratified that so many members are very encouraged at making sure that animals are not suffering needlessly and really dying in our shelters. I appreciate all of the members and my caucus friends that decided that, trying to make sure that they don't discriminate against this small, young, fluffy puppy and so I would welcome all of you to please go out there and adopt a shelter animal today. Thank you very much. With that I ask for an aye vote.
1148	Dababneh	Matthew	50	NNzDQCiG5UU	1647	1666	Mr. Speaker, I rise today to adjourn the memory of Nancy Sweeney who passed away recently in the San Fernando Valley. Nancy was an influential community leader, well-known throughout the San Fernando Valley for her tireless work to improve the community of Reseda.
1149	Alejo	Luis	9	B4ry1_3tU0U	630	649	But, I think the reality is, is that this bill is not intended and will not impact any immigration attorney who is following the law. We all know, in every profession, not just in [law], in every profession, and the the Legislature weighs in on rules on attorneys through this committee and we have the Business and Profession Committee.
1150	Leno	Mark	60	ZhE_hzRecAQ	642	662	The bill was recently amended to provide that for repeat juvenile offenders, so if a young person has his or her record sealed and then re-offends, prosecutors will be able to access their otherwise sealed records to determine the appropriate disposition for that minor
1151	Chavez	Rocky	83	JG7mRMz5Gp8	1140	1167	So I think to draw the comparison is not totally correct because you can be elected with no education and fill that role. In fact, I think there's somebody running for president that doesn't even have a college degree. But you cannot probably be a superintendent or a city manager without a number of degrees and special skills that do that. So, I think the comparison isn't appropriate. So, thank you, sir.
1152	Hill	Jerry	66	V40hlwpKzww	1862	1884	So I don't see a difference, really, unless I'm missing something, of the level a physician would try certain tests to see whether this meets that particular protocol, and that diagnosis, until he gets it right, and then try something else. And what I'm hearing is you would do the same thing at your level of experience, which at that basic level would probably be the same as a physician would be doing.
1153	Moorlach	John	4657	nMgNQIdoyHs	523	533	What does the ATF do? They're doing excise tax as well. Have we ever thought of having a relationship with them where we pay them to collect our fees?
1154	Beall	Jim	92	nMgNQIdoyHs	493	522	So you know we can deregulate, we can do that but then there's nobody to catch the bad guys. We need to have more than the 25, 30% class recovery on these things.
1155	Hill	Jerry	66	V40hlwpKzww	1840	1862	If that doesn't work, you'll try something else, and then if it gets to a point, you'll go to a physician to do that. And I guess my experience has been, I'll go to a physician with a particular ailment, complaint of some kind. And they'll do different levels of testing to determine what it is, usually the least invasive first, and then get to the point where they have to.
1156	Hernandez	Ed	103	BDjsPtF4Upk	1786	1795	They have to have appointment times within a certain period of time. They have to have physicians within a certain radius. They are mandated by law to provide that.
1157	Hernandez	Ed	103	BDjsPtF4Upk	1767	1786	It says we talk about reducing access. Well, let me tell you, every single insurance company in this state that is either under the Department of managed health care or CDI, have to meet very rigorous standards of providing provider networks and have to have access.
1158	Hill	Jerry	66	R5jZe-4pYBI	346	362	We're not talking about for-profit hospitals here. Those for-profit hospitals, they should be subject to the corporate practice of medicine. This is non profit ones that we're concerned with and that's what the amendment is about, that the author has chosen not to take.
1159	Wilk	Scott	19	FgksiwkXKF4	1024	1036	First off, I'd like to start by accepting the proposed committee amendments, and I'd like to thank you, mister chair, as well as vice chair and the committee staff for frankly producing a much better bill, so I want to thank you all for your efforts.
1160	Hueso	Ben	48	KFPGF5cSaEI	240	251	and that case needs to be fully based on facts so the only real way to test those facts is to give people access to that information so they can make,
1161	Lara	Ricardo	107	kbDiQqGDHBM	1633	1647	Aye's - 36, no's - 0, Assembly amendments are concurred in. Moving on to item 59, AB 1124, members, AB 1124, file item 59. Secretary, please call the absent members.
1162	Santiago	Miguel	17	zWDrC8wHRhs	1212	1225	But I'd also like to know a little bit of maybe about the rationale for how the fee structures were set if there can be some clarity on that because certainly when we're going about this new structure for an MCO tax.
1163	Lopez	Patty	89	jsJrqv78Trc	781	795	Good morning. I'm new in this but, I'm same, I'm passionate with housing. In my district is a really high need and especially for the senior population. I would like to know if you have anything in place for that.
1164	Leno	Mark	60	cRT-vVNBfAE	1520	1552	The outstanding amount is about $8 million, I understand. This is a one-time debt, it's one-time money. This has no out year impact, and it would attend to, as many of my colleagues have already stated, promises made. I would like to think in the size of our budget we've got a one-time expenditure affordable to attend to this. So that's question a.
1165	Hernandez	Ed	103	kbDiQqGDHBM	195	211	This will permit healthcare employers to continue to offer a meal period waiver which allows employees working twelve-hour shifts a schedule, very common in the healthcare industry, to voluntarily waive one of their two meal periods.
1166	Gordon	Richard	117	ZurQFkaNhto	77	90	Existing law establishes a uniform complaint procedure under the California Department of Education. Currently, this procedure is used for complaints regarding educational programs such as unlawful pupil fees, bullying, and discrimination.
1167	Bonta	Rob	85	1ZfwQ7P4YFk	74	90	The goal is to provide us the information we need as a Committee to craft solutions that will place these two important programs on sound and sustainable financial footing. At this point, I'd like to ask if there are any Members of the Committee who'd like to make opening remarks?
1168	Cannella	Anthony	61	8L1SsBHKNBQ	737	755	So, that brings a lot of angst to a lot of folks that this fee was passed. And so I think the legislature passed it. Did you two have any involvement in any of that? Were you lobbying on behalf of the SRA? Did you have any say in the SRA? Was there any involvement at all?
1169	Anderson	Joel	57	5WD5y8t5m5U	746	761	And it's not incumbent upon us to pursue that and chase down the ghosts. It's the other side's obligation to bring that information forward if they believe that, that's a pivotal part of why their side should win.
1170	Cannella	Anthony	61	8L1SsBHKNBQ	758	771	So the legislature passed it, right? So now it's given to you to implement. So what were your options? Could you have said, we so much do not believe in this that we are not going to implement the fee? I mean really, would that be possible for you to do that?
1171	Chiu	David	7	4jcAwL2kOMo	80	99	us to structure this so that we are both sensitive, to what folks do not know, both business owners and workers, but also move people into safety, into making sure our workers are being paid fairly, and ensuring that everyone is obeying the law. So really, appreciate your reaction and look forward to working with all of us on this.
1172	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	4XOeWVTUKok	659	677	Mr. Chair and members. AB 672 requires CDCR to provide transitional services to wrongfully convicted individuals upon their release from prison. Over the last two decades, the number of exonerated in the United States has nearly tripled every year.
1173	Hernandez	Ed	103	1fof-e9skdQ	1279	1298	It currently has eight. Enough votes to get out. That bill is out. We are now going to lift the calls. We're going to start off with item number 1, SB 4, do pass to Appropriations. Call the absent members.
1174	Hall	Isadore	1	Xjq2sHgkTwU	1125	1146	We protect our streets against murderers and child molesters, and vicious criminals that attack our society each and every day. Legislators don't do that. We put ourselves on the front line, not knowing whether or not we're coming home each and every day.
1175	Fuller	Jean	49	pnu4iUzw8JA	772	791	The two things that... that I feel the need to talk about just briefly are number one, I just need to set it straight about jobs because one of my three counties happens to be... produces eighty percent of the gas and oil, eighty percent of the solar, and seventy percent of the wind.
1176	McGuire	Mike	93	GHyOxyKfubI	1932	1954	This bill deals only with medical marijuana and does nothing to legalize the recreational use of marijuana. Voters will have their say soon enough. Finally Madam Chair, your committee staff has also made several suggested clean ups in language, which we greatly appreciate and would like to take the opportunity to continue to work with you and your staff on this language as we amend the bill in the next committee.
1177	Pan	Richard	96	BDjsPtF4Upk	472	486	As long as they have a radiologist somewhere else around town, they got their adequate network, they're not necessarily having to contract. And so, you now have a physician who isn't able to come to a contract with the health plan.
1178	Hill	Jerry	66	IyL6hnUxBjA	1350	1377	Do you, and this is kinda based on what we've just Learned in the last couple of days are, former First Lady and former Secretary of State, and the email system that she was using, by the device that she was using, whether that was legal or illegal, do you and do other commissioners use solely for PUC business? The Enterprise PUC system that's provided to you.
1179	Hertzberg	Robert	99	Zewkjo1Xkzc	1152	1177	The book's going to be published. You should be notified. The movie is going to be made. It's gone to the endgame and it's been greenlighted at a motion picture studio. You should be notified. But the early process, the question becomes, when you have a strict scrutiny standard and you wanna protect this creative process, do you want to have that chilling effect on that process?
1180	Gallagher	James	108	5dSl7g7OdCI	1312	1327	But that was zero dollars and it went to, by the time I was coming on the board in '09, $15 million annual pension costs. That's money that's not going to roads. That's money that's not going to basic services that we needed in our local county.
1181	Weber	Shirley	44	5kU8DLIkLSI	1972	1987	But we're going to work to make sure that the values that we've identified at the beginning are responded to in the conference committee. And hopefully, in our negotiation with the Governor as we work to get the budget passed and to reflect the agenda and the items that we think are important.
1182	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	_wQgbHlbFh8	758	778	So if we can focus it on that with all due respect to this gentleman, I don't want to get into mapping here, mapping there. This just says you have the right to a reasonable expectation of privacy in your own home. And California being the state that says privacy is a fundamental constitutional right, explicit in our constitution.
1183	Chiu	David	7	5E8YMvh3dfU	439	453	We have found that recipients of DACA, 59% of them have obtained new jobs, 49% have opened up their first bank account, 21% are able to obtain health care, 45% have seen an increase in their job earnings.
1184	Hill	Jerry	66	kbDiQqGDHBM	575	589	Thank you, Mr. President and members. Back on concurrence is SB 27 which puts forward a comprehensive solution to antibiotic use in livestock. Amendments made in the Assembly strengthen the bill and removed opposition from the National Resources Defense Council, CalPerg and others.
1185	Salas	Rudy	34	h6unjkXLW0o	447	464	Can you tell us, here in the committee, how that money is being utilized to help some of these communities. I know you mentioned the food banks, you mentioned the bottled water, some of those things. But it's a lot of money in wondering.
1186	Wagner	Donald	88	XAJHKAVYVrw	668	681	I mean, essentially aren't we giving general fund, ultimately, giving general fund help to these folks and is that really the best way to use the money, to use the general fund.
1187	Mitchell	Holly	64	V8GPRDBjfho	174	201	Because the Department sort of points at the regional centers, the Regional Centers started to  point at the Department. So to really figure out how we can answer the question Senator Monning about looking at that chart and understanding why different communities from different sides of the railroad tracks, frankly aren't accessing services that it's clear that they're entitled to and could benefit from.
1188	Nguyen	Janet	65	msMPqU5kPd8	624	636	I just wanna make sure. 'Cause, I mean, that was a very critical, component that was very important to me. To makin' sure that those parents who choose to homeschool their children has a choice.
1189	Stone	Mark	20	fFPxgxAj-oM	654	684	What impact would that have on the individuals who are paying the bill, on the providers, vis a vis our ability to leverage those dollars and go a lot further with advanced services money? Because looking at Connect America and all these other pieces it seems like we have more control over the advanced services funds. And is there a way that we can recast that look to make that a much more effective pot of money, to be able to drive the goals that we're talking about today?
1190	Vidak	Andy	56	dOwUIOiNQpY	472	494	Anyone else in support of SB 162? Alright. Let's hear from opposition. Is there anybody here opposed to SB 162? Like to testify? Alright. Seeing no formal. Do you have questions of the author? Senator Jackson.
1191	Hertzberg	Robert	99	VHKwUGu3F0g	1618	1636	Quite frankly even if you had a board of supervisors for this San Diego valley for example that represented 2 million people they're still each member. If there were five like we have across the state constitutionally it still represent 400,000 a piece, but they're still huge districts. So, Senator Nguyen?
1192	Mitchell	Holly	64	2tOIPOStcDA	1415	1434	Several of the assumptions used for this estimate in the analysis are not representative of current efforts already underway by 22 school districts in the state. In these districts, additional staffing has not been required. Additionally, the number used to estimate parental appeals is based on the total number of middle and high schools in the entire state.
1193	Mitchell	Holly	64	6KgzpeS3bCM	1774	1794	Yes, the clarifying question. I clarified question. Legislation that became statute in 2013 directed to the Department Healthcare Services to establish a California Health Home Program in the Medi-Cal Program, so how is workgroup different? Is it because you're looking at programs outside of Medi-Cal?
1194	Stone	Jeff	26	xvNlOWm4ksM	693	709	So we have big states, New York, Texas. Do they not have systems that would complement our needs in the state of California that we could borrow from them, buy from them? In other words, are we recreating a wheel that may already exist out there?
1195	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	HgBIr1hupMw	151	177	And to provide fair pay for child care providers. We're not going to create incentives for people to enter in to this very, very important work unless we pay them appropriately. Since support for child care and preschool is now at a $1.1 billion below the 27-28 allocation, we believe in significant investment in early care and education.
1196	Beall	Jim	92	mP-vrfDi2aA	24	45	Thank you members. The consent calendar, we'll act on that first. That will consist of the following items.  Items 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.  Can I have a motion approving the consent calendar please?
1197	Dodd	Bill	71	9fvwP7KwrvY	1685	1716	And I'm just wondering to the senator's point, if maybe that in itself has evolved to the point where maybe it doesn't really make a lot of sense at all, and so what we're doing here is we're going around, there are other issues. But this one seems to really be a big issue and I heard a lot of people come and testify, that I will support this bill but I wont if these exemptions, not exemptions, these.
1198	Leno	Mark	60	mkixEOc2Tj4	118	135	Middle and high school students who have never smoked a traditional cigarette are now using e-cigarettes, despite the fact that our former colleague, Senator Ellen Corbett was successful in putting into statute, a ban on sales to minors.
1199	Monning	Bill	25	Vek2DamGMzQ	904	926	She's developed expertise on the law's implementation in Oregon. Also, Mr. Chair, as you can recognize, there are many supporters here today and by prior agreement, since this is the fiscal committee and not a policy committee, They are here to show their support if it's appropriate. Maybe if the chair could ask them just to indicate their presence by a show of hands. That'd be appreciated.
1200	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	m48b5iZN1Uo	92	117	Over the past several years, my colleagues and I in the Legislature, in partnership with the alliance for Boys and Men of Color have passed over 20 bills that we hope will create tangible change within these communities. These policies have dealt with a range of issues, including reducing school suspensions, and ensuring ex-offenders are given an equal chance in the hiring process.
1201	Mendoza	Tony	52	vPceAWe-pfQ	4	17	Exciting. A lot of family members here, on all kinds of sides. Ready to have some good discussions. We will begin as a sub committee, until other members arrive. And then we will go ahead and begin with a quorum.
1202	Linder	Eric	39	bsC6VSsjVLI	676	691	To be clear, AB 1171 does not change current design build authority, nor expand the number of qualified projects, or alternative delivery methods, but provides CMGC authority for use on a previously eligible project as another project tool delivery.
1203	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	m48b5iZN1Uo	117	139	However, despite such progress, more work must be done to address systemic inequalities for some of our most vulnerable youth. And that is why we are here today, to hear from both youth and agency leaders on the implementation of important polices that seek to improve our youth with more opportunities, thank you.
1204	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	Wt_ez7F9UlE	1385	1403	I think nice money if you can do it. But your bill will make it more public. Disclosure will be required and then with the amendments, there will have to be that attempts to reconcile that in the existing documentation. Any other questions?
1205	Wilk	Scott	19	zZG9dtpoc3o	33	47	Thank you, Madam Chair and members. In the State of California, one must carry a valid drivers license in order to operate a vehicle. In the event that one is pulled over in a traffic stop, he or she must present law enforcement with identification.
1206	Bonta	Rob	85	DU81cGAPz1I	35	53	And I just wanna thank you all for joining us today for this hearing on the Developmental Services System and the first hearing of this Special Session Committee. Before the break, we received some general overview information about the states, Developmental Services system, as well as information about the service delivery challenges in the community.
1207	Wieckowski	Bob	55	scqfU4UsUAo	1654	1669	The Senate Bill 117 extends sunset of the existing law that allows alarm companies to form limited liability companies. I'm accepting the amendment set forth in your committee report that will shorten the period from five years to three years.
1208	Stone	Jeff	26	JT1Tm7zEIWc	1110	1134	I mean AB 1513 tolls the statute of limitations, that tells me that delays the amount of time that somebody could file a lawsuit, and we're adding more liability, legal liability which is expensive liability in perpetuity. It's going to create new liability for employers who pay employees piece rate.
1209	Williams	Das	12	jAVMxyN_c9U	1172	1197	I do want to answer some of the facts left out in the comments from the other side of the aisle, my two colleagues from Orange County. Number one, while the per watt cost in California is higher because of the investments that the state has led on in energy efficiency, California's residential rate payers actually pay one of the lower amounts of totality of dollars.
1210	Leno	Mark	60	4HKs3ChJG74	1134	1148	Yes. I think we all recognize right now we're relying on the creativity and generosity of angels, rather than taking care of things ourselves. We have Senator Moorlach, then Senator Monning and Senator Roth.
1211	Weber	Shirley	44	bencsnxh2-c	663	675	We have to look at the proliferation of these institutions, the implications it has for those in our communities, and make sure that when people make those choices, they make the informed choices. Knowing what the options are and then put some safeguards in it.
1212	Lackey	Tom	10	A_iRTPZL_LQ	307	328	I have a quick suggestion. I would like to ask for amendment consideration that we include others that maybe associated with sworn officers, like staff or unsworn personnel, who also tamper with this evidence to be included in this statute.
1213	Gomez	Jimmy	80	E5Lv9C_D3vg	1349	1398	Do pass. A roll call. What's that? Okay. Okay. SB 484, Beall, foster care and psychotropic medication group homes. Do pass with clarifying and technical amendments. Yeah. A roll call. SB 490, Beall, Regional Centers vendor audits, hold in Committee.
1214	Mitchell	Holly	64	C_H3N21mnys	2155	2171	Because, you know, I think the reality since '08 that both the provider community and parents need of care are, you know, still recovering from post-traumatic stress because very year it's a yo-yo. We have slots. We cut slots. We have slots. We cut slots.
1215	De Leon	Kevin	102	8as6rPb5Xb0	1083	1107	So, you have access issue that will be compounded because the demand of young students and nontraditional students to get into the system itself. Once you're in the system, you have an affordability issue, and that's why it's taking folks a longer time to graduate. Whether they're incurring much more debt or they're working two or three jobs, or if they have a child, or two. It's taking them that much more longer.
1216	Bonta	Rob	85	-C1RVRucLcc	175	186	Thank you, I just had a couple questions about the stakeholder/work process. What's the timeline for completion of that process?  Is there one or is it kind of ongoing?
1217	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	yhx1NvxzAgA	988	1002	We have federal courts and we have international courts of law where most of these crimes have been adjudicated. I happen to believe that is the appropriate place, particularly when we're talking about crimes of genocide.
1218	Garcia	Cristina	112	Y0xkoNoudD0	484	497	Again, I want to highlight that this is all began with strong women from the State of California and a Commission that was solely focused on women, and while much has changed, we continue to see inequality towards women.
1219	Nielsen	Jim	68	l9ONzDCnLn4	344	358	And, I would argue in this particular case, that we might be able to compromise some, but the Library Services Act, which passed I think in 1977, that is also important.
1220	McGuire	Mike	93	MCkdJZZjTXo	1273	1332	And I think just carrying on, and I thank you, director, for that, is that, and I think you said it yourself, it's going to take some, my words, some significant time to transition. And from my research, what I've seen is that particularly in group homes you have individuals that either contract with the group home manager or actually has medical staff on board with their own staff that are prescribing these medications, and the state simply is not tracking that. I guess where my piece is, California has to be focused. If we're looking at a wholesale change, and as we know, it's gonna take time, but these foster youth don't have the time, and the longer we wait the worse the outcome is for foster youth. So let's get into that a bit about your thoughts on that.
1221	Liu	Carol	63	8TJNuTDd7yI	13	33	Thank you. This bill requires the California Transportation Commission to review updates to the California transportation plan. And prepare specific recommendations to improve the statewide integrated multi-modal transportation system. Including high occupancy vehicles. Passenger rail, bus service, and other travel modes.
1222	Pan	Richard	96	hnhklV-igrA	1356	1372	Hepatitis B, it is possible for a child to pass. Well basically, a child, people with close contacts, so who spend a lot of time with each other can pass hepatitis B from one to another.
1223	Nguyen	Janet	65	gDPCmEU7pmg	1005	1036	Okay. Okay, I'm sorry. With that just maybe a consideration, so that we don't have to come back and update the bill in the future. Is maybe up to certain square miles for residents input because if you do that then there's no argument down in the cities or the local districts to say, well, we thought it would be 25, 100 or whatever it is. I mean, just a thought. That's all the questions I have. Thank you. Senator Beall?
1224	Gray	Adam	27	CGzgwiFisVc	667	726	Okay thank you, any additional questions? Seeing none, thank you all for your participation today. I appreciate all of your work on behalf of California. Okay at this time we're gonna move to our next panel. Suitability standards for licensure. If everyone would approach. Welcome everyone. Thank you for your willingness to participate in today's hearing. I think we're gonna begin with Chairman Grubbe. Thank you for being here, sir.
1225	Nielsen	Jim	68	5cbDr55Nnpw	2041	2057	But as one of the few who started this organization and we deliberated the name. It was important to all of us to make sure America stood out. Asian, Pacific-Islander, American
1226	Hertzberg	Robert	99	cvDmVx__4xs	1647	1654	 And just a question, you said you pay $80 million in all on taxes to the state. How much of that is the personal property tax related to this measure?
1227	Mitchell	Holly	64	oFD3dFY_sMo	842	857	As a consequence the MFG rule actually increases child poverty and for those reasons I brought the measure back to your committee, sir. And I have a number of key policy leaders and experts in poverty alleviation across the the state who are here to testify and support.
1228	Stone	Mark	20	eYvHQ6iO6CE	601	616	What this bill would do is, under their license from the state, be allowed to provide medical coverage or bring medical providers onto the site of the residential care facility, to provide the treatment.
1229	Nielsen	Jim	68	5cbDr55Nnpw	1980	2007	These Russian and eastern European immigrants. That is the fundamental premise. If you want to come here and stay, you become a citizen. You don't want to, then you must go back. You want to come here, we can have certain short time visas. We've always had such things, as the bracero program, and green card, and H2 to allow some workers to come temporarily.
1230	Cooper	Jim	21	221fDwPaPVs	1352	1363	And it would be interesting to know, because do we need to bring some of those agencies under and what were their, what was the rationale for them being excluded and should everybody be under it because obviously, it's much easier if your under one system.
1231	McCarty	Kevin	22	ZcJSZ4qEe4Y	45	57	We've seen the research showing that at-risk kids who attend preschool are 29% more likely to have been a graduate of high school and 46% less likely to have been involved in the criminal justice system.
1232	Nazarian	Adrin	36	51wXJ30ZLf4	154	169	The use of step therapy can lead to an exacerbation of a patient's condition, causing irreversible deterioration or damage to the patient such as limiting daily functions and ability to remain a productive member of workforce or society.
1233	Nguyen	Janet	65	ik8_Xx3XS1w	978	996	Another concerns I've been hearing is that out-of-state students help fund the gaps in the UC budget that in-state tuition cannot help. However, the legislature was highlighted by the Sacramento Bee this past May for funding millions of dollars for out-of-state students with state funds.
1234	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	TF5gOrTe590	1429	1444	Well clearly I don't want to require that a nurse practitioner report every time they order an aspirin. There's got to be some medium here, a happy medium, and I appreciate your comments.
1235	Hill	Jerry	66	bRElxDg8F20	152	183	The other part that they say complicates this, it's interesting, and that's why I have a hard time understanding it, because in 2012, Senator Hernandez had SB 1301, which the pharmacists supported, which would require them to communicate with the physician if they wanted to increase a prescription time period from 30 days to 90 days, to allow for a 90 day prescription, they want it. So, when it was in their best interest to make the communication, they were certainly supportive of that.
1236	Gipson	Mike	28	LZmU6GkVIb4	20	33	Thank you very much. We want to ask my colleagues to please just introduce themselves very briefly, and then we can get started and commence with the business before us. We're gonna start on my right.
1237	Pan	Richard	96	UtqZNbCPgNM	1063	1079	Yeah, I, too, actually share Senator Roth's actually somewhat- are you puzzled? I'm puzzled at the opposition. Because, at least how I see this bill is, is that's about developing a standardized measuring tool.
1238	McGuire	Mike	93	msHMXzeLRF8	368	396	An astounding one to four adolescents in foster care and 56% of foster youth residing in group homes are prescribed at least one psychotropic medication. Furthermore, for those youth prescribed psych meds, nearly 60% were prescribed an antipsychotic, the powerful drug class most associated with extremely damaging side effects and 36% were prescribed multiple medications.
1239	Pan	Richard	96	n5MXFS_19l0	744	758	So I just wanna be a little cautious about, I agree with you that people should know if someone's committed, you know, a serious crime like sexual assault, that they don't have a way they can evade that and so transfer to another school and the other school doesn't know, and so forth.
1240	Hill	Jerry	66	XrOqCob7jCo	1041	1058	We've added some language to make it clearer that unless you have, unless there's evidence that a licensee has used, fired a weapon or had some violations or some concerns you would not really retest them if grandfathered in.
1241	Bonta	Rob	85	qbDN-8u61LI	1870	1880	This bill takes some different approaches than AB 266. And in full disclosure, I'm a joint author of AB 266 along with some of my colleagues as you well know, but for others who may not.
1242	Holden	Chris	78	5xjBSsaNwEY	848	862	AB 1162 requires that all seven FDA approved medications and all three types of counseling are covered. It also prohibits prior authorization for over-the-counter drugs and at least one prescription drug.
1243	Hancock	Loni	98	4RPfdYzqQQc	478	505	As an alternative, SB 644 creates a process that requires successful completion of an internship with the state agency of at least 512 hours and certification by the agency that the employee has completed the internship and demonstrated the skills, knowledge, and abilities necessary to successfully perform the job.
1244	Maienschein	Brian	84	lri5mYqnVgw	41	53	Our first panel will cover the application and collection of TOTs, the uptech in home sharing and short term vacation rental websites, and will highlight some of the legal issues at play.
1245	Brown	Cheryl	13	m48b5iZN1Uo	419	428	So without further ado, I would like to make sure that we get started. So that we won't be too late and we can hear from those who are going to speak to us.
1246	Beall	Jim	92	suW9diU5Tzo	1137	1155	And the bill mandates psychotropic drugs to be recorded on all foster youth's health passports. As foster youth moves, their medical history, the psychotropic drug use, also moves with them to provide health professionals with access to the important information.
1247	Holden	Chris	78	Zr9Ph03Ms5A	1649	1669	Thank you, Mr. Speaker. AB 173 removes the sunset date on law that allows the city of La Verne to permit use of golf carts by authorized entities on public roadways between facilities exclusively for maintenance and security.
1248	Hernandez	Roger	37	tJoPe6FpmUg	0	25	Good afternoon and welcome to today's Assembly Committee on Labor and Employment for this Wednesday, July 8, 2015. Today it looks like we're not quite at quorum yet. One shy. So we'll commence as a subcommittee. When we arrive at quorum, we'll pause, take roll and secure quorum.
1249	Hill	Jerry	66	kj6ztr1oPBg	971	991	For example, current law says that wine sold in California has to contain at least 75% of its grapes from the county of origin. To advertise as a wine from that region. In other words, to be advertised as a Santa Barbara wine, only 75% of the grapes have to be grown in Santa Barbara.
1250	Garcia	Cristina	112	oyGJSKS61pM	654	674	To address, there are, as you said, 418 boards and this bill encourages, doesn't just encourage, but asks them to come up with a solution that works around their needs. It's not mandating a new facility and working with all the stakeholders to make sure that the language, as this moves forward, makes that clear also. The intent here is to create
1251	Gray	Adam	27	NB_4qAwCIAU	165	178	As technology has evolved so has the manner in which games are played and marketed to the customer. Throughout all these changes, it is clear that gambling has a major presence in the state, and will continue to grow in scope.
1252	De Leon	Kevin	102	lEnK9AWBVN0	446	462	Normally, we would make strategic wise investment decisions knowing that, at the end of the day, the fiduciary responsibilities of the boards of both pension plans is to hold value for their clients or customers, which are rank and file members.
1253	Nielsen	Jim	68	0sKrxcyZVQA	755	775	In fact, a university professor, in 2009, told us that we needed more of the saline water coming up the Sacramento river. That was his plan but this was something, long ago back in the 60s, called the Reber Plan.
1254	Weber	Shirley	44	NRrL3g0f7-g	948	964	And surely, kindergarten has a very specific curriculum now, not like they did before, were we need to have our children go. I went to one of my schools. I was invited to come recently because my school was concerned that many of the parents continued to believe that because kindergarten
1255	Baker	Catharine	74	dic9GH4s49g	1589	1601	Going to the issue of collective bargaining, the ability of states, excuse me, districts to be able to collectively bargain their own process; That's the reason why we shouldn't have a, a blind seniority mandate in state law. There's not reason for us to have that.
1256	Hertzberg	Robert	99	wHx-nZg7Thw	877	899	The nature of performance of markets have changed, and without a single tax dollar, this is a way, maybe it works, but maybe it doesn't, but this in my judgement is what we should be doing in government, figuring out imaginative, creative ways, without taxpayer dollars, certainly you want to get that as much as possible, I'm a Democrat, we don't want to lose that, but when we can, to do that.
1257	Hertzberg	Robert	99	r2CpJ7yeI28	1791	1822	Chairman, can I just, in learning the customs and practices of this house in the more than decades since I've been here, look as I said early and earnestly, I applaud this author, I think he's a great talent, but I think as has been indicated here, this requires a lot more work. We've got this issue of whether we pass things on with a courtesy vote or not now that looks like. I don't mind, and I have every confidence in his skill set to continue to do the work, and I think he, as a result of this conversation, gets it, but I'd sure like to have some level of comfort.
1258	Quirk	Bill	23	GLTSZcMPtQ8	655	681	Alright. Perhaps you could close and talk to us about who would be eligible under this system, who would not be eligible, and what are experiences with people who've been through a full year, the people who would be likely eligible for this reduction parole period, what experience we have with their recidivism rate.
1259	Ting	Philip	30	jHspOFmZl3U	1230	1246	Got it. And I guess, just to follow up, I know in Santa Cruz, this issue was brought to our attention. So are you saying at the other universities like San Diego or Riverside or Merced or Davis, you haven't heard the same number of complaints or issues or even appeals from those applicants?
1260	Levine	Marc	8	a-vrUIVX5pY	97	125	With me here to speak in support of the bill are Jason Murphy and Nick Balistreri with the University of California. Wes Larson, Cal State University. We want to thank Mr. Levine for adding the C issue to the bill. And we, energy efficiency is very, very important to us as a priority, and we ask for your aye vote.
1261	Bonta	Rob	85	QOFO_OlHLpI	1	11	Thank you, assembly member Gatto and thank you to all the committee members for your deep thought and analysis into this bill, for your thoughtful questions and for the robust debate.
1262	Hernandez	Ed	103	2nTGfRwIGSk	729	754	So let me ask you, if they were to become MediCal dependent, is that a bad thing? I mean, because, so this being a grandfathered plan, does it offer all the 10 essential health benefits? Is it as robust as say a MediCal plan that would offer all of those benefits?  So it does have all the 10 essential health benefits? Okay. All right, just curious. All right is there any other questions?
1263	Leno	Mark	60	AKlY8gGN95I	1605	1620	No and that's not just my suggestion or conjecture. Over half of the population of the State of California is living with this kind of regulation at the local level and the industry is growing exponentially every year.
1264	Weber	Shirley	44	d_EaaILk1VE	1121	1131	It's a Chair and consultation with budget, individuals and resources to determine it which one will come out of suspense, which is my understanding of practice of the suspense file in appropriations.
1265	Chiu	David	7	ZLSVJllIZyI	756	769	- [Mr. Chiu] Okay, well I'll just let folks know what is in their filings and also, what is on your website is that, you say that you collect processing fees and this is a way for travelers and others to save money and time.
1266	Gatto	Mike	46	L_fXwOpVblo	1	22	I don't wanna get too hung up on semantics. I think what you're asking about is the default, because we give parents, under the regime of the bill, we would give parents information, and then we would say, "The state of California stores your samples forever and it allows researchers to do tests, and these tests help save lives. Do you want to opt out of that?"
1267	Santiago	Miguel	17	LjL6ZVCwjY0	442	466	Well that's what we need, in some cases, and at least the UC's willingness. I know that it's there and sometimes these aren't the best places to demonstrate that, right. But sometimes the willingness is say, hey look, these are, this is what we can do through particular pathway programs. And I did read it, I realize you guys have pathway programs. And I know when I was on campus, God, way too long, like 20 years or so, right,
1268	Hancock	Loni	98	Q9LdqK3BIlI	868	895	And as I learn more about that, it appears that the only real way to cut back on the budget significantly would be to close a facility. And that there are some barriers to that because of the standardized staffing that was adopted a few years ago that requires us to maintain full staffing even if the population goes down.
1269	Hertzberg	Robert	99	Sai1lZPOK9g	1755	1767	And if their not held by the standards to which you have appropriately identified, to what end? And then the, I completely agree, it's just, somehow we're gonna have to cross that bridge pretty soon.
1270	Dababneh	Matthew	50	nhD8diu7eMA	117	142	If this is because of the breach happening at a state agency, that onerous burden should not fall on the constituents of ours throughout the state, but rather on the agencies and government that protect them. Should a consumer suffer a data breach, whether at the agency or a business, this measure will ensure the necessary protections are in place to help prevent that they become a future victim of identity theft. I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
1271	Gomez	Jimmy	80	QXW5aikdMmE	145	166	AB 197, Garcia, renewable resources, do pass. B roll call. AB 203, Auburn, Northeast state fire prevention fire fees, do pass with technical revisions. A roll call. AB 276, Alejo, hazardous waste, do pass with amendments to expand the information the department or lead agency may request provide various technical clarifications. A roll call.
1272	Bigelow	Frank	91	HBHfaes5iio	149	170	Kind of noteworthy. Anyway I did want to pay particular attention. And maybe you could clarify once again. How are these schools gonna recover the costs? There may be significant costs with respect to embellishments or mascot motifs put on the floors, the walls, stadiums.
1273	Allen	Benjamin	70	U-gbn_qz8sg	582	605	Crude prices have dropped by more than half. It's the refineries and a portion of the piece of the pie that's increased tremendously. On this chart, it's from 26 cents to $1.32. On years ago, it's from 32 cents up to about 20 and then 89 cents. How free is this market? How free market is this story here?
1274	Holden	Chris	78	EQZBghQKoaM	989	1007	This principle was taken directly from the International Franchise Association's own statement of principles. Any time a franchisor takes over a franchisee's business, the franchisee is entitled to any equity they have built into the business. Transfers.
1275	Hertzberg	Robert	99	wxAms1gWFJA	1698	1709	But I just want to know because this seems to me to be fundamentally different than just a tax. It's an investment. It's cash in the ground that fundamentally changes things. And I want to hear your thoughts on that.
1276	Lara	Ricardo	107	qM5DAHMb8ig	315	325	Thank you. Comments or commit, or questions from committee. Say none, we will place this, without objection place this issue on the suspense file, and look forward to working with you on this issue.
1277	Stone	Jeff	26	oGlT-6EtEZU	1491	1504	We want to keep our good partnership with Canada. Especially having a maternal grandmother that came from Canada that lived here as a Canadian and died here as a Canadian, a very proud Canadian.
1278	Pan	Richard	96	AGRN7-GFw2A	1636	1656	Currently there are no timelines that requires that the Department of Healthcare Services to finalize reimbursement rates, or annual reconciliations for these critical clinics. This has resulted in the department taking approximately five years to finalize a new rate, and approximately three years to finalize reconciliation. Which has resulted in the state owing nearly $50 million to clinics.
1279	Nazarian	Adrin	36	dSqmLCv394A	875	890	Specifically, this bill establishes various notification requirements for both landlords and tenants, and requires the initiation of a bedbug management plan in the event of a bedbug manifestation. Bedbugs continue to be a major challenge for many Californians.
1280	Nazarian	Adrin	36	dSqmLCv394A	890	908	The requirements under this bill will ensure that landlords and tenants work together to eradicate and prevent bedbug infestations. I have worked with supporters and opponents of this bill. I believe that this bill, and the amendments taken in committee today, strike a reasonable balance for all state holders.
1281	Bates	Pat	58	SM79vxJ_AdE	1274	1293	And doing some really in-depth analysis of that, I think is going to get us much closer to our goal. We had, in my city when we were fighting with the county, and I was the county supervisor, to incorporate our community, we had an 87% turnout.
1282	Leno	Mark	60	4l8d3tner_c	186	202	And if it's what, so much about what our debate around how we fund early care and education, so that single parents can get off to work, knowing that their children have quality programs to keep them out of trouble and safe while the parents are off to work.
1283	Mullin	Kevin	31	H9sj-95HbgQ	1526	1539	This is about coming up with a formula. The feds, of course, coming up with a formula that really accurately takes costs into account and can be updated over time, and I think that is a key point here that we need to modernize this.
1284	Dababneh	Matthew	50	GYqLytCM9KA	340	356	The storage and exchange a virtual currency is a growing financial industry with transaction volumes in the billions of dollars every year. This bill will give consumer confidence that they are investing their money with legitimate companies. In the last year-and-a-half, virtual currency losses to consumers from theft and hacking has added to almost half-a-billion dollars.
1285	Roth	Richard	106	tr961U921gU	1462	1478	Let me ask one follow-up having to do with the Prop 41 money. And I understand that we've repurposed this and regulations are forthcoming and we're going to get money out to developers to develop transitional and supportive housing for veterans.
1286	Williams	Das	12	t0t13B_zyEs	222	236	Thank you. Anyone else speaking in support? Speaking in opposition? Seeing none, we'll bring it back to the members. Do I have a motion? I have a motion by Mr. Wood.
1287	Cannella	Anthony	61	MN9yRILD2M0	471	485	I had an opportunity to interview both these individuals yesterday and I'm impressed with their knowledge of the department that was, actually I was looking at your resume, Miss Cleninden. And you started in 1990 as a Office assistant. And today, you're up for the Chief Deputy Director.
1288	Beall	Jim	92	Rbv3X8-oLv8	393	418	Thank you very much, Assemblymember. The first, we're gonna have some presentations, and we'll start with Secretary Brian Kelly and California Transportation Agency, Keely Bosler, Chief Deputy Director of Department of Finance. And Malcolm Dougherty will join them, Director of Caltrans. So, welcome.
1289	Hertzberg	Robert	99	9Z8rBNEmUBE	482	493	Before you leave, I was going to ask Senator Wolk if she would be willing to insert an amendment in the bill to enact a sales tax on services. Would you still be supportive of the measure if we did that amendment?
1290	Garcia	Eduardo	38	RxWs3TzpYXg	1351	1367	Mr. Chair and members, AB 1411 would require the State Fire Marshal, with the advice of the State Board of Fire Services, to adopt regulations and standards requiring a visual and audible warning device that indicates a hazardous and flammable amount of lint in all commercial clothes dryers.
1291	Campos	Nora	76	fRdlkKyIGD4	1095	1118	Southeast Asian males are trapped in the cycle of poverty, prison, and disadvantage. AB 80 would establish a 19 member Inter-agency task force to align state agencies to take a coordinative respond in meeting the challenges of the diverse population that we face here in California.
1292	Salas	Rudy	34	i1dEPEL80sQ	1922	1941	Now member lets proceed to our ... As Ms. Gaines makes her way to the table perhaps we can call on AB362 Waldren. Call the absent members Madame Secretary.
1293	Nielsen	Jim	68	4eIdwcDuXeo	1791	1807	That's primary, Secretary Laird, but other things too, that the expectation that other things are coming out of that bond, too, so it's not just my exclusive concern about surface, although that's preeminent on my mind, of course.
1294	Leno	Mark	60	hSwKpjUIVVQ	1100	1126	 Okay. Thank you. So this Senate proposal with further modifications to the trailer bill language. All right, thank you. The explanation? Vote on the Senate side is 2-1, 3-0. All right, 3-0, 3-0. Like that.
1295	Cooper	Jim	21	KpERIVYvrj0	451	470	We have 25,000 state workers, the most in the region. By trying to get folks out of their cars and onto public transit, we started our own bus system in 2005. We have over 1.1 million riders that are riding the bus, that aren't going down there. Elk Grove had, RT had eight routes, and they were primarily commuter routes, no in town routes.
1296	Hertzberg	Robert	99	gnd2v7Ro_Uo	926	944	There's a lot of folks that are trying to work in that field. I have questions about it quite frankly, cuz I talked to a lot of my people in the finance world, in my old finance world. But why can't, why do you need to, clearly you've been working this bill for a long time, and it's been held up in committees, the governor's vetoed it.
1297	Gaines	Ted	24	MPEe2Ccro74	1186	1204	He's taking that risk and he's enjoying every last-minute. But, I know here today that we're going to take a stand. I'm going to take a stand. For the dignity of life. I'm not going to push the old or the weak out-of-this-world. I think that could be the unintended consequence of this legislation.
1298	Mitchell	Holly	64	2MXVIex_Zeg	488	509	Moving on to 4260, Department of Health Care Services. Number 1, the May 2015 Medical Estimate. Department of Finance Issue 501 and 502. Staff recommendations for approval? And is that on that 3-0? No vote at this time.
1299	Mendoza	Tony	52	SK-C_51Liio	1005	1028	And the new property owners, I mean, to take this burden on, it wouldn't be fair. I do think that if people want to sell their property they can sell it. They need to look at the way the property is being handled. The tenant protections alone can be kind of problematic for any new owner.
1300	Melendez	Melissa	41	iQQbLXy8ddc	320	331	You said that you don't feel that a child can be adequately questioned in that particular type of close circuit environment. Can you explain to me what you mean by that?
1301	Hernandez	Ed	103	8sqAOKYjfF4	799	808	Well that would be under the premise that they're going to be replacing social work with a MFT, they're going to be doing something they're not trained for, but I don't know if this bill addresses that.
1302	Allen	Travis	43	2b3SgDbb8jI	873	889	It was very time consuming and this bill would very simply require accurate page number recredation to be affixed the front of 80 documents being submitted to the county recorder. Bill's very simple idea to protect all of our constituents, and i respectfully ask for your aye vote.
1303	Beall	Jim	92	iJc5cTYtc4Q	1173	1192	And, I hope that everybody understands that it's a good government policy to protect that revenue, cause road repairs and things like that. It's an ongoing kinda condition. You have to do it on a lifecycle. You have to look at the city governments, the county governments, the state's gonna have to look at this like, we're gonna repair this one patch of road.
1304	Stone	Jeff	26	Tb_ZR86SMpk	81	99	Thank you, Madam President and divorce proceeding support can be characterized in two ways. It could be paid by one spouse to the other with after tax dollars not taxable to the beneficiary or paid by one spouse to the other with pretax dollars were in the payment is tax-deductible to the payer and tax-free reeportable to the beneficiary.
1305	McGuire	Mike	93	XKugQ-1Kx3w	168	203	Statutes that contain outdated references potentially confuse the enforcement of this important public safety program and programs. SB133 replaces the outdated references with the correct references. And this bill replaces the Chief of the Bureau of Food and Drug Inspection With the Director of the Department of Public Health and the Caffney Pure Foods Act with the Sherman Food, Drug and Cosmetic law. Mr. Chair, I have Mike Falasco with the Wine Institute with me, that may have a few items to add or answer any technical questions.
1306	Hertzberg	Robert	99	wHx-nZg7Thw	731	743	and using the low dollar investment amounts of what you could do, you could now open a ScholarShare account with 25 bucks, and if you just simply got those points at $200 a month, at $50, you'd have $1934.
1307	Beall	Jim	92	iJc5cTYtc4Q	1121	1137	And given that, then we are going to have to look at things that way. I think for the purposes of the revenue that we're trying to develop here, if we're going to develop revenue, we're going to need a protection for that revenue.
1308	Burke	Autumn	6	vsNWmpwObU4	1078	1104	I'm going to echo also Assemblywomen Bonilla's sentiment that if, if I do in fact support it so that we can continue the conversation, it will be with reser, it will be with maintaining the reservation of the possibility that I would not vote for it on the floor because I do still maintain that I would like to see a tool, not just transparency. Thank you.
1309	Beall	Jim	92	nrJtkVtsuec	917	940	It's the local transit district, BART, which worked with MTC, I think. And they finance the... And I think they call it. What do they call it? Moral obligation by hindsight. It's commonly used to finance transit districts, the full-funding grant agreements. Maybe you can address Senator Pavley's on that financing process.
1310	Bloom	Richard	2	z_nb3rZYxjo	588	611	Well I think it's a pretty big issue. And I confess to not having followed every step of what you just outlined. But this is technology that could be deployed today. And if it were to become more available in the state, and local jurisdictions were to understand that it was available, I think there might be a lot of voluntary adoption around the state that could help save water.
1311	Hernandez	Roger	37	BbpWOgfWUd0	976	1016	The UC will make an argument that the numbers are just used wrong, confusing apples and oranges. In fact it's the same argument they made before the Assembly Budget Committee earlier this year. They argue that most of the high-paid employees are paid by non state funds and it's only certain classifications, such as doctors and leading experts that are paid high salaries. However the UC public information on their website does not distinguish funding sources used to pay high salaries nor does it clearly identify the staff groups limited to high pay categories.
1312	Stone	Mark	20	zjaMes6iB6Q	628	640	Thank you. Any other witnesses in support? Anyone here for opposition? All right, seeing none, I'll bring it back to the committee. I want to thank you Senator for bringing this forward and for the testimony of youth.
1313	Hernandez	Ed	103	zO-5FwV_Tmk	201	228	300 million aggregate net impact to the non-MediCal health plans. That represents a net financial impact to non-MediCal plans that is more than half the amount of other proposals presented to date. This bill is a win-win for Californians, as it will not only generate much needed revenue for healthcare and developmental services, but will also help reduce smoking rates and
1314	Hernandez	Ed	103	zO-5FwV_Tmk	251	270	That we needed to look at additional revenues to help the most neediest and vulnerable in the population. But also we had to look at making sure that we have the MCO tax, which in some form or another, has been brought forth to the Legislature, has been approved in a bipartisan manner.
1315	Bonilla	Susan	3	qXgW2NUq_uc	60	76	We have the midwifery one of top of it which hasn't met since 2011, but this is what is in the Sunset Report that we're trying to get an answer to, and that is if you're not using the structure, if it is not valued, or if the impression that everyone's getting
1316	Olsen	Kristin	15	tnNiyA_YijQ	378	388	doubled just in the last few years, and so we do need to work together and find ways for us to increase investment but also to hold UC accountable
1317	Thurmond	Tony	4	WE6m9wVcbNQ	1291	1313	Different question, but I'm gonna follow on the train that you were just going about. Could we talk about lung capacity? Absolutely. I just read, just now as we were having this conversation, a study that says 10 minutes of smoking e-cigarettes causes noticeable change in airway resistance in the lungs.
1318	Wood	Jim	72	1ZfwQ7P4YFk	795	812	Thank you for the presentation. You talked about $14 billion for planning, modernization. Is that program implementation, and are there timelines associated with that, and what does that really look like, because $14 billion is a lot of money?
1319	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	f3cR0spzrzM	612	631	Did we try to prioritize public financing over regular municipal services? So, that's the, if it's a policy conversation, where does that rank and how does it help if we have to cut street services, police, and fire, or water and power in order to pay for a campaign mailer.
1320	Cooper	Jim	21	yAgUQvRrkrQ	1453	1466	By the end of her life, she served the State of California with distinction as a research program specialist for the Board of Equalization. Lisa's survived by her husband of 10 years, Dwight Buchanan.
1321	Leno	Mark	60	Xjq2sHgkTwU	1417	1435	Right, okay. I'm not un, insensitive to many of the comments that Senator Hall has just made. And to save time, I will list the many classes of peace officers that are not exempt, which have been listed in our analysis.
1322	Hadley	David	40	17weTAXeEGA	1799	1809	One thing we have Learned the immigration policy illegal battles of the past 10 years is that whether members of this house like it or not, the federal government is responsible for making and enforcing immigration law.
1323	Stone	Mark	20	Wt_ez7F9UlE	355	372	Not necessarily done on a case by case basis, sometimes it's a pattern. Particular lawyers who are holding out individuals all the time, maybe always taking someone who is of color. Someone who is transgender. Maybe, always excusing someone who is gay.
1324	Nielsen	Jim	68	bnZY7D5DzoY	70	98	Two years ago the legislature passed AB 1213, the Bobcat Protection Act. It prohibited commercial trapping in the Joshua Tree National Monument and delegated to the Fish and Game Commission the authority to ban bobcat tracking around biological preserves, state conservancies, other private and public wildlife areas.
1325	Irwin	Jacqui	16	w_O6rMiIuwc	366	408	Lastly, I want to emphasize that this bill contains language to require the development, the department to develop a formula for allocating funding that encourages innovation and rewards outstanding service by counting Veterans service officers. This portion of the bill will ensure that the state is spending its money wisely, and will require CVSO's to justify the increase spending. This bill will also ensure that the changes be made to target underserved populations or to adjust to the changing needs of California's Veterans. I have with me Jack Kirwan and Pete Conaty from the California Association of County Veterans Service Officers.
1326	Chavez	Rocky	83	TbimRTTdSU4	192	219	So, this bill basically allows, if somebody has it, they can compete with the current contract, complete the job. But the good example I was using earlier today, if in 2000 the veteran died, and let's say the contract they had terminated in 2001, this business would be able to compete as a DVDE for the remaining two years and re-negotiate another contract.
1327	Beall	Jim	92	gdFGvbqWUf0	45	56	One is what do we thinks working well or pretty well? And what do we think is not working so well In this general area of the state programs.
1328	Lara	Ricardo	107	i7abTEXGU1E	1631	1650	Seeing and hearing none. I do want to make a statement given that the supporters of this bill brought all my friends. Including, I'm surprised my mother and father aren't here. I do want to say, just a statement on this issue.
1329	Nielsen	Jim	68	rXdeWNKFzAk	404	429	And so it's important that we make priority in the general fund of support for California's veterans. The Veterans Service Officers are trained professionals and you are the face, you are the where the rubber meets a road for our veterans. Biggest problem that I've think I am echoing my colleagues, the biggest problem veterans have is accessing services in government, federal and state.
1330	Lara	Ricardo	107	i7abTEXGU1E	1650	1672	Natural gas is an important transitional fuel, but we also need to use these funds to continue to push technologies forward for the development of commercially available zero emission vehicles in a wide range of weight classes. My bill, AB 1204, in which I identified the funding source and
1331	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	_wQgbHlbFh8	118	136	In California, the right of privacy is clearly articulated as one of the fundamental rights; life, liberty, property, privacy. So here in California, we have a very, very strong and constitutional protection to privacy.
1332	Lara	Ricardo	107	rL3huVcX6FI	84	96	These settlements are valid obligations of the state and have time sensitivity. We have from the Attorney General's Office, Robert Sumner if there's any questions about the specific claim. Thank you, I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
1333	Mitchell	Holly	64	ZhE_hzRecAQ	2226	2246	Over the last two decades, the number of people exonerated in this country has nearly tripled every year. After spending decades in prison for crimes they did not commit, wrongfully convicted persons are released back into the community without access to basic transitional services such as housing assistance, job training, or drug rehab.
1334	Pavley	Fran	104	yzBzen_uFsA	142	155	You, ideally, you look at where are your greenhouse gas emissions coming from and develop policies to do reduce, reductions in GHG, depending upon that inventory, we have the inventories.
1335	Wagner	Donald	88	Vrc3ih-DRQU	1487	1510	So I applaud the author's willingness to include the charter schools. I think that work needs to be done. With that said and with no clear explanation as to why we are undoing the Local Control Formula as was expressed and because of this ambiguity on charter schools, I'd urge at this point, a no vote.
1336	Lopez	Patty	89	a4X1msw4NL8	1866	1881	Thank you Mr. Speaker. AB 1207 is back to concurrence senate amendments to add a co-author. For this cost, this bill be a participant and I respectfully ask you for your urgent vote. Aye vote.
1337	Gipson	Mike	28	JfU4ybXUoBc	1714	1729	The State would either pay a low rate through community based care or pay for care at all, if the persons is able to be self sufficient and can afford it themselves.
1338	Bonilla	Susan	3	WgBOQU7UIHU	2257	2274	You try to be prescriptive and they say the cost is too high so you take that out and then they say, well, we don't know what's gonna happen. So you shouldn't do it. At the end of the day, we have a growing population of disabled constituents in each and every one of our districts. This touches all of us.
1339	Chau	Ed	116	LnIRCPhjt4g	794	820	We also have three speakers for this panel. And they're going to be sharing their perspective on the first round of VHHP program and joining us are Meea Kang, who is the President of Domus Development. We also have Mr. Stephen Peck, MSW, who is the President and CEO of US Vets. And finally, we have Mr. Ken Trimble, PE principal of Trimble Shots LLC.
1340	Irwin	Jacqui	16	pyW7Y47fazc	1629	1654	So I just, in the case of Corinthian it was basically financial instability, but we are also concerned with the educational outcome. Are these vets getting jobs, and is that the role of CSAAVE, to look at those type of issues and was that considered at all in the Corinthian case?
1341	Hertzberg	Robert	99	Zz925hDmty8	587	605	That's my sense. I don't know what the sense of the Committee is on this thing, but that's kind of my larger sense. And if it turns out that we're wrong, we do have a window of opportunity come the early part of next year to correct all of these challenges that you're currently facing and solve the problems that you and Senator Hancock rightly addressed.
1342	Leno	Mark	60	4mB1nCFXohc	380	394	So with no other comments we do have a motion by Senator Wilk which will approve the Senate plan which in effect will take this conversation for further consideration at the conference committee.
1343	Hancock	Loni	98	fMvnlUAhyII	477	491	Because, my look at the recidivism definition that you came up with, is that it is absolutely clear if we get that information from each county we will have a baseline.
1344	Wieckowski	Bob	55	heZIL8I4UGg	25	47	Today, we have 13 bills. There are three bills that are on consent calendar. My legislation 207, Senator Galgiani's SB 348, and then the committee's omnibus bill, SB 662.
1345	Hertzberg	Robert	99	g1KhSxf2FKA	652	673	Thank you, sir. Support in question? If you can tailor some of your testimony to the questions that were addressed by the senators, I think we all have evidenced a pretty deep concern and a number of opinions on this, so that would be helpful.
1346	Jones	Brian	42	2b3SgDbb8jI	279	301	Thank you. Mr. Chau, this is an interesting bill to me, I should be conflicted on this, but I'm actually, I have some questions, and I'm gonna be interested in the amendments that you take on the floor, so I think for today, I'm gonna abstain, and the concern for me is, as a City Council member,
1347	Mitchell	Holly	64	Kjr9dgLkxFI	174	197	Thank you very much. That was a great place to close I agree that we must continue to look at the details, which is the point of the joint hearing, the point of us agendizing as this issue today and we're going to hold it open and continue to look very closely at the utilization of supportive services like child care, for example. I have a consistent concern about the level of the stage one case
1348	Hernandez	Ed	103	w8RK3-qsxL8	122	133	So, I am supportive of the measure. And when the appropriate time, I am willing to move it. And to look at how we're going to be able to get these individuals who come here, who want to assimilate in this country.
1349	Chiu	David	7	HccZsvAseDo	337	352	Secretariat of the Japan California Parliamentary Friendship League. As well as the honorable Masato Watanabe, the Consul General of Japan who is located in my home city in San Francisco. Mr. Horii has returned to Sacramento with the Consul General to continue to
1350	Hernandez	Ed	103	pchCRkcA1Ic	505	517	Thank you. Would you like to state your name? If we have anyone else and speak in support we have a microphone right there. If I could just ask you to state your name and your position. Thank you. Please proceed.
1351	Ting	Philip	30	aa6v0aO1V2M	370	377	Because obviously the categories are the same, but at least every district that I have in my district, I've looked at their LCAPs  and they've all done it a little bit differently.
1352	Chiu	David	7	2QITrr6350o	739	753	That has allowed survivors of domestic violence to terminate residential leases early in order to move to safer housing. AB 418 would also decrease a survivor's remaining rent obligation from a 30 days to 14 days.
1353	Chiu	David	7	HccZsvAseDo	518	549	Colleagues, if we could please proceed to our next guest introductions. We have a another former colleague with us on the floor today. Colleagues, if we could please welcome back former Assemblymember Steven Bradford who is with us. Today with Assemblymember Bradford is Doctor Fernando Guerra and
1354	Hernandez	Ed	103	w8RK3-qsxL8	105	122	The state of California is doing that and if you look at how this country is run, states of, within the United States are, are prime to allow the states to do what they want and then they kind, and then the federal government does eventually follow.
1355	Beall	Jim	92	nrJtkVtsuec	1356	1378	Yeah, I'd like to mention the intercity rail projects, the way they work right now is that the state funds them in little pieces. And if you're ever been on board of one of those intercity rail projects, you get a little bit of money here, little bit of money there for each.
1356	Hueso	Ben	48	BdgXqTHNkdY	640	677	This is an extension of what's happening in our country and we need to recognize that when we make with these statements. In this instance, there is an investigation going on, I've taken time to really look into this matter and see what the government is doing. And, this resolution urges the government to support further dialogue between the international community including the United States and human rights organizations on humans rights reforms and that's something that clearly needs to be stated, but that's something that the government is doing.
1357	Wagner	Donald	88	EQZBghQKoaM	311	326	All right. Well, I struggled with this one a little bit. The courts have, I mean, the courts have been dealing with this forever. Doesn't it go back to Hadley versus Baxendale? What's -- I guess I'm wondering, is this not a solution looking for a problem?
1358	Leyva	Connie	62	8UaA3ArF3qo	1108	1122	So thank you. I also thank you for clarifying Chino women's prison is in my district and I appreciate you clarifying some of the women's health screenings that we're going to be changing and I just have one question.
1359	Perea	Henry	33	Hfoe3X0tet8	788	835	Where you have communities that have been developed because three or four dairies sort of came to being and now all of a sudden we had a community of folks. So that's what I'm trying to do with all of these different proposals is make these policies and these funding decisions equitable and relevant to everybody out there regardless of where you live, and so if we can achieve the same outcome within an existing program I'm certainly open to that. But I think, at least when it comes to this particular measure, we went the route of creating a new program because we believe we're filling the gap that currently needs to be filled.
1360	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	AHTUrQ6AUYA	1659	1669	We still need to move the consent calendar. So moved. Second. The consent calendar has been moved. I, so let me move, let me read the consent calendar into the record.
1361	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	tIl0bzr-tVs	1110	1125	So we can't go beyond that specific information that 93% of these offenses are for stolen property. Some of them will also include firearms which will become subject to this, we just don't know the full extent because that, that data has not been kept.
1362	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	6y6CtxPlgMo	1685	1696	And then there's an access issue. Currently, if a young boy or girl wants to participate in competition cheer, they have to go through one of many private clubs or high school team and has to pay to enter in private competition.
1363	De Leon	Kevin	102	oE98JCD72Xk	1454	1480	Sure. Okay. Thank you very much Mr. McCarty. And what I'll do is I'll sort of very quickly just speak to the charging station and the transportation electrification. And then secondly, obviously the DG issue, rooftop solar versus utility solar, utility scales solar. I will give you a somewhat rather ambiguous perspective, and then I'll explain to you the reason why.
1364	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	rEreViIPqP0	101	313	Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Mr. Secretary notes we are absent a quorum. Would the members and Senators please come to the floor for our 9AM session. All Senators to the Senate Floor for our 9AM session, please.
1365	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	-O56kS7yA2Y	1947	1976	It's not just write a report and then that becomes the sacred cow. There's a lot of interrogating that goes on with that and for the first time, I got a feel for that, and I got a feeling if we were to, without getting into an officer's Bill of Rights, but if we were to get into what is the actual process that an officer who has the unfortunate opportunity to discharge their weapon, what they go through.
1366	Hancock	Loni	98	WsNNww2cgqU	780	803	Hold on. Yes. Thank you, Madam Chair and thank you, Assemblyman Jones-Sawyer. Yeah, I think a lot of what we're doing now is trying to simplify a complex system and make it easy to understand and make justice. Not delayed, not denied. Right.
1367	Wilk	Scott	19	VpwREaswL_E	1141	1158	Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chair. As a former community college board of trustee, I had the honor numerous times of participating in the Academy of Canyons graduation ceremonies. And what's interesting, a lot of those students receive their AA degree before they even got their high school diploma which is very exciting.
1368	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	-R4HGT4UbOs	1532	1550	The eagle, Rick Orlav, has flown the nest. It's now left to us to carry on his legacy. I respectfully ask that the California State Assembly join Greater Los Angeles and beyond in mourning the passing of the beloved Rick Orlav. Thank you Mr. Speaker.
1369	McGuire	Mike	93	-1v9avmnxCY	1257	1270	And I am concerned that this puts more authority in the developer's hands, when a city and/or a county can negotiate to what they think is gonna be best serving the residents of that community.
1370	Williams	Das	12	v8nsxSPxdAk	71	97	It is a matter of sort of scientific debate whether a natural gas vehicle in and of itself is a reduction of GHG over say a competing fuel like biodiesel which is why we have required a percentage renewable. Not only to do that but also to comply with the governor's stated wishes in making sure that GHG reduction goes to renewables.
1371	Bonta	Rob	85	DJsU22tiuNg	1577	1594	We're also looking at some other solutions, including a front-end solution that Senator Roth has shown and Dr. Pan has touched on. There's some potential there, and so, I want to have a complete solution here if we can. As you can see, it's difficult but I'm committed to it and will continue to work on it.
1372	Allen	Benjamin	70	MpQ4SGzO7GE	561	575	Right. So, and I appreciate that. I appreciate that particularly when you bring up things like zoning and HOA. I don't get the impression that, that, that those sorts of situations are what the author had in mind when he was authoring this section in the bill.
1373	Patterson	Jim	119	gmSplS1IxCE	891	915	I look forward to seeing it move forward, and hope that it has sufficient teeth in it, and that's why I am supporting this because of the law enforcement support of this, so that we can rein in the kinds of abuses and the kinds of situations which are bothering our residents and scaring them when these medical marijuana shops come into their neighborhoods. Thank you.
1374	Mitchell	Holly	64	Q0YUSKbr_v0	79	103	As a former county supervisor, I've hosted some various health expos that provide free dental, visions, and Medicare for those who are uninsured and/or under-insured especially when Medi-Cal was did away with dental and visions for adults, seniors, and et cetera. So those areas have always been very, very popular at my clinics.
1375	Pan	Richard	96	EeHY3lg6hXA	126	144	CCEE. So, and as we're getting this started but I also see then the plan, we're counting a lot on the CCEE to do a lot of work and I don't want to underestimate what it's going to take to actually get that done in the way that you're describing here today.
1376	Leno	Mark	60	cKW0dtBGGXY	1711	1729	We're looking at all of the many and varied health risks, associated with flame retardants. So this is completely consistent with 65, but it's really a non-sequitur of sorts. It's just not about what we're doing.
1377	Monning	Bill	25	lZ5SEmNPh-U	919	949	So anything the department can provide us, while this is being debated sometimes hotly in our communities, it would be helpful to me to know what current update from Department of Public Health. So, thank you.
1378	Beall	Jim	92	XxAKuU0JQuk	1482	1510	Yes, and the other question would be in terms of health outcomes, we always want to evaluate plans on their performance and not in terms of cost, that's important, but also health outcomes. When you evaluate plans in terms of health outcomes, there are some common evaluation processes that are done, comparing apples to apples, if you want to call it that.
1379	Wieckowski	Bob	55	GChQsueBjgw	1436	1457	While there may be some unknown objections by judicial council, I sort of am looking at all of them and giving it back to the discretion of judges to determine. When they balance the interests of the children and the family interests, reunification may be in order.
1380	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	nJXs6pD2ors	726	756	That doesn't get us to where we need to go. So I would indicate to you that countries like Great Britain have recognized that, although cap and trade encourages as was mentioned, while we have cap and trade, although it encourages sellers to decrease emissions below the levels of a cap, trading doesn't encourage buyers of credit to decrease their emissions, and across the board emissions performance standard, which we are recommending here, requires all facilities to comply equally.
1381	Mitchell	Holly	64	LCBofa05MII	671	685	There are a number of articles and scholarly articles and attitudes with regard to the criminal grand juries system and whether or not it continues to be perceived as a necessary or valuable tool.
1382	Perea	Henry	33	xxo2ATBDxJE	1343	1358	Great. Thank you, Mr. Chair and members. AB 1308 would provide a technical fix that would strengthen the state's apprenticeship system by establishing basic but necessary procedures for the approval of new building and construct, construction trades apprenticeship programs.
1383	Mullin	Kevin	31	_YQzP7dcJFI	158	176	Members, a quorum is present. We ask our guests and visitors in the rear of the chamber and in the gallery to please stand for the prayer. The day's prayer will be offered by our Assembly chaplain, Father Constantine Papademos. Father Papademos.
1384	Melendez	Melissa	41	HpHzTWJvRTs	341	358	Okay. So there's a 30% increase in effect for the current budget year, right? I just wanna make sure I understand because the suggestion is, that we increase the COLA despite the fact that there's all ready been a 30% increase, so I'm just wondering why that is?
1385	Dababneh	Matthew	50	1fxZCVj9XoA	1041	1049	First of all, I'd like to thank Mr. Chair for your help with making sure that we could resolve some issues to make this bill have no opposition at this point.
1386	Cooley	Ken	45	NNzDQCiG5UU	1227	1252	I knew Dan over the course of my career. He was remarkable guy among other things. Believe it or not, in our history of our institution we've had a bill passed and signed a law by the government that had no author and Dan Wall, in the course of his career was the guy who cobbled a to bill together that solved the problem that when it reached the governor's desk had no author's name on it.
1387	Weber	Shirley	44	X5ZwfIJ2xIA	197	222	Despite 350 years of lynchings, burnings, enslavement, and humiliation that resulted in African-Americans living the American nightmare, Doctor King had the audacity and the unmitigated goal to simply have an American dream.And, he paid the ultimate price for working to make his dream a reality.
1388	Pan	Richard	96	m65WWf8IMs4	255	266	And that's why we do put these requirements for that. We heard about the, the peanut analogy. You have a child who has a severe peanut allergy. You suddenly tell everyone you can't bring peanut butter to school.
1389	Fuller	Jean	49	8E9La7s73fc	834	860	So I'm urging to prioritize filling all California needs before exporting any power, and especially in the one day market. I understand the need for the imbalance, but I think I'm very concerned how the board may handle exporting larger amounts of power out, especially if we are highly subsidizing them in California.
1390	Beall	Jim	92	suW9diU5Tzo	1557	1587	Thank you Madam Chair, members, SB 484, Madam Chair, is a bill related to foster youth group homes. And first I would like to thank the committee staff and the committee for all their hard work on the bill and accept the amendments as reflected in the analysis as part of the bill, as author's amendments.
1391	Monning	Bill	25	SyoQEeEJfIE	326	342	Yeah, but does the plan, developing the plan, wait for the hiring of that new director? Is there any works that's, can't work be done developing that plan? Or does, or are you just going to hold it until the new director is hired.
1392	Block	Marty	59	t4hQNDqgAZU	163	180	Is it 100% certain that they'll all come down with deadly disease, of course not. Is it 90% certain, is it 40% certain, is it 2% certain, I mean, what percent does it take to say that homeschool only is the most nonrestrictive educational solution?
1393	Rodriguez	Freddie	69	2HmztWZsIt4	308	327	Especially in the emergency situations that were, we need to take into consideration all the history of those patients because I was reading one of the articles here on the, one examples of, when we do a show-up on folk's houses where they can maintain a sense of calmness for about 20 minutes.
1394	Hertzberg	Robert	99	_NTagRCFfsc	236	251	Thank you so much. Any others in support? Any opposition? You know, I just asked the committee staff for the members to share what the members, in view of what. And I think you're right, Senator Hernandez, of this more strategic approach.
1395	Mitchell	Holly	64	DiYo45O70Kw	307	327	I think critically important for us to be Informed, as soon as they know, as well was approval of supplemental report language that requires DDS to provide the 90 days of determination, then federal funding will not be continued for ICF units, and all of the languages outlined in pages 31 and 32 of the agenda.
1396	Bloom	Richard	2	2IKoCnJyE-g	813	836	I ask you to consider the following. Diabetes is now the seventh largest cause of death in our nation. If current trends are not reversed, one in three children born after 2000 and one in two African-American or Hispanic children are expected to develop type two diabetes during their lifetime.
1397	Allen	Benjamin	70	xngdjnDcNKI	1392	1413	Thank you, thank you so much. And it's actually really encouraging to hear all of your thoughts about various aspects of this Colorado model and the positive experiences you've had so far. Let me ask you just a couple questions. First of all, could you just give us a sense,
1398	Mendoza	Tony	52	vPceAWe-pfQ	975	983	So, let me ask you a quick question. So, the entity that you provide the insurance form which would be cities or whoever that pay into this pool, right?
1399	Wagner	Donald	88	WSuppHjpCKY	1334	1343	What you're saying is, the public policy is protect home ownership, oh, by the way, my bill is now gonna require that they go out and go get a home.
1400	Cannella	Anthony	61	ckv1hzYbS0w	1817	1827	Is there, can you tell us how much greenhouse gases have been reduced because of these programs? Maybe some of them are in their infancy but, and this is Senator Beall talked about this as well, I mean these are very expensive. Can you tell us if they are working or not?
1401	Maienschein	Brian	84	xhI7BgS1JK0	1196	1205	Because we will continue to work on it. We have spent a tremendous amount of time on this, and I think we've come a long way from where we started. So I will pledge to continue to work with you.
1402	Holden	Chris	78	5xjBSsaNwEY	907	928	To address the Chair's specific cost concerns, I'm willing to amend the bill, from allowing unlimited quit attempts, to four each year. I'm also amending it to prohibit prior authorization only for over-the-counter treatments and at least one prescription treatment. A copy of those amendments are being passed out to you now.
1403	Nielsen	Jim	68	LD6QgC66xr0	1668	1686	Thank you Mr. Chairman. Well, you know, we've almost given a blank check to HC Government to raise fees. If it was ever five thousand, I might even be able to vote for it, cause there'd be a limitation, but we're going to give it a cap of 750,000 again.
1404	Weber	Shirley	44	l9ONzDCnLn4	488	499	And, that we shouldn't, what in the world is San Diego building a new library for because nobody is going to show up. And if you have been to San Diego to see the new library next to the Padre stadium, it's awesome.
1405	Hernandez	Ed	103	GBu0gthuabo	712	752	But is somebody in South Central Los Angeles, in Watts, in Compton, will have the exact same care as somebody who works for Google? I don't think so. And I think there's a huge disparity, and so the lens that I'm gonna be looking at this through is comparing that population with the population that has the greatest needs. And my biggest concern is those individuals that are under 138% of poverty level that should have that exact same access. Now, I understand that we're just talking about rates right now.
1406	Ting	Philip	30	G2qYCBsWgfA	24	40	Thank you, Mr. Chair. AB 154 is a federal tax conformity bill. It conforms 12 of the federal tax statutes to streamline government, make it easier for the tax payer. We haven't had a tax conformity bill in about five yeas, so this is long overdue.
1407	Bloom	Richard	2	2IKoCnJyE-g	975	993	Currently, California is falling embarrassingly short. We spend the least on diabetes prevention of any state in the union. There is no state funding for diabetes prevention, and what little funding we do use is provided through grants from the Federal government.
1408	Hill	Jerry	66	Oggr1OKYFzQ	24	45	The devices are easily portable. They are the size of a briefcase and depending on the device's capability, it can even listen in on phone conversations. The devices can find out who a person's calling, the last call made, when the call is made and the location of the call being placed. With proper and adequate oversight the technology may be a helpful and valuable tool to catch criminals.
1409	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	v8EYhSKM6wc	1057	1081	Cheerleaders are athletes and cheerleading should be a sport. And it's time that California recognizes competition cheerleading as an official sport in our high schools. The need for this is, is quite obvious. Cheerleading accounts for approximately 60% of all catastrophic injuries in girls high school athletics, the most dangerous sport, according to the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research at the University of North Carolina.
1410	Wieckowski	Bob	55	5cExo6Kc7gQ	1203	1224	Good morning Mr. Chair and members of the Assembly Judiciary committee. SB308 is a bill that will make long needed meaningful updates to California's exemption laws. In my 28 years of practicing attorney in this area, I can tell you firsthand that these changes are badly needed. Now let's start off.
1411	Block	Marty	59	k_l5daYZc00	659	672	And whatever public comments we get will be taken into consideration by conference. We think this is the right direction. At least at this point in the conversation, to be going. And with that I'd move to approve this item.
1412	Mitchell	Holly	64	DiYo45O70Kw	1036	1061	Public comment on this item? Public comment? I'm going to ask that we make a recommendation as noted in the agenda, recognizing that finance can go before the Joint Legislative Budget Committee and change the scope at a future date.
1413	Weber	Shirley	44	_YWoRdtfoP8	937	949	It has to be a bigger piece, I mean it just -- it's just -- it's, you know, and maybe I'm wrong in how I see this but, you know, I -- I see it as a parent, as a parent and --
1414	Wieckowski	Bob	55	9Kkq97ccCr8	676	699	So whether there's a hard cap, you know I don't believe that at the medium wage of California, when we start talking about medium wages. You can live in a high income area, where the cost of living in the Bay area. Is making a medium wage in the central valley, is much more conducive to surviving than it is in a high income area.
1415	Lara	Ricardo	107	HayxEPtHuzU	482	502	So if we were to work on something on that, cause I know, 35 states consider cheerleading already a sport regardless of its competition or not. I think Texas and New York just did it last year. Were going to be working on something similar. would that help in terms of showing that these men and women are protected under some sort of Title IX?
1416	Bonta	Rob	85	m48b5iZN1Uo	305	332	This hearing, for this reasons in my opinion, is one of the most important hearings of the year. A day where we bring our state's agency and system leaders to the table to discuss the attention they are given to Boys and Men of Color in our state and learn what we can do as legislators to help them fulfill those 67 goals that we believe are critical to the success of so many youth facing unbearable obstacles at home, school, in their communities, and in the job market.
1417	Hernandez	Ed	103	d1S1T4q9GVM	721	735	what we're allowing is three individuals to speak in support, three individuals in opposition, and two minutes each. And after that, you please come up for opposition. And after then, only individuals will be stating their name and their position after that point. But anyway, welcome and please present.
1418	De Leon	Kevin	102	wxAms1gWFJA	1187	1203	It's estimated that Measure R again voted by the voters back in 2008 will create upwards up to 160,000 jobs for Angelinos. Now while Measure R is drastically changing transportation in Los Angeles, the reality is further investment is needed.
1419	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	iSM5Bpt31OQ	1389	1410	Again, focusing on what it's intended for and so consumers are protected from their information being sold which seems to be kind of a real major problem we have to address, or otherwise utilized in an unintended manner. So, I know that you're doing that, and I would just like to encourage that we keep moving in that direction, and I know you will.
1420	Bigelow	Frank	91	XSL2yLxKUCc	83	100	AB 995, you know earlier this morning the tone was just right, it's changed today. AB 995 would allow our onion farmers to operate with a little more flexibility without compromising the safety of other drivers on the road.
1421	Nielsen	Jim	68	oZrbKv34-B8	743	763	It would seem that that should be more specific, should say cannabis cultivation, so there's no confusion of what we're talking about cultivating here. It's not strawberries, that whole section of the bill applies to cannabis, so I expect that's self-evident, but that might be something that we could think of.
1422	Alejo	Luis	9	nhiEIYehp1Y	1096	1117	If you were trying to find a curriculum that's appropriate for high school, none exists right now. Very few text and curriculum exist that's established for high school students. And then so that's what this task force is trying to do. Is having a task force come together, and for the State Superintendent to oversee a framework to develop an ethnic studies curriculum for statewide.
1423	Hertzberg	Robert	99	hp2WTRF5hkg	1488	1501	And, and that's worked extremely well. And you have this incredible pent up demand. This notion of recs, you know, to me, if there's any question, to me that's just, you know, the last minute stab at you to try to create some level of insecurity.
1424	McCarty	Kevin	22	-OpN4Uo7BxE	1825	1845	Mailing out the forms, both in the private sector as well, doing voter registration efforts. All those resources can be better allocated now on voter education and engagement. I think this is a smart innovative approach as we heard earlier, about an idea that is being formulated in the North in Oregon and our time's right here in California. Thank you.
1425	Gomez	Jimmy	80	IhpbvS6HoRM	1359	1478	They are also joining the Independent Energy Producers on a tour of geothermal wind, natural gas, and storage facilities. Please join me in welcoming Ra Moreno T., Patricio Valenzuela V., Sebastin Campos, Ricardo Pacheco Mella, Jorge Vargas Cceres, and Javier Urbina Fuentes.
1426	Lackey	Tom	10	X-EMNVy0KVE	1829	1850	Yeah, I would just like to applaud the fact that we're attempting to make it more difficult for people who have this problem and this compulsion. However, my biggest concern happens to be with the fact that generics are not able to be controlled and take advantage of this particular.
1427	Mayes	Chad	79	dQgHkZmLQFo	1741	1762	In a particularly striking example, a USC student housing project was held up by a competing developer for over two years. The competing developer proudly proclaimed its prowess at using CEQA to bomb competing developments. In cases like this, CEQA litigation both increases housing prices directly through litigation expenses and indirectly by artificially limiting the supply of new housing.
1428	Mayes	Chad	79	dQgHkZmLQFo	1763	1779	AB 641 seeks to address the problem not by providing any exemption or by modifying the standards. Instead, the bill merely limits the duration of litigation and prevents a court from staying or enjoining construction. This is a modest reform that follows the precedent set by the Sacramento Kings area.
1429	Liu	Carol	63	n5MXFS_19l0	293	308	Okay. All right, thank you very much. Any opposition to the bill? We didn't receive any. Any questions or comments from members? The bill has been moved. Would you like to close?
1430	Gatto	Mike	46	DT3707YnrIQ	403	420	It's not in the budget, the Governor did execute an executive order to this effect, I would assume that he would want his executive order to have an effect. Therefore, I think it's safe to say that he would have some degree of support for this General Fund appropriation.
1431	Wolk	Lois	94	C8rLBTiZ2A4	1976	2009	So we're going to continue watching that and encourage you and your efforts.  Let's talk about cost recovery which presents some interesting problems.  There are statutes of limitations on some of these projects which I believe go back, some of them, twenty six years which have not been, somehow we have not managed to close the book on these projects.   These are outstanding cost to the state.  What is your plan to deal with these projects?
1432	Weber	Shirley	44	v8EYhSKM6wc	481	503	So where we may have some angst about testing there's some kids do extremely well in testing. There's some who don't. And this bill addresses it. So it's not about doing that, but if we are not about the business of improving the lives of children in multiple ways then what the hell are we doing? I'm just being very honest about it because if we're not going to do that, why have anybody here?
1433	Dodd	Bill	71	GHyOxyKfubI	671	681	And sometimes they're very, very stressful meetings. And I've seen some people go down over time. Was there some thought process? Was it just the local control and not wanting to put that on the local governments?
1434	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	B4ydjBRtO3M	676	694	Yes, it's good to see you, Sheriff Christianson, and Deputy Sheriff Brown, just need to let you know that the Ceasefire One Program is something that we're gonna look at it budgets of five, I haven't told Assembly Member Lackey yet, but we're looking to hopefully fund it in the CalGRIP program. So I just gave him a heads up.
1435	Leno	Mark	60	SuJy5eE040k	1442	1455	I would imagine we should expect that when we do this one time this year, that there will be another in the January budget. What reason do we have to believe that it wouldn't repeat itself yet again?
1436	Leyva	Connie	62	6Zm0lSVJfAE	800	815	And what I also truly enjoyed is you all seem to genuinely enjoy being around each other, and that's huge because we have to work together and sometimes we have to work with people we don't love working with, but when you really do enjoy who you work with, you can be even more productive.
1437	Nguyen	Janet	65	cFLwRY925G8	591	609	I actually don't see this issue as a rural versus urban areas. This is an issue of access period in California. I represent an area that is very urban, but yet access itself in Orange County has been very limited to Medi-Cal patients and members.
1438	Wood	Jim	72	Y6AL-ziJQBc	934	948	Is it clear what the expectations for the exam? Have the expectations for the exam changed? It's just a rather, to go from 50 something plus to 20%, 24%, that's a huge drop.
1439	Leyva	Connie	62	BDjsPtF4Upk	1596	1614	The problem is they would do it right. They would listen to us. They would get there, and no one had told them that the doctor or the anesthesiologist was out of network and then they would get hit with an even bigger bill than the Senator was talking about, sometimes 10 or $15,000.
1440	Bonta	Rob	85	n81cNAsH1gw	903	924	Additional member questions or comments. See none we have a motion and the second? We, we have a motion in the second, the motion is due passed to judiciary, and with amendments to be taken in judiciary. And so member Ridley Thomas would you like to close?
1441	Quirk	Bill	23	1fxZCVj9XoA	710	730	Alright. Going back to the order of sign in, Mr. Dababneh is next. AB 160, item number three. Let me... I... My microphone wasn't on. Mr. Dababneh AB 160, item number three.
1442	McCarty	Kevin	22	J7_DGCQOA4w	1187	1203	Mr. Ting? Okay. This item was for information and certainly helpful to us as we grapple with coming together with our budget before we finalize in May, and you will give us the additional information and data. No action item here.
1443	Wolk	Lois	94	uk0vIxtVZmg	389	406	So, I would just like to say, yes, it would be wonderful to have a longer process, a special session on drought in which this is the focus, and perhaps the governor will do that, but if not, I think this is about leadership.
1444	Nielsen	Jim	68	TZ3CNB06_OE	609	645	It sort of came home here last when two deputy sherifs in the area that I represent or one of them didn't exactly live in the area I represent, but very close to it, was murdered by a fellow named Marcelo Marquez Bracamonte who had been deported four times. Illegally reentered, came here and one day murdered these two deputy sherifs in a rampage of very historic and serious consequences.
1445	Chavez	Rocky	83	7bdBeI04iMY	572	587	really give you knowledge and does not really give you the decision points and what you want to do to move forward I'm trouble with this bill when I noticed that this Committee that we're going to set up is
1446	Chiu	David	7	f1-nJuHExxE	936	953	I just want to say, 66 years after the Equal Pay Act was legislated, the fact that we still have women only making 80 cents on the dollar is abysmal, and with that, I want to thank the author for pulling together such a great coalition and working through to develop the consensus that you have. Happy to move the bill forward.
1447	Nguyen	Janet	65	m25jL11Z0rE	1303	1315	And, you know, because a lot of the children who don't want to wear glasses or actually not knowing, ends up always in the back of the classroom, and they end up not doing well in school, and that's the start of their life and we don't want that.
1448	Huff	Bob	105	2Yu9E6dAMwM	1597	1606	And when you're fired on the basis of seniority when you're let go on the basis of seniority who's going to fill that? You're going to have some substitute come in and do that?
1449	Huff	Bob	105	1tbz59-ST4g	362	376	This passed with 61% of the vote. Unfortunately both of these measures left loopholes that allow the state to direct other transportation money to the general fund. Specifically waive fees, vehicle registration fees, and vehicle licensing fees.
1450	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	CGzgwiFisVc	353	375	And so I'll make a commitment. Obviously you weren't here earlier when I asked the Department of Justice to give us that price tag so that we can adequately fund them. Obviously we need to add on top of that any other back log. And, if you just get that number to me, I know we have two votes,
1451	Williams	Das	12	Vrc3ih-DRQU	609	626	Community colleges only make a notation on student transcripts for academic dismissal or academic disqualifications. CSU does make a general notation on transcript if they're expelled for one year or more and UC does make a general notation.
1452	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	ZnhfCEAKzDU	1281	1309	This the longstanding tradition of treating their cheerleaders as glorified volunteers, independent contractors, or simply refusing to abide by basic wage and hour laws. AB 202 would simply clarify what we believe to already be existing California law, and ensure the professional cheerleaders and dancers are treated as employees, protected by all employment law including at least a minimum wage for required practice time, performance, and any other ambassador modeling duties including wait time.
1453	Stone	Mark	20	jIa2_lUgVm8	623	644	But as I read the morality clauses that were put into these courses, or into these teachers' contracts. Just the teaching of something that's outside the tenants of the school in order to satisfy the UC requirements is arguably a violation of the morality clause.
1454	Stone	Mark	20	jIa2_lUgVm8	119	133	Correct, in understanding that in different organizations it may not be a minister, and I'm using that term, as the exception does. Even though that's an inaccurate term for any number of the religions that might be out there.
1455	De Leon	Kevin	102	MN9yRILD2M0	1504	1519	Those who are neutral or don't have a position? Seeing none right now, okay. We've had commentaries and questions already from the members. Unless there's any other further questions for the members or commentaries? Seeing none.
1456	Wolk	Lois	94	CW6mZhhMcnU	737	760	Water loss, although we can not pin point the amount of water that is lost to urban areas due to leaks, we know from various studies that this is an issue. It is an expensive issue. We know that our infrastructure is aging. We know from the extraordinary water main breaks.
1457	Mitchell	Holly	64	LDZM4Nn4wSs	30	55	With the exception of two, and so moving onto page 2 of 23 of part c agenda. We will hear first from the department of managed care. We've had a staff transition here as well as at the table.
1458	Bonta	Rob	85	q7LT4HnI37Y	692	705	correct me if I'm wrong, is that the new workload is being addressed in a timely fashion. So you're meeting all time frames and time benchmarks appropriately. So being faster than what you are now?
1459	Leno	Mark	60	XQwWN6GsS_M	676	689	The entire, Assembly chamber, fell into silence. You wanted to hear the man speak. You wanted to know what came out of his mouth. And he just commanded that kind of respect and attention.
1460	McCarty	Kevin	22	RoufXhlsVZI	917	938	If somebody on a Sunday decided to take their little one to the local bar around the corner and take their little kid in there, they'd call the captain of the police department. There'd be the police department and CPS there within an hour, but it seems that at the breweries, it's a little bit different. Actually few people have asked me this.
1461	Obernolte	Jay	86	bKCoiLHe7ac	379	391	So we're in agreement on that. It's inconsistent the way that we're doing it. You're proposing changing the way that we're doing it in this case and I'm wondering why it's appropriate in this case to change it.
1462	Hernandez	Ed	103	R5jZe-4pYBI	1633	1656	But I wouldn't even mind going a step further and looking that any provider, like a nurse midwife, that there be some kind of statute that says that any entity can't unduly influence the medical decision of that provider. So if that were the case, then I would be totally supportive. So, the reason why I'm not supporting the bill is not because of the merits of what you're trying to achieve.
1463	Leno	Mark	60	0sKrxcyZVQA	1534	1546	All right, folks, I wasn't suggesting recess time. Just a moment pause. So we are moving on to transportation. We will come back to those three issues in resources shortly.
1464	Grove	Shannon	77	adewtR6e1X4	595	615	My hope, and I was very excited when I met Mr. Santi Rogers, and I went back and read his bio and what he's done, my hope is that the administration put this man in that position because he has experience closing DCs. So, hopefully that's what's actually taking place, I would hope. Yes.
1465	Monning	Bill	25	nfRac3nHOas	669	682	And again, I'm the first to respect the discretion we invest in judges who are perhaps in the best position: being informed by district attorneys and defense counsel and probation reports, etcetera. But often, that kicks in more at the time of sentencing post-conviction.
1466	Nazarian	Adrin	36	bgIZ8epTm-I	1550	1575	Currently, TNC's are required to implement a zero tolerance policy. However, the drivers are not tested. If there is a complaint or an accident due to the driver being intoxicated, the driver is then terminated. AB24 will require a drug testing program to ensure that commercial drivers are not driving while intoxicated.
1467	Beall	Jim	92	7Ldg9YBlG9g	2	39	Thank you. I wanted to ask the LAO, and staff... When you look at this issue of the cost of healthcare there's a lot of factors that effect the cost of healthcare and I think when you presented this information there's other variables that you left out that I think we need to explore as potential areas to look at and measure whether or not we're being successful in.
1468	Stone	Mark	20	lVI-Q1bHrK4	1646	1662	But the normal reporting that they're doing through their licensing requirements would be concluded here, so it's not an additional burden on those facilities, but shines a light on the practice and with that, we do have some witnesses in support, and I request your aye vote. Thank you.
1469	Stone	Mark	20	JQ5xKCGxzzk	127	137	Good, we do have quorum, I'll take a motion on SB 28. The motion is do pass. We have a motion, and a second. Would you call the roll, please?
1470	Ting	Philip	30	j_YjnTPR-gU	824	843	We think by really creating that consumer incentive is a huge move in that right direction. I have here two witnesses, Matt Freedman from TURN and I don't see, just coming oh, Matt Freedman from TURN. Okay.
1471	Wieckowski	Bob	55	x3NT_O3KYOQ	727	740	That sort of helps you narrow what your day in court's gonna look like rather than, we'll hide the ball and go in there guns ablazing in the traditional model.
1472	De Leon	Kevin	102	oE98JCD72Xk	508	536	This is your first year. So this is the first time you've had understandably, for a variety of folks here too, Democrats and Republicans alike, a major bill at this scale with regards to carbon and most likely because our need to reduce harmful carbon emissions, there will probably be many more measures coming down the pipeline on both sides.
1473	Wood	Jim	72	Bf9_WjQyNCc	784	817	Okay. Is there any process by which providers can have input on that to cross tabulate? And the reason I ask is I've heard anecdotally that there are denials of authorization is from some plans for certain procedures and things, and providers are a ittle fresh frustrated by that so, I'm curious is there a process by which, you know, providers can be engaged in the process so that, basically to know that the data is correct.
1474	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	OVIQdDmHNzI	1918	1940	I wanna thank you too for, I mean, I would much rather not have had to gut and amend a bill, but we had this oil spill. No one expected it, no one wanted it, no one still wants it. But I think that we have been working, and I want to again thank the committee, I think the amendments are very positive, I'd like the opposition or those who are uncertain to take a look.
1475	Irwin	Jacqui	16	ElqG9zhDxtM	73	85	This will require that CVSO's justify the increased spending and ensure that changes are made to target under served populations or to adjust to the changing needs of California veterans.
1476	Eggman	Susan Talamantes	73	mRtWZWKaAFE	1032	1046	Thank you, I apologize, I missed a lot of the conversation. I'd like to say I'm sorry. I missed a lot of the conversation. And I expressed some of my concerns to the author. And a lot of them were resolved with the DOJ.
1477	Mathis	Devon	75	pyW7Y47fazc	1120	1146	So he applies, he goes through a two year course, and at the end of the day, it's not accredited for anything. He's got a piece of paper that's got his name on it that says college degree and then he decides a year later, "You know what? I'm gonna better myself and I want to go to a university". And now he's gotta retake two years worth of courses. So what is there a safeguard, or is there?
1478	McCarty	Kevin	22	XYWDulv6x4s	643	658	So, we're gonna hold this issue open, before we proceed with the other CSU items, there's some people, committee members have to leave, so we're going to briefly go to the California State Library, issue number five.
1479	Gatto	Mike	46	UdyJhNk-vh8	1059	1069	Thank you very much. The motion which has moved by Mr. Dahle, seconded I believe by Mr. Calderon, it's do passed to appropriations. Madame Secretary, please call the roll.
1480	Bonta	Rob	85	58ODc-fO4Eo	327	344	So, building on the different layers, I think, can really help make robust the tools that we have to address poverty, so I just want to thank the administration for this contribution. So, it must be nice to be getting thanks right at the start of the tax season.
1481	Wood	Jim	72	jKVkIx_af_k	1451	1466	In addition to illegal water diversions, we are seeing unpermitted land grading and road construction, discharge of sediments into streams, pollutants into waterways, as well as contamination of Water and soil by pesticides, rodenticides, fertilizers and fuels.
1482	Nielsen	Jim	68	07ilphfHuEw	699	716	I'm convinced that their levels are too low and that's not something you often hear me say about state employees. But, I was talking to some folks about that this afternoon and I know who those scientists are and I've worked with them and I know what they do
1483	Hueso	Ben	48	Q5Q2oc0ttio	134	160	The passage of the Federal Powers Act rendered the provision unconstitutional. And, because there is a provision currently in the books that conflict with federal code, this could raise an environment of litigation if anybody either curtailed geothermal or actually began to work with geothermal.
1484	Nielsen	Jim	68	07ilphfHuEw	669	686	And sadly, state government has not really changed. In fact, state government has only gotten more powerful. In parts of the additional employees, but mostly because of authorities accorded by the Legislature.
1485	Hill	Jerry	66	OaKXojP7k_0	159	181	Thank you, Madame President and members. AB1153 extends for one year the sunset date for the centralization determination of the fair market value and taxation of a certificate aircraft. Although the current lead county framework has worked for the past decade, there are several fundamental problems of California Assessors Association and the airline industry would like to address such a centralized assessments, decreasing administrative burdens and proper methodology to evaluate aircraft.
1486	Rendon	Anthony	120	hrVBNy8V670	194	205	Your committee analysis identifies general concerns. Those are concerns that we will need to address in the months a head. Is this bill done? No, but that's a legislative process.
1487	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	rek1UfAle3c	575	590	Whether in times of state budget shortfalls or surpluses, our selfless teachers face the ever-present need to sup, supplement classroom learning at personal costs because they want to make sure their students have what they need to succeed.
1488	Hill	Jerry	66	kj6ztr1oPBg	811	830	All 49 other states use the federal all or virtually all labeling standard, which allows a small amount of flexibility, so companies can use an insignificant amount of foreign content. This is important in today's global economy in which certain components cannot be found in the United States.
1489	Mitchell	Holly	64	9CiJIuh6qrU	1825	1851	And B, needing to acknowledge that there are some communities that are disproportionately impacted and if we find ourselves in a position where we have to prioritize increases back into the system that might having that information seems to me might be useful in terms of trying to target re investment in aspects of the overall department program that took the disproportionate hit.
1490	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	rek1UfAle3c	590	608	For new teachers, in particular, their out of pockets expenses can be quite a hardship, especially in relation to their salary which is at the lowest end of the pay cycle, yet they willingly incur these costs to create an engaging curriculum and gather the crucial resources and materials instructed.
1491	Liu	Carol	63	PFemgtd0i88	1312	1332	on page 12 indicates the POST is in the process of examining mental health training courses, etc. You're in the process, or they are in the process. Is there... results could happen soon? Is there going to be a report that might be helpful to this discussion?
1492	Atkins	Toni	110	r1PhXBRe6ug	497	512	I know that many of us are going to go home this weekend and we're going to spend Monday going to the breakfast, where we will get more inspiration and inspired to come back and do the work that we do every single-day up here.
1493	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	OVIQdDmHNzI	169	192	Because if you wait until the process is over and then request that the record be prepared, it can take anywhere from six months to a year. So at the discretion of the applicant, they can say, we know there's gonna be trouble, and we would like you, whoever is the party that's going to be doing the record, to prepare it now.
1494	Cooley	Ken	45	t7euJl-cRys	1705	1737	Yeah and do you know. And in the Judicial Council they do an annual report. They boil out, distill out a lot of data on how our court systems operate. Do you know if the dependency counsel numbers are a part of the annual report or is this sort of like a special data call or analysis. And if you don't know the answer, I'm just curious.
1495	De Leon	Kevin	102	fdbxd6pnPrg	1750	1772	And women. And I'm happy to entertain your confirmation today. So why don't we get to those who are in support of todays nominee. Those in support, come on up. Seeing none right now. Those in opposition. Anyone in opposition? Same. Anyone who's agnostic about Mr. Supple. Seeing no one, can I entertain a motion?
1496	Bonilla	Susan	3	92Qm5msEnYk	1095	1109	You can't just have committees and then not have them ever meet and of course you're gonna then generate complaints from the people who want their issues heard more than in the last few minutes of a regular meeting. So what is the hold up? Why aren't these committees meeting?
1497	Salas	Rudy	34	fmIaR7hDQ6w	1109	1130	Was, for residents in apartments where they don't have a plan, how to get water, so whether you're in Tulare County or Ventura County, you know, you guys are on the ground. What are you seeing that's being done, and we talked about relocation earlier in the previous panel but, what are you seeing being done?
1498	Dodd	Bill	71	9CBpVwqHDr0	1603	1618	Yes, Assembly Member Levine, is there any that you know of obligations or liabilities that pass off to the State of California from MTC if this bill passes? That otherwise wouldn't be there.
1499	Hertzberg	Robert	99	1tbz59-ST4g	1269	1289	If you drive a Rolls Royce, your vehicle license fee is more expensive than if you drive a $300 jalopy. The idea of a $35 fee is the same person with a $500 car versus a $500,000 car pays the same fee. So as we begin to look at our public policy, we balance out this issue. And I agree,
1500	Weber	Shirley	44	vjC4sV_362o	1004	1025	So while we have come a mighty long way, we have much to do and great challenges to champion. 164 years ago, a woman by the name of Sojourner Truth, Isabella a former enslaved American presented her "ain't I a woman" presentation before the women's convention in Akron Ohio.
1501	Cooper	Jim	21	V2DWmVVPp4I	57	67	For those state task forces and ones here at McClellan and CHP's embedded in there, FBI's embedded in there, and when you're sitting there working together in the same office, dealing with the same issues- that's what helps.
1502	Kim	Young	82	SaBiGmhdX4s	191	217	This overview of the California economy is very, very timely. Unfortunately however, we still have the nation's 3rd largest unemployment rate at 7.1%, which is higher than the national average of 5.5%, and many of us know that California consistently ranks at the bottom as a business-friendly states because of our high business tax climate.
1503	Fuller	Jean	49	xL36G7ytN6U	1256	1278	Purpose of thank you and introduction. I have with me Cheryl Mclaughlin she'd been my scheduler since the very first day. She's made my life wonderful, she's been in the building for many years and this is her last day
1504	Hall	Isadore	1	-zapzAXTnLg	1060	1083	in supporting SJR 2. A resolution, but I pray, that you too will stand united with me when we vote yes for this comprehensive immigration package that is coming through this House in just a few weeks. And, on that members, Senators I also stand in support of SJR 2.
1505	Allen	Benjamin	70	zaVlsvC4ABg	205	217	A number of us Alex and but I've been talking to folks from Ferencia, Sao, and getting reports from other states, but I'd love to hear the panel's thoughts on, you're all experts in this area.
1506	Wieckowski	Bob	55	gZ0_qo7XpYk	2281	2296	What you're-- The intent here for the bill is that we want you to look at this every five years, whether you want to or not. And tell us on these new plants how we can further reduce the greenhouse gases. Is that?
1507	Stone	Mark	20	leLv2BAfLGY	1198	1221	And there's a lot of squeaking going on on this committee and I'm, again, just delighted to work with these two professionals that see from your vantage point how important the restoration of this funding is. And I look forward to working cooperatively with our staff and my colleagues to effectuate the same.
1508	Brown	Cheryl	13	NYGfzZLGLck	1474	1486	That's because Chief Jones is just that kind of person that thinks that's really important so that he can get his citizens back on track. I think the more we can do to help, the better it'll be.
1509	Pan	Richard	96	YFmVbaB_4iY	501	520	This is the proof of why SB 277 is needed to protect the public from vaccine preventable contagions. SB 277 is also needed to protect our most vulnerable citizens. Vaccine preventable infections are particularly dangerous to people with cancer, transplants, and other immune disorders.
1510	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	tEhMYBdIqkE	357	381	And I know it was under very harsh and trying times because there were laws that were brought before this Committee. Mr. Sumner, Ms. Krell, where you're sitting now, we had legislators that pleaded with us to move ahead with legislation that we knew would not fully address the problem. And he had the courage to say let's look at this comprehensively and that's difficult,
1511	Cannella	Anthony	61	_3f-5R48ZaU	566	579	But I did want to correct, you mentioned the Speaker's plan and Chairman Beall's plan, but we also had an Assembly Republican plan and a Senate Republican plan as well, that was out there. Hopefully, you liked components from that as well. So I think that that's a good starting point.And then it was mentioned-
1512	Rodriguez	Freddie	69	j_cwUXYUJzk	480	495	The City of San Bernardino Police Department received a call about 11:00 p.m. that night, but due to her inability to talk on her exact location it took the police department over 20 minutes to locate her by the longitude and latitude information that was given.
1513	Nazarian	Adrin	36	leAiZf7wn9s	58	72	Individuals over the age of 18 who are added to CalGang and individuals of any age including minors added to other local databases have no legal right to be notified and have no opportunity to appeal their designation.
1514	Mendoza	Tony	52	EWFYx7q92DQ	1344	1369	They are one of the most overly regulated industries in our state and provide a lot of safeguards to consumers within our state. And to allow them the opportunity to provide these transactions without the thumbprint and actually allowing them to send those monies to the individual's bank accounts will only allow outside customers but
1515	Santiago	Miguel	17	UonYQneKEjk	934	948	Thank you, Mr speaker and members. AB 1102 will allow an individual, in this case specifically a woman, to enroll in a health insurance outside of the enrollment period, by making pregnancy a life trigger event and a special enrollment for the ACA.
1516	Kim	Young	82	l3Ffe0dfTvk	97	119	you know, base salary. You know, in terms of defining the pension plan. So, as the chairman mentioned, I would be more comfortable going forward if we could get some commitment that you will go ahead and adopt the the states reform to determine the base. Okay. Thank you.
1517	Pavley	Fran	104	yzBzen_uFsA	1038	1074	It's an economic bill. And for California to be relatively independent as far as the economic uncertainties that plague other parts of the state have been to our benefit. Cars are example, mobile sources number one sources of pollution in 2002. No one said we could manufacture all these different cars. American automobile makers couldn't compete with foreign. Look at the broad choices you have today. Now it's a national standard. The average will be, by 2025, 54 miles per gallon, over a fleet average.
1518	Alejo	Luis	9	Idhs0np0fh0	24	51	Good afternoon Mr Chair and members. I'm here to present AB 865, but before we begin I would like to thank the committee staff for their hard work on this bill. AB865 power of California act will drive clean energy investments in underserved communities. This bill will require the California energy commission to develop an outreach program to inform an increased engagement with women, minority,disabled veteran and LGBT own business enterprises.
1519	Garcia	Eduardo	38	qrJj2d7lUww	411	423	AB 185 establishes a tax rate to help attract new private capital In very low income neighborhoods. The credit is funded through the Reallocation and Underutilized Business Incentive at the Treasurer's Office.
1520	Mitchell	Holly	64	zKRXexcG8LM	210	230	The bill goes into specifics, it talks about updating the JB 220 court form. Again, we're requiring record-keeping, the development of data, monthly data reports, between these two state agencies who have to oversight over the well-being of these children. With that, I ask for your aye vote.
1521	Weber	Shirley	44	vjC4sV_362o	1486	1499	Does my sexiness upset you? Does it come as a surprise that I dance like I've got diamonds at the meeting of my thighs? Out of the huts of history shame, I rise. Up from a passage rooted in pain, I rise.
1522	Thurmond	Tony	4	2b3SgDbb8jI	1860	1875	And has now been identified as an area that will be rebuilt and redeveloped. This area will have a number of developments, shops, and housing, waterfront related development. It will have a very important addition, UC Berkley would like to launch a new campus there.
1523	Garcia	Eduardo	38	GUxOzh3Wh0Q	47	66	This bill is a measure that will help ensure a reliable and a low carbon grid for Californians by requiring the Public Utilities Commission to consider best fit attributes of renewable energy resources and greenhouse gas emissions when considering renewable energy bids to comply with the renewable portfolio standard.
1524	Eggman	Susan Talamantes	73	kf7nMeFz9oY	431	448	How do we take trash and make it into jobs for people to be able to get back to work, and work to save the environment at the same time? And Mr. Chair, I understand that you have been working diligently on finding ways to audit tax credits, to ensure that they are not a give-away, and we think this bill is a prototype for that kind of thing.
1525	Hernandez	Ed	103	BDjsPtF4Upk	1711	1730	But, here's the hat I have to put on today as chair of this Health Committee, that is protecting the consumer and in the hearing and a little bit of what we heard today is all about contracting, and we are leaving out the consumer, and that is the ultimate goal of this bill.
1526	Maienschein	Brian	84	KpERIVYvrj0	827	841	Thank you. Any other witnesses in support? Witnesses in opposition? Seeing none, questions or comments from the committee? See none, we have a motion and a second. Mr. Rendon, you may close.
1527	Bloom	Richard	2	2IKoCnJyE-g	1026	1039	Simply put, the monies collected through the fee will go directly back into the community to address the health impacts of over-consumption of sugar with a heavy priority given to prevention.
1528	Leno	Mark	60	MPEe2Ccro74	169	197	So that those who are earning modest salaries are paying not the same tax rate is those who are earning 200, 500,000 a million or $10 million a year. It's called graduated tax, a progressive tax. It works, it makes sense. We need a little bit more money to make this program whole. I ask for you aye vote.
1529	McGuire	Mike	93	zKRXexcG8LM	1340	1355	14 cases in '12 and it's been increasing ever since and between 2010 and 2014, we've seen 106 incidents in redwood state and national parks where taxpayers spent over $1 billion to be able to preserve.
1530	Williams	Das	12	rpVWOZ1bEow	1363	1394	Since you've returned to your confidence about the detention of fracking operations within the site, and associated chemicals within the site.  How can you be so confident? I have a lot of sympathy for you. I wanted to give a congratulations to Dr. Bunn for his position and I want to reiterate my condolences to Dr. Bohlen for his position.
1531	Thurmond	Tony	4	VixXoFAwUIs	789	813	Thank you Mr. Chair. I just want to add context. We've had, in the Budget Subcommittee on Health and Human Services, we've had rigorous discussion about the kind of problems that occur when these inspections do not occur on a regular basis and tomorrow we're having a continuation of that discussion specifically with community care licensing to hear further discussion about the need for the annual inspections.
1532	Dahle	Brian	47	v8Lqd5JpuF0	466	476	when the forest was growing back we then suppressed fire through the Smokey the Bear campaign for about 80 years. And what we have now is a forest that's not resilient to fire.
1533	Gipson	Mike	28	dfinQbvsuZo	262	279	AB 920 will provide victims equal access to information at parole hearing. Prior to each parole hearing, the parole board, the district attorney, and the inmates attorney, all are provided packet of information regarding the inmates incarceration.
1534	Pavley	Fran	104	xG-KiREcweY	334	363	Yeah, just a comment or two. I don't know if the timing is appropriate but we don't feel like we have the more specific information and justification for going up to $5 million. Obviously we want it disposed of and not half of it left in the state. So if there is time before it goes forward to look at that for
1535	Hertzberg	Robert	99	OXbgpLHoC3w	1367	1376	We can create big, huge systems. Grabbing the hyperion water, doing what Orange County does and dramatically deal with that. The environmental piece is huge, no question. It's harder to finance.
1536	Nielsen	Jim	68	fPXDsUW3HWg	379	401	Being rammed through at the last minute with no public input. Now, what citizens are out here, some special interests have shown up, thank goodness. But the average citizens that we represent, and I assure you that when the well police start coming around, and $500 and $10,000 fines start getting meted out.
1537	Monning	Bill	25	3ozy7hrhoXs	1111	1127	So that provides us some assurance, because in past years, as you know, we've been asked to support extensions so that we don't lose hospital services, particularly in a rural area.
1538	Moorlach	John	4657	vuTgADMvFlA	1346	1361	Okay. And, coming from counties, the next question on your page 13, you have the implementation of anti fraud activities, and as a former supervisor, IHS almost seemed wrought with fraud.
1539	Mitchell	Holly	64	nVE2-FVOyaQ	0	21	Being probably one that suffers from a similar thing in that we're trying to make sure it's tight before we do that. I appreciate that. I just think as we talk about culture shift and making sure you're building positive, healthy relationships with the legislatures, because we get prickly.
1540	Grove	Shannon	77	Ve6b2OIjftM	775	799	I have the language for the VBR in front of me. And I just need someone, anyone, either the sponsor of the secretary of state's office, the registrar of voters office, anyone on the committee. What's not clear about, you have the right to cast a ballot, if you are a valid registered voter?
1541	Hernandez	Roger	37	nJsCwYpjBcE	42	56	I look forward to supporting those efforts. The police shooting of innocent men of color is completely unacceptable, and I would argue to this Committee, so is the targeting of law-enforcement officials. Our constitution protects freedom of speech, yet it does not protect hate speech.
1542	Block	Marty	59	eHKo1SK8Zvs	724	734	And maybe, the similar data points in those programs. I know last year. I believe we allocated $2 million for a museum of tolerance training, professional development. Are you familiar with that program?
1543	Hueso	Ben	48	uAWOk1QkKOw	1073	1091	So we have really defined the scope of the bill for buildings generally. We feel confident because I'm from San Diego and wherever I go, whether it's at the government level, that these have been successfully introduced to government buildings.
1544	Patterson	Jim	119	eYvHQ6iO6CE	2288	2306	I think I do agree with Member Wood, that I do think that regionalizaition on emergency kind of things like this as really, really very important. Emergencies don't know where the county boundaries start and end. I appreciate the fact that you're willing to work as this goes forward, and so I'll be a vote for it.
1545	Mullin	Kevin	31	PZ5qNcZ4hzo	397	407	With that the clerk will open the roll. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote.
1546	Obernolte	Jay	86	GSFM9WIHPWo	1343	1352	And as you know, that was released in fall of 2013 and then there was an update the fall of 2014 and they had sixteen recommendations for you to fix those flaws.
1547	Wilk	Scott	19	1hAzPTMXg3M	1509	1534	And the average park visit generates $57.63 including $24.63 inside state parks and nearby communities. This measure just also serves an important role for those veterans who use nature as a therapeutic remedy, which happens quite often. And AB 240 would allow those veterans to take advantage of our beautiful state parks to heal physically and emotionally.
1548	Fuller	Jean	49	6Zm0lSVJfAE	206	226	and I'm excited about that and I think that Mr. Avalos, I think you are self-explanatory since I know that program, that's a great program at Kern Community College and I liked that you said that you'd been to Saddleback
1549	Roth	Richard	106	5fo5PJ1KCp4	2052	2069	Thank you, Mr Chair. I just want to, as you know, since at least the mid 60s, if not before, the civil rights laws have prohibited both intentional and unintentional discrimination, pattern and practice, both of which, of course, are wrong.
1550	Maienschein	Brian	84	va2JElQwc4I	1296	1313	This has led to family members and other interested parties, who have been denied access to even the initial stages of LPS proceedings, to pursue dementia powers in their existing probate conservatorships. These powers include far fewer protections for the conservatee and extend greater authority to the conservator.
1551	Pavley	Fran	104	CoCqxpnnd8w	1774	1804	That would be a great idea. Okay. And the amendments for the committee member, is on page two in the analysis. Just because a part of your project is disadvantaged and the rest isn't you can't qualify in a total as a disadvantaged community. So those amendments were taken and with that I don't believe there is any, well there is some opposition to the bills. But not with those amendments.
1552	Monning	Bill	25	ho-PTBXT9zU	233	269	Defiance, exactly. And so, up the prescriptions, take away privileges of television or computer access, whatever. It sounds more like an incarceration situation than a caring home site that's helping someone out. Obviously, resources area huge problem in this, but one of my questions related to this ongoing work to better understand reporting and sharing of data, et cetera.
1553	Thurmond	Tony	4	eLkMhyjfqgI	1525	1541	You said in your presentation that many recipients are at a 100 percent of the poverty levels and, in some cases even more disastrous levels. That a person can't manage on what is provided right now for S-S-I/S-S-P.
1554	Wood	Jim	72	RK37B-MMwt0	981	1007	AB320 adds environmental engineers to the list of professional engineers within the professional engineers act. The bill provides a pathway to licensure for a person that wants to specifically be an environmental engineer. A separate title is needed because environmental engineers carry out tasks specific to soil science, chemistry and biology solving environmental problems by using their knowledge of engineering, pollution control, recycling, and public health issues.
1555	Hertzberg	Robert	99	VHKwUGu3F0g	1509	1526	San Fernando Valley that I live in is exactly the same size with the same population as the San Gabriel Valley that Senator Hernandez represents. And we have a handful of representatives, 275,000 people, and he's got a much better government, so they can go and grab and scream at the mayor in the supermarket.
1556	Stone	Jeff	26	y23O4kWOpz4	483	504	Why is it coming to a head now and not addressed then? I would prefer to wait until we get this work plan with the USEPA. Let's see if it's gonna work. Well, my hope is that it is. Our Governor seems to be supporting this.
1557	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	kMP7GilTLLE	978	1004	Okay. Mr. Chair, members, this is the last bill of the day. I want to thank everyone for their indulgence. This is Senate Bill 570, a bill that will improve the readability and clarity of the notices that are sent to California residents whenever their personal information is thought to have been stolen in a data breach.
1558	Lara	Ricardo	107	ptq5V1Fu0ok	70	92	Thank you. Comments or questions from Committee? Hearing none, without objection, we will move this item to the suspense file. Now we move to our, I'm sure everybody was waiting on this bill so you guys are good. Anybody needs to leave I won't be offended.
1559	Chiu	David	7	0pvN33z5LJg	1478	1495	You know, we can talk, for example, about Hepatitis C and the $1,000 per day, $84,000 per year treatment that has blown up our budget by $300 million just for one pill. If we had that money we could back fill all of the recent cuts to Medi-Cal.
1560	Lara	Ricardo	107	bxDlgoZu0KI	3	26	Thank you. Next, I believe we skipped over Senator Fuller. I'm so sorry. Ms Senator Fuller if you have you have three items. SB 115, 506 and 526. We will begin, they're all candidates for suspense. We'll begin with SB115.
1561	Achadjian	K.H. "Katcho"	5	Qd8yv7EufE4	1455	1476	It only requires a permission from a parent. Mr. Frazier, thank you. Like Mr. Medina, I used to work with local highschool, where a program says every 50 minutes when one of the students taken out. It's very touching. And this worries up the pain for the parents. They don't have to explain, they'll just blame it on the law or on Mr. Frazier. With that, your closing remarks, sir.
1562	Wood	Jim	72	qzvpjn8Cr2Y	412	435	is probably a lot of the crux of the issue here that I don't think has really gotten enough play and that is the protocols and the ability, or the challenges, that nurse practitioners have in getting changes to those protocols. So my question is, to the authors, had you considered that?
1563	Alejo	Luis	9	xdTTK0YoutY	1263	1268	So I'm very proud to stand with my brother, Assembly member Bonta and it's time to do what's right and recognize Larry Itilong as the great leader he was in California.
1564	Hueso	Ben	48	9SvrzWegmgM	646	654	But generally, we're talking about in from one retailer to the next, you're seeing minor changes. We're talking about a cent, a half a cent, maybe two cents. How does that explain the-- I mean, to go from 44 to 16? That's a pretty big shift.
1565	Runner	Sharon	4656	Kg4hNcGh7pk	1282	1310	My son, my daughter, my grandkids. My favorite little grandson, the curly hair two-year-old there. Wave at grandma. So again, I look forward to working with each and every one of you to help California be a better place even than it is today. So thank you so much.
1566	Leno	Mark	60	mkixEOc2Tj4	199	210	So, the smoke free act will prohibit the use, and it doesn't ban e-cigarettes, so anyone who suggests we're trying to ban them is just incorrect. It will just merely limit where they can be used.
1567	Bloom	Richard	2	Ai7oaVN8l2E	767	791	Thank you, and I just noticed a number of members of the conservation corps just walked in behind you, could you remind us of the unique provision that's being proposed that will hopefully facilitate some additional responsibilities for the conservation corps, if feasible?
1568	Galgiani	Cathleen	95	dOwUIOiNQpY	105	126	This has been a successful effort with over a 95% compliance rate. I have a number of supporters, including the business community, the treated wood industry, agriculture, the transportation sector, including ports and railroads and utilities who use treated wood, the building industry and the waste and recycling sector to name just a few.
1569	Moorlach	John	4657	4HKs3ChJG74	1172	1198	So, there were just a couple of thoughts as this progresses. One is how does the Senator and the Assemblyman Matt Harper stay involved so we can be updated on this project, but two, one of the concerns we have is moving everyone into group homes. We're using the term here community based services, but that
1570	Hernandez	Ed	103	o_iCJQqprWQ	1442	1457	I mean I think the provider group that I'm going to have the most sympathy with is going to be the E.R. docs because they have to deal from head-to-toe whereas at least in my case I'm just dealing with the eyes but it's still it's pretty onorous dealing with the ICD10. Then to add that this on top of that as well and
1571	Stone	Jeff	26	JT1Tm7zEIWc	995	1020	That's all right, I'm proud to say I'm in the drug business. But let me just say this, that you know, what I like to see is a lot of consensus. And what I'm seeing here today is there is not a lot of consensus with all these agricultural groups, car dealer groups that are opposed, and I agree with the concept of a safe harbor.
1572	Brown	Cheryl	13	CRMwg6_WO3E	115	154	Thank you, Mr. Chair. As chair of Aging and Long-term Care, I want to underscore the importance of this bill. It's very valuable for us to have a safe place to return once a person has been referred to a nursing home. They need their Independence. We need to do what we can for our seniors. This is an excellent bill and don't forget a thousand people a day or turning 65 and the silver salami is on its way.
1573	Anderson	Joel	57	hnhklV-igrA	1401	1436	Okay. So, my child is a lesser citizen and they have to go ahead and do all these, yet child patient zero, they are allowed to sashay through the school and expose other children. The problem I have with this is this bill doesn't address patient zero and if it addressed zero in a more thoughtful and thorough way, then the secondary argument of getting to vaccinating every child out there despite their religious belief is there.
1574	Allen	Benjamin	70	gafvxHeAnpk	316	330	I mean the article's quite substantial and gets into all of this haphazarding recording keeping and I just wanna get your thoughts on this article; I'm getting letters about it from people in my district.
1575	Stone	Mark	20	jpiCsnWb64Q	1637	1653	We will be reaching out and continuing the conversation. I am very interested in ways that we can drive the, this is hard, doing adaptation is difficult. In difficult areas it's easy to step back and just say well, we'll wait or we're just not going to take the difficult steps now.
1576	Rendon	Anthony	120	bgIZ8epTm-I	1653	1663	Thank you. I know there's a lot of people that want to speak on this bill. If we could have the witnesses limit their comments to two minutes. Your great?
1577	Roth	Richard	106	qIsKWbokTQE	431	448	Well I'm obviously gonna support this as well. I do have some concerns, when we create a title, Certified California Veterans Service Provider, we're as a state, somebody's giving a good housekeeping seal of approval to these organizations.
1578	Hertzberg	Robert	99	_QWOBYYvqfo	785	794	You know it sounds good and look I'm all for this stuff, but I just think we, you know, this is the legislature. We have to put ourselves to the toughest test and ask the toughest questions.
1579	Mayes	Chad	79	xnlrOV-AGaQ	213	230	I know you also talked about a document that'll be done here at the end of this month, is my understanding. Are we beginning to rally around one course of action that this is going to the plan to make the Salton Sea an asset that's greater than its liabilities?
1580	Allen	Benjamin	70	AMsr7z9XU6U	369	387	For the purpose of this, we've been having this discussion about the reinjection of waste water. For the purpose of that discussion, let's say the Montebello line, what would the salinity level be considered for the purposes of legal reinjection?
1581	Alejo	Luis	9	uggbUvzVWb8	106	124	employees to become superintendents and the quality of our schools' superintendents will decrease. However, by working with the opposition and having discussion with ACSA and CSBA, I believe that having a year's worth of pay is more than enough of a package to cover various costs.
1582	Gomez	Jimmy	80	QXW5aikdMmE	391	407	AB 954, Mathis, water and wastewater loan and grants, due pass with amendments to streamline the provisions, add an urgency clause and reduce the general fund of perspirations to ten million dollars. A roll call. AB 965, E. Garcia, New River, do pass. A roll call.
1583	Cooper	Jim	21	nqF3kpXMpbA	127	134	And I'm seven months removed from being out there 30 years. That's where the bottom line until that changes. And we have not had the discussion how to change that.
1584	Bigelow	Frank	91	3u2iEKilpPI	1681	1697	I would say chipping away is a good way to characterize it for a behemoth issue that's growing and growing and a liability that maybe some day bit us very severely if we don't address it. So thank you Madame Chair for the opportunity to discuss this.
1585	Wolk	Lois	94	D2hWZq64n8Q	95	120	delivering the water directly to export facilities in the South Delta. The tunnels project is the most expensive and controversial infrastructure proposal in California history. After nearly six years of study, and $200 million later spent on analyses, many of the basic questions about the tunnels project have yet to be answered.
1586	Bonta	Rob	85	OACKM5KF8Sk	1255	1289	Thank you that's very helpful. Another question, if I may Mr. Chair? Among the different recommendations you got a response from the DHCS, and there was some discussion about timelines for implementation on the recommendations about which DHCS agreed where appropriate steps to take.  In your view can any of the recommendations presented in the audit be implemented faster than DHCS has indicated?
1587	Levine	Marc	8	nsi_dMaCc9g	961	974	Thank you. Is there any opposition? Seeing none. We'll take it back to the committee. Any members have any comments? All right. Thank you. There is a motion. Would you like to close?
1588	Patterson	Jim	119	-Y7u0vZ_OFQ	1166	1178	Not withstanding the concerns that have been raised over the fact that it simply does not mitigate it's emissions footprint for 30 years. Doesn't this auto-pilot effect, exacerbate the concerns?
1589	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	XG9g8L3IwGU	357	371	I have Professor Gregory McNeal from Pepperdine Law School and Samantha Corbin from the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse here today to testify in support of the bill and help answer any technical questions that you might have.
1590	Chiu	David	7	1ULf869aoVg	1916	1935	Mr. Bloom has asked the first roll to be open for co-authors for this tough vote. The clerk will open the roll. Members, this is for co-authors. Members, this is for co-authors. The clerk will close the roll.
1591	Beall	Jim	92	C-wEOGkVqSc	6	35	of Transportation Housing Committee. You know, I went to a movie this weekend they said, "turn off the cellphones", I want you guys to do that. Fast and Furious 7. That was pretty good. I don't know, Transportation Committee. Well, my grandson liked it. Anyway, if you're going to have conversations, leave.
1592	Beall	Jim	92	P7DWk5t_5hU	489	509	But once they approve that, our job is to help them make those projects become a reality as quick and as fast as we can possibly do, so that's my commitment, if the voters of Los Angeles are wise enough to approve the measure, that's what I'm committed to doing, is to make these projects happen.
1593	Pavley	Fran	104	3CsrxcXxpcI	604	637	Item number four. We'll give them just about one minute to get a whole bunch of people out of the room. Just so you know, the young adults that were up here from Los Angeles, MRCA, they had them do sort of a sleepover at a park near the airport, so that they would all get on the plane together at some 7 AM hour or something like that.
1594	Bonilla	Susan	3	llrxaJMn6L0	733	746	But that's the only, it's not a regulatory board, but it is a review board. And maybe we can come back and explain briefly the role and the constitution of an IRB.
1595	Stone	Mark	20	rb93slzi3ec	1663	1698	The bill does allow probation to open the records to make sure that the placements are appropriate. And again, what's being sealed are the records with respect to the case, the crime that was committed, not all the other records where that child has touched any other agency. Those are available. And so if that child does come back into the juvenile justice system, it will be a little bit more difficult because the prosecutor will have to go to CPS or the other agencies to find out the status.
1596	Mendoza	Tony	52	IO307YMxf6Q	1919	1938	I do believe it will be leveling the playing field, allowing more opportunities for people to apply without having to be worried about not getting paid adequately. The father of three girls, I see where this could benefit me and my family personally.
1597	Atkins	Toni	110	lKgPPhMwBGU	931	961	It continues that demand and when you look at two of the most populous states, New York and California, with the highest demand, of course it has an impact.  So, on some of the issues they raise I'm happy to talk a little bit about, how I think we can continue to work forward, but the demand issue is what's driving the poaching and the killing of these animals in order to get that product here in the United States.
1598	Gatto	Mike	46	N6EhWxD1_nY	131	143	So for the most dangerous cleaners, some of the witnesses talked about trying to preserve, wearing a face mask. And a lot of the things that we've focused on in the last couple of minutes have been allergens.
1599	Lara	Ricardo	107	PFn_-ARbOZU	148	165	So again, I think we're splitting hairs, but I think the important thing, as we know is to provide comprehensive healthcare. Whether we like it or not, these folks are here, and they're contributing to our economy. And we need to do a better job to keep them healthy. So with that, so, I just wanted to say that.
1600	Jones	Brian	42	hlltK4ejvk4	68	131	Our colleague from Santa Barbara gave a very compelling reason for not supporting it. Is it the duty of us? Is it the duty of the state to ratify this decisions? We had speakers opposed to the bill talk about being historic and ladies and gentlemen this is a historic bill. And I would ask that you have this perspective as you are deciding what button to push. I know many of us came on the floor this morning fully aware of the decision we were going to make, yes or no. Some of us come on the floor still undecided maybe still be undecided and just waiting for that last moment to push the red button or the green button.
1601	Huff	Bob	105	g08jZJwUVEs	775	790	We don't say, "Have you got your 27 vaccines," or whatever it is, before they come and go to Disneyland, or any other place. And so, you're requiring our own parents to jump through hoops to do all these things in the interest of public health; and yet, we're still exposed.
1602	Gatto	Mike	46	toyLEHK5bMU	351	369	Department of Finance offered a compromise. They said we knew you beat us in court, we owe you 45 million but guess what, we'll redefine it and you're going to get 6 million. What a great compromise, right? Glendale has to write-off $9 million, I'm sorry $38 million, fire 25 police officers, fire
1603	Wilk	Scott	19	7UN1Ta_jlck	692	716	Thank you, I figured you didn't, because your predecessor was Dan Logue, and the way that he handled flood control, is he just wore pants up to here. In fact, that's a much more fiscally prudent way to handle this issue than the way you're doing it robbing money from the general fund. I urge a no vote on this bill.
1604	Hill	Jerry	66	Q0YUSKbr_v0	705	725	The amendments make certain that that change also applies to e-cigarettes. Last week, this committee voted to pass out Senator Leno's SB 140 which would define electronic cigarettes as tobacco. I share Senator Leno's concerns about the potential harm of e-cigarettes especially the increase of their use by children.
1605	Berryhill	Tom	54	9xlCmdTyLME	1309	1322	Great well listen, on my own time, I too think I'm going to lay off this bill today until we see it when it comes back because it's going to be probably a little bit different, I would imagine. Is this a final project?
1606	Beall	Jim	92	ckv1hzYbS0w	1560	1572	Sure. I would echo a lot of what Richard just said. You know, within AB118/AB8, we have 11 criteria that the legislature has asked us to look at including the cost-benefit score.
1607	Patterson	Jim	119	WPjNTeG9jTo	312	329	Under the minor violations program, regulated entities will have a chance to cure or to fix a minor violation when it is first noticed by an inspector, rather than be fined or issued a notice of violation on-the-spot.
1608	Wood	Jim	72	qMylnhtxSF8	37	67	How, and I've seen different numbers on this. How many actual adverse reactions are there really? And once again, I'm asking you a question, and in fairness, I probably should have asked you this in advance so that you knew where I might go, but I frankly, I didn't know I was going there. So, I'm just trying to get a scope of, versus the number of vaccinations, how many, what the percentage of adverse reactions are, and do you have any sort of a handle on that?
1609	Alejo	Luis	9	OqtPmd4MeNE	1805	1823	And, and Mr. Chairman, this was the very question in our analysis by our committee staff, so, but it is a serious issue. And and certainly communities have dealt with this. You know, it's very hard to deal with. It's very expensive for landlords. And it seems to be a growing problem.
1610	Gomez	Jimmy	80	22lWaj2Ih1o	1850	1873	It appropriates $517,255 from the general fund and $517,255, from the Dungeness Crab account within the Fish and Game Preservation Fund to the Department of Justice to pay the Marley vs McMannon settlement. So, we're settling a lawsuit.
1611	Lara	Ricardo	107	tHDAU5JmwzE	603	620	Next item is SB 29, field office training: mental health. Do pass as amended for the author to make clarifying changes. Amend to reduce the field training requirement for instructors. Substitute to the roll call from SB 254 that was approved on a unanimous vote, from seven to zero.
1612	Mullin	Kevin	31	rOcxPrNyERc	1485	1514	Members. Ever so briefly back to motions and resolutions pursuant to Assembly role 77.2. I am re-referring AB 802 to the Utilities and Commerce Committee. Also pursuing to AR 77.2, re-referring file item number 4SB 548 to the Human Services Committee.
1613	Quirk	Bill	23	kU8vhPso-yk	2163	2180	His recent work includes multi-year projects to study consumer markets and use of plug-in vehicles. And his research is studying EV, electric vehicle and plug-in hybrid electric vehicle market development, driver use patterns,
1614	Mitchell	Holly	64	c3rIX9MpSXI	844	867	Then to take his license which complicates his ability to get to work everyday. And so she talked about, you know the overall frame being clear about support. And creating opportunities that enable a parent to provide the support. So, the last program you, you, you mentioned, the new program where you can, primarily for the unbanked.
1615	Stone	Mark	20	5cExo6Kc7gQ	1040	1058	Senator, I wanna thank you for bringing this forward. I think too often our systems are really more for the benefit of the system rather than the person the system's charged to take care of, and in the chemical restraints area that's fairly clear. There's enough evidence that the chemical restraints are used more for
1616	Holden	Chris	78	qBs9W23Am_w	2394	2403	in terms of looking at circumstances and allowing the courts to have an exemption. And so I think that it's a bill worth supporting, and I'm happy to do so.
1617	Gomez	Jimmy	80	u7ADTTDLP7s	244	258	So, I believe that my bill is one of the three legs of the stool that's necessary to create a robust and expansive and equitable paid family leave program.
1618	Mitchell	Holly	64	c3rIX9MpSXI	867	890	She cited an example of a truck driver who crossed the state lines who said he knew based on when his pay day fell and wherever he was in the state that he was always gonna be late. In an effort to try to get into an office. During traditional work time, nine to five, where people have to leave their jobs or whatever. So this new program and the, the, the billions, millions, millions it's. Brought in a relatively short period of time,
1619	Cooper	Jim	21	jc5QM_t6LKQ	9	20	So how many local agencies have taken over routing of those calls from CHP? Because in my city, Elk Grove, they took over the responsibility of calls, but how many agencies have done that in the state?
1620	Hill	Jerry	66	mCVaWE-xXHw	1182	1195	Thank you Senator Block. The question that Mister Valencia raised or the issue related to responsiveness and being able to make whatever comments someone would want before a decision is made. Is that going to be addressed?
1621	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	Gnpfbx52n0w	1515	1533	AB 1300 is the beginning of a legislative dialogue that we hope will modernize the system and ultimately improve the delivery of mental health services to those in critical, critical need. With that and your indulgence  Mr. Chair we have witnesses who would testify in merits of the proposal.
1622	Stone	Jeff	26	DiYo45O70Kw	1450	1467	So I assume that the legislature doesn't get into the minutiae of those details. We're just basically saying if we're gonna sell less than market value, we are gonna have lower rents for lower income folks that are going to be living there.
1623	Mullin	Kevin	31	_3f-5R48ZaU	1269	1281	We're already a donor state, California's a donor state, that's not a secret to anybody, but what kind of federal money, private money, can we leverage with the kinds of dollars we're contemplating on the dais here?
1624	Dababneh	Matthew	50	goLRzsDXvfE	1124	1140	Dear Mr Speaker, Collegaues, AB 221 will establish a feasibility study to help determine the best way to develop a digital driver's license app for smart phones. This bill will direct the DMV to report back their findings to this legislative body no later than December 1, 2016.
1625	Gallagher	James	108	f1-nJuHExxE	1494	1508	And at least in a conservatorship situation, we're at the very least saying that this person is unable to make decisions, and that's why they're being put under the conservatorship in the first place.
1626	Ting	Philip	30	6UU1hF1F-fc	1249	1274	We really do like our cab drivers, but unfortunately, there are frankly not enough of them in San Francisco or even in LA, there's very difficult times to actually get a cab. I live in the western part of San Francisco, and while the town was relatively small before many of these TNC options even came around, it was almost impossible to get any cab to pick me up at my house, to take me downtown or to go down or last time I was going to the airport.
1627	Fuller	Jean	49	WnmFSvHbO0k	230	241	school to another. It seems prudent to use this federal funding which is disappearing as other states draw down the fund and we may be left out. I ask for your aye vote.
1628	Weber	Shirley	44	FR5oPTw2QLM	1149	1169	But it definitely cuts the cost in terms of emergency rooms and emergency care for this amount of money. The 2 million is really miniscule in comparison to the cost of a person who has OD. Not only their life, but more importantly, if they remain alive for a period of time. The cost of emergency care is enormous.
1629	Hertzberg	Robert	99	wxAms1gWFJA	1633	1653	The purpose of this, right, if I'm correct is to build transportation systems, correct? Isn't it accurate to say that the state-- the analysts-- the state analyst indicates that there's a 76% economic feedback effect round numbers when you do construction jobs like this. Isn't there-- I understand you don't like any word that has that horrible three-letter word. I get that.
1630	Hueso	Ben	48	Idhs0np0fh0	1682	1704	So I wanna encourage a support for this measure, it's a good bill. I want to thank the author and I think the presentation was thorough and I think it had raised all of the concerns, and I think generally, we're privy to them. And I think overall, this is a good bill in defense of jobs. So, when we have a quorum, we will move this bill. Thank you.
1631	Pavley	Fran	104	uymj8kL8SYs	187	209	Alright. And with that so far we've heard Senator Nielsen, both of his bills Items three and items seven and we're moving on to I believe, sitting here Senator Morrell. This is file item eight. State responsibility areas, fire prevention fees. Senator Hertzberg I'm pointing out this is dual referred to governance and finance.
1632	Stone	Jeff	26	XCFU_0j8dAo	17	38	Good afternoon Mr. Chairman and honorable senators and staff. I know you've had a very long day and I'll try not to prolong it much longer, but thank you very much for the opportunity to present SB240, which is a simple bill that provides an exemption under CEQA for specific types of projects that are restorative in nature.
1633	Liu	Carol	63	ZozhIodyLFc	208	227	Without notification, the individuals and their families can easily lose track of these benefits, especially if the insured suffers from cognitive impairment. These individuals and families likely end up paying for care and doing without with, in fact, benefits are available.
1634	Bonta	Rob	85	9PxlbB74Usg	205	221	I look forward to the discussion here today and working with the Department and all stakeholders to find solutions we can implement this year that will correct these problems going forward and ensure that our children are provided with the high-quality dental care they deserve. Thank you.
1635	Fuller	Jean	49	oDMixRIfl_Y	433	456	Welcome. Well here we are again, and you aren't old and stooped over like I thought you'd be, Mr Picker, from having taken on close to a year of this. So we congratulate you for survival of the fittest, because it's a pretty tough place to be in. You've done a good job sitting there.
1636	Hertzberg	Robert	99	1-lHMg2FsZ4	1447	1455	What's the impact then of the Dutra bill? Remember we, was prop, was it 42 or 45 we passed years ago. We took the sales tax on gas and we added, what's been the impact on that?
1637	De Leon	Kevin	102	A4tFO9bb3f0	1389	1404	How many jobs were created? And then the energy efficiency space, I think members here are gonna wanna know was the majority invested on HVAC? Was it invested in double paned windows, fenestration?
1638	Patterson	Jim	119	P6cBeme--dw	1134	1176	The AMA's opinion 2.211 states this, "It is understandable, though tragic, that some patients in extreme duress such as those suffering from a terminal painful debilitating illness may come to decide that death is preferable to life. However, allowing physicians to participate in assisted suicide would cause more harm then good. Physician-assisted suicide is fundamentally incompatible with the physician's role as healer and would be difficult or impossible to control and would pose serious societal risks. And that's from the AMA.
1639	Dahle	Brian	47	uuwAxYppIw8	2183	2194	I'm trying to figure out what the amendments do or not do. And that's why I asked the question. I'm still unclear. If you do not have anything in place today, like, Oakland has something in place. Where they choose not.
1640	Brown	Cheryl	13	EWFYx7q92DQ	773	798	I'm coming into that age that we've been talking about, and one of the things that I did was put my thumbprint or my index fingerprint on this. Is there any reason why, if the thumbprint is the biggest issue, is there any reason why that can't be done remotely by your telephone?
1641	Lara	Ricardo	107	-Ah0Dbgfor4	2026	2044	SB 25, Local Gov VLF adjustment, property tax shift for newly incorporated cities. That's a do pass recommendation. Substitute the roll from SB 254. That bill is approved on a unanimous vote of seven to zero.
1642	Lara	Ricardo	107	yegxkcxS3po	1370	1388	and it's just all these fiefdoms that exist in this area, where there's no kind of standard, standardized set policy of how we're going to deliver a reliable source of water, an affordable water option for low-income residents which the majority of constituents in southeast LA county are.
1643	Mitchell	Holly	64	cjQHh7M-3yo	859	874	And so for finances, the Administration basically waiting for these kinds of metrics and analysis to determine whether or not you feel increasing the reimbursement rate is worthy? What are you waiting for?
1644	Wagner	Donald	88	0LdXFnPqPCk	2375	2411	I'd also like to extend birthday wishes to our great colleague Tom Lackey. I'll also note as youthful looking, but has much more experience than Mr. Salas at this.
1645	De Leon	Kevin	102	pmq1wDNXXkw	826	839	What CEC or CARB, you know, with 1275 the goal or the objective is to make sure that low income families, whether they're rural or whether they're urban areas, low income families have access to rebates
1646	Cannella	Anthony	61	iE2i4N-8BMc	2036	2050	Okay. Great. Thank you. So when we get back to normal precipitation, which hopefully is soon, do you believe the state can balance the water needs for 40 million people and the environment? If not, what do we have to do differently?
1647	Monning	Bill	25	Zk_K_zhn8-Q	294	315	But, if there's any shortcomings it seems to be felt, once again in the area of Health and Human Services and I know we'll be having full hearings on these in Sub 3. But with respect to developmental services and there are several sub categories there of course.
1648	Beall	Jim	92	zZ5dG3yEymQ	1180	1202	Well, I don't wanna take up too much of your time. I just wanna thank you for inviting me to come over, reciprocating our, we had a great hearing last week similar to this one. Just to emphasize, during this special session we're gonna all form as colleagues sort of the teamwork approach, we have to pull something together.
1649	De Leon	Kevin	102	pmq1wDNXXkw	809	826	So I think it's really critical that we still move forward and build upon 1275, another policy measures that are very similar, that really incentivize, if you will. One thing I wanted to add, something that is constructive.
1650	Maienschein	Brian	84	CVBfShlBh9U	1070	1090	Under current law, medically fragile children may receive day health and respite care services through MediCal at 1 of 16 licensed pediatric day health and respite care facilities. These facilities serve an estimated 300 individuals statewide. Under current laws, children may receive care through these facilities until the child turns 22 years of age.
1651	Baker	Catharine	74	N6EhWxD1_nY	488	496	As Mr. Mullin mentioned, this is a laundry list. And how is it going to be useful to consumers if we're not being smarter about the information that's actually out there?
1652	Williams	Das	12	2CIDVI97Hpk	601	639	So that's. I think that's the crux of what I get at, is. In the face of dwindling water resources, obviously, a part of us wants to reuse water, but the combination of the possible dangers of using water used in fracking operations for agricultural use.
1653	Beall	Jim	92	SK-C_51Liio	1083	1102	To clarify, that's with the understanding that Senator Leno's commitment, the mayor's commitment, to work on two issues outstanding are the inheritance issue and the small owner exemption through the judiciary committee at the next step.
1654	Garcia	Cristina	112	dAMeavSqnLk	464	482	Mr. Speaker and members. SB 501 creates a tiered garnishment rate, so that the more worker earns the more he repays. This bill will assist real hardworking people trying to break the cycle of debt and gain financial stability. We will cap the garnishment rate at 40,000 for workers in the state minimum wage locations, and 60,000 for workers in a higher minimum wage cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles.
1655	Allen	Benjamin	70	_4l4q_6Hap0	376	388	Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, Christy Bouma on behalf of the California Professional Firefighters. The author and sponsor said it well. We are pleased to be in support.
1656	Atkins	Toni	110	r1PhXBRe6ug	2067	2089	Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I join with my colleague to rise and adjourn in memory of Andrea Crouch, a man whose songs have resonated in churches around the globe, and in fact right here in this Assembly chamber. Last May when I was sworn in as speaker, I was surprised and very touched that Senator Holly Mitchell had arranged for a local choir to perform "Through it All," my favorite gospel song by my favorite gospel artist Andrae Crouch.
1657	Jones	Brian	42	VjN2j4PuSG8	1166	1179	Senator, you have a motion and a second. I know exactly how this goes. I respectfully, it's that senate, I tell you. Wait a minute, wait a minute. I respect fully ask for an aye vote.
1658	Beall	Jim	92	dKP_0hCwqBA	50	74	investments that we make in funding road maintenance backlogs. So I think the public wants to know how we can guarantee if we invest in these problems, they're actually gonna be invested in a wise manner. So we talk about life cycle investments and outcomes.
1659	Gallagher	James	108	Tqcxk8QJsXU	176	198	Mr. Speaker and members. I know this bill really took a lot of time to finally get here, a little bit of turmoil, but finally made it here to this floor. So I'm very appreciative to get here, but like a fine distilled beverage it takes a little time it takes a little age and now it's finally here for us. It's peanut butter jelly time. I urge your support for this important bill. Thank you.
1660	Eggman	Susan Talamantes	73	REI9w9xwFAI	1431	1455	It is not mandatory, it is for the people who got up and said, I'd like another choice. It is not mandatory, there is no conversion, coercion. It is one more option in the array of things that we can offer people when they are faced with a terminal diagnosis and are facing the end of their life. I don't know what else I can say besides that and I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
1661	Alejo	Luis	9	dAAyQzjyhS0	55	65	But, when we heard about the water shortage in East Porterville, we decided to see the situation for ourselves and take a look at the water supplies being provided to local residents.
1662	Monning	Bill	25	npLG8Ena6eQ	2459	2479	She sought this choice in her life and my colleague from San Francisco shared her very powerful quote. We're joined today by the memory and legacy of those who committed their remaining days to try to establish this right not for themselves because they knew their time was running out, but for others.
1663	Leno	Mark	60	8YNqtXYvNaM	639	649	Now, if we were to broaden this to include both trains and trucks do we have to switch from a fee to a tax, or could we still do it through a fee?
1664	Gomez	Jimmy	80	qrLFVDrXadw	14	29	Mister Chair, members, I would like to thank the chair and the committee consultant for the work and time spent working with the author's office on this bill. Quimby Fees have been a vital tool in helping cities create parks throughout the golden state.
1665	Hall	Isadore	1	XKugQ-1Kx3w	211	241	Right, any questions from the members? All right, any questions or comments from witnesses or folks in the audience? No? All right, I spoke to the Senator earlier and wanted to make sure that we're cleared, this is a spot bill pretty much. And we're moving this bill through. If this bill should morph into something else, we will see this bill again, right?
1666	Hancock	Loni	98	0XEmXVzSg6Q	1106	1133	I represent a large and thriving Vietnamese community. Many of them are personal friends of my family and I. They came over as boat people very much like Ms. Nguyen's family. They worked very hard. They did well in this country. They now are reconciled with the government of Vietnam.
1667	Stone	Jeff	26	DiYo45O70Kw	1541	1559	So is there any way when we do this request for proposal, I presume that we're going to have, is that we ensure that these other units that may not be destined at the time to be used by the developmentally disabled are constructed in such a way that they're portable?
1668	Hernandez	Ed	103	dPyMSgDnNQE	329	358	You know what I'm talking about, postponing, postponing, but now you have a drop deadline for October 1, and at some point you have to do it. And the CURES is especially important, cause we're dealing with substance abuse and controlled substances that are over-prescribed. And I think everything we need to do as soon possible, make sure that those patients don't get medications that shouldn't get there. That's the concern I have, so I mean, my message is, get is done as soon as possible because patient's lives are at risk.
1669	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	XRlbggrWMkA	519	530	And I just wanna know, as we move forward with iPoker, as far as the question of suitability, even just the Gaming Commission or the state being able to handle that.
1670	Hadley	David	40	Jfvd2Tinaec	950	972	For each of the members of this committee, the cap that the local school districts would be required to be spent down to is less than one third of just the deferrals. That the state, that payments that the state did not make to those school districts in the last recession, so these are reserves that are critically needed to manage the volatility of our state revenue stream.
1671	Garcia	Eduardo	38	B_DlPPzaBGc	1015	1032	This bill is asking that those two cities be included, the sponsor of the bill is Coachella Valley  Mountains Conservancy, and it has support from the two cities, the City of India and the City of Coachella. I respectfully ask for your aye vote. Here to open any questions.
1672	Allen	Benjamin	70	_4l4q_6Hap0	924	936	This is all about making sure that people who are eligible to drive are given their driver's eligibility and then held accountable for mistakes made on the road, points on their record, whatever else.
1673	Olsen	Kristin	15	G4RiUnTMom4	80	97	The Local Control Funding Formula, and the Local Control and Accountability Plan, are innovative policies that give local school districts and county offices of education the ability to allocate education dollars based on the unique needs of their communities while keeping districts accountable to parents.
1674	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	HgBIr1hupMw	532	559	Well, let me suggest to you that if we start at the earliest possible age and we know through brain mapping that the most critical period in a child's development is from 0-2 or 0-3, if we can capture these young... our youngest minds at the earliest possible age so that they have a quality opportunity for early education and that's starting at the, you know... Some would argue within the womb.
1675	Weber	Shirley	44	9oY9RNUdfPk	422	437	But that took a number of years. A number of years of support, of working part time at the University, getting our assistance in the ways that we do with child care, those kinds of things. And it truly made a difference. So here we have a story of a woman, when she looks at the 24 months, realizes, oh my god.
1676	Huff	Bob	105	3F-MRhTliC4	743	756	ACR 17 celebrates women in the STEM fields and highlights an exciting area of endless opportunity. While women make up nearly one half of the working population, they only represent 26% of the STEM work force.
1677	Leno	Mark	60	bv9YSPFbNEk	820	854	It also adopts placeholder trailer bill language streamlining the expansion of the restoration of competency programs, and then lastly augments the governor's restoration of competency requests for 10.3 million by 6.1 million for a total of 16.4 million and that last 6.1 million comes from the savings of the rejection that Senator Hancock committee had made for the 105 IST beds.
1678	Weber	Shirley	44	9oY9RNUdfPk	385	405	Which is to really stabilize themselves, and get the education, and do some things, and get some support going for themselves so they would not be in need of assistance before. A young woman who works in my office in San Diego was a CalWORKS person at one point. And when I mentioned to her about the 24 months, she was stunned because she was a young woman,
1679	Wieckowski	Bob	55	QmHhObaXRjg	819	841	water districts that don't have the authority that this legislation will correct that. And I will remove that, amend the bill to remove that entirely, because it doesn't recognize the implicit authority that they have. It's an important bill. It's urgently needed to address the drought administration.
1680	Irwin	Jacqui	16	Y0xkoNoudD0	97	111	Lord we ask for your blessings on this body and on our honored guests. We thank you for bringing us together today as we celebrate so many remarkable women who are leaders in their communities across California
1681	Fuller	Jean	49	A1UTGLmNv2E	1562	1588	Great. Wait just a minute and I'll get it quiet for you. Please stand by for just a moment.  Okay, members, if you will return to your desks, except for those who would like to stay together at the very back of the chambers. Thank you. Senator Morrell has the floor. Please proceed.
1682	Hernandez	Ed	103	2V6gzfYtqAs	599	625	I'd like to make a couple of comments. First of all, assemblymember, I appreciate your passion for consumer rights and privacy. I don't disagree that everything's in the web. I mean, everything from, I mean, Google has more information than anybody would ever want to know. But what I'd like to bring it back to is what is the purpose of this testing?
1683	Allen	Benjamin	70	IQPza6hTge0	688	707	And Senator, I welcome-- I think both of us welcome a conversation with you about additional flexibility. We share the same concerns and, you know, I'm a former-- I'm an educator myself and we want to figure out a way to make sure this works for all of our families. Thank you.
1684	Hertzberg	Robert	99	iJc5cTYtc4Q	980	1008	The discussion, yeah, you know this started in 1935 and then it was a for sure property tax. But if you look at that history of the Legislature, you always have, when you've got a big problem, someone tries to find a revenue stream. Sales tax has always been a general fund source of money. But because the price of gas was going up from years ago, then Assembly Member Dutra introduces and passes Prop 42 that says sales tax on gasoline has to go for transportation.
1685	Nazarian	Adrin	36	WcsBFY-gdrQ	2103	2122	Thank you, and my comments were gonna be very similar. Even though I humored all of you a moment ago by asking if that was the end of the opposition, because the first time around when we had the hearing, we didn't even have a single supportive representative of any of the cities.
1686	Cannella	Anthony	61	IQPza6hTge0	1044	1060	SB 131 seeks to address the shortage of physicians in the Central Valley by appropriating $1.8 million for the San Joaquin Valley prime program. There are currently 27 students enrolled in the SJV prime program. This bill will allow them to enroll up 48 students.
1687	Leno	Mark	60	tqB--Js_f48	1045	1054	Alright, so we do have a motion for the Senate, and just to point out, this creates a new fund. The only difference between the houses was the budget bill language.
1688	Gray	Adam	27	FVQ4YG_BqFE	2207	2220	Okay, that bill is out. Members, I think that concludes our business. We will thank you Mr. Levine for bringing a tie to committee today and we will leave the roll open for five minutes for add-ons.
1689	Bonta	Rob	85	6ril8VUEbBs	1494	1507	Thank you. Additional witnesses in opposition? Seeing none, any questions or comments from committee members? We have a motion, we have a second. Senator Liu, would you like to close?
1690	Pavley	Fran	104	Ab32yuFXwvM	658	685	The uncodified section of the resources budget trailer bill from that same year, that was Senate Bill 855, required annual reporting on UIC actions for five years. The first report was filed the last four years, none. Despite the promise of last, just a month or two ago when you had the hearing not only from Director Nechodom, but also Secretary Laird, that that report would be submitted.
1691	Allen	Benjamin	70	9GlTqPUGK00	727	746	And thus could not issue permits and lift the moratorium that we've had in place since 2009. So, what this bill does is empowers the state Water Resources Control Board to use its regulatory power under the Federal Clean Water Act to address the water quality issues associated with section dredge mining.
1692	Mitchell	Holly	64	MTWW-DN4Tdo	7	23	I'll open by inviting my two colleagues on the dais to provide some opening remarks for this, our final subcommittee hearing for this budget cycle. And we'll start with our most freshman member, Senator Monning, how about that?  Senator Stone.
1693	Chiu	David	7	86lIew9ia6A	1072	1091	At that point it's very difficult for a community-based organization to chase them down to get that documentation. And what we have heard is that similar programs that have used this kind of reimbursement model has often meant that organizations have not received significant funding for work that they did.
1694	Mullin	Kevin	31	JQ5xKCGxzzk	518	546	Good morning, Mr. Chair. Good morning, members. Presenting ACR 67 which simply states for the record that the California state legislature in its entirety formally renounces and opposes a proposed ballot initiative which would urge harm to be inflicted on individuals based solely on their inherent, unchangeable characteristics as human beings.
1695	Mitchell	Holly	64	ho-PTBXT9zU	501	516	We talked about some of these very issues and just to say that not only that jointhearing but there are a number of pieces of legislation going through the process, one of which I'm carrying to continue to look at making sure that it's not just a matter of prescribing drugs.
1696	Hancock	Loni	98	fMvnlUAhyII	518	534	We probably won't be there for quite a few years. What I liked about what we have here, is that it does set of baseline of information that we can all agree on and then we fill in the gaps.
1697	Mullin	Kevin	31	PZ5qNcZ4hzo	1179	1193	Thank you Mr. Chair and members. With the rising health care costs and increasing medical eligible population across the state, there's a need to strengthen the capacity of our current health care system to address the health needs of our most vulnerable populations at lower costs.
1698	Lara	Ricardo	107	66IpAVpTbHU	351	366	Oh, I will spend it. But, I just want to be the one to spend it. Sorry it's great to be back in such an esteemed body and, I just wanted to share with you some thoughts about Adam Day.
1699	Cannella	Anthony	61	8UaA3ArF3qo	1049	1059	I was also concerned with the Stockton healthcare facility. Lots of money, its having some problems but we talked through some of those issues about what you're doing to get those facilities up and running.
1700	Chiu	David	7	dlfa8gG_RCg	2151	2163	So, we're listening to your answers to the questions that were proposed. It doesn't seem as if we really do have a handle on seismic safety for our state hospital structure. We have some anecdotal information, but we really don't know what the picture.
1701	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	YGvsvPIzjxQ	1215	1241	I'd like to also announce that AB 597 by Senator Huff is on consent. That's AB 597 by Senator Huff. We will now move to SB 334, it's file item number two. Oh, I'm sorry, we're gonna move to SB 172 by Senator Liu.
1702	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	0JpwnSkUZnE	2232	2252	And so we're gonna have to figure that out. Not only for ourselves, but for other businesses to teach them how to bring those individuals back into society. And I personally wanna thank you the California Legislative Black Caucus. Dr. Weber and I thank you, thank everyone for coming out.
1703	Perea	Henry	33	cflx69hA7mw	563	576	It is estimated the city loan would be repaid 28 years sooner, and taxing entities would receive an additional 5.2 million in property tax revenues to fund their services. We respectfully ask for your aye vote.
1704	Hancock	Loni	98	iboRZTtohWo	43	70	I think Senator Beall raised some very important issues about performance and how we negotiate with health plans and other things, so thank you very much for the presentation today, and we will move on 'cuz we have a few vote-only items before us. Presentations or just vote?
1705	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	hnhklV-igrA	823	835	And agencies that there is damage associated with these greater than the public health, then certainly, I'm sure we'll hear about that and I suspect, we'll hear about that from those of you here today.
1706	Lara	Ricardo	107	kyRwF6Xn7UY	772	785	Next item is AB 617. groundwater, do pass as the amended author to delete the ability to use consistent data. We will substitute the role of AB 361, that bill is approved in unanimous vote of 7 to 0.
1707	Lara	Ricardo	107	kyRwF6Xn7UY	721	735	Moving on to a Assemblymember Obernolte, AB 271, Child care Electronic Records, do pass to the Senate Floor. We will substitute the roll of AB 361, that bill is approved on a unanimous vote of 7 to 0.
1708	Lara	Ricardo	107	kjbtobUTSlE	700	712	Senator Stone, I'm sorry to do this, members it's really getting a little noisy if you can please lower your voices or please return to the rear of the chamber. Senator Stone, please continue.
1709	Mendoza	Tony	52	P7DWk5t_5hU	242	252	And not that we don't have a loud voice, it's just that the makeup of the actual MTA might not be equitable, where it's West Side versus the East Side, we don't have that equitable balance, we're outnumbered.
1710	Thurmond	Tony	4	AHTUrQ6AUYA	1603	1618	With staff we have cultural competency and who have the training and the ability to serve those young people. And for the little bit that we are proposing to do, there are so many more who need the support and this is a great start. I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
1711	Gallagher	James	108	goLRzsDXvfE	32	52	Legislative intent of bill and not show how you're going to pay for it. Because we all know we have tough budgetary decisions that we have to make every year and this bill says nothing about how we're going to pay for it. We need to have a conversation about this, but we need to talk about how we can actually get there. And we have great programs that are already out there. To this day, we have federal programs and Head Start.
1712	Nazarian	Adrin	36	WYVxOJwtXj8	1640	1657	Very briefly, AB 1191 clarifies that the interest generated on a Quimby fee is part of the Quimby fee itself and may be used for park development as specified by the state Quimby Act. With me, is Hilda Sylvia Solis Shaw, representing the city of Los Angeles.
1713	Nielsen	Jim	68	UMWTnjseXyo	1730	1744	This isn't exactly what I would term a minority, but is there anywhere there's a special recognition of the medal hon, of honor winners. There's a lot of them. I've read the book about the medal of honor winners and we have many in California. I've known some.
1714	Nielsen	Jim	68	bnZY7D5DzoY	99	115	The code authorized the commission to define these boundaries in areas where bobcat trapping would be banned. Quote, "using readily identifiable features "such as highways or other major roads."
1715	Hill	Jerry	66	yhT6yC928zE	988	996	Did you say that the, and I just wanna be clear, I thought I heard it and may not have, that the Auditor had kind of a preliminary amendment?
1716	Holden	Chris	78	4HBwd3okHJI	1299	1323	compliance standard would not increase litigation or stunt job growth. With 81 franchisors, including leading brands such as Dairy Queen, and Buffalo Wild Wings, Minnesota is a prime example of a strong franchise growth in a state with strong franchisee protections. Rhode Island is another example. It is the home of Dunkin Donuts.
1717	Leno	Mark	60	g8NOiBUQX74	35	67	So, the bill SB 124 deals with the subject of solitary confinement for those under the age of eighteen. And, I will make the case of, that we as a legislature have really failed, not only our youth, who are in our custody, but also the institutions that manage them while they are in custody, because we haven't even defined in statute what solitary confinement is.
1718	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	6y6CtxPlgMo	1644	1659	Good morning Madame Chair and senators. This bill is simple. Cheerleaders are athletes and cheerleading should be recognized as an official sport in California. Since competition cheer is considered an activity in school, it doesn't fall under any of our state's agencies or jurisdictions.
1719	Bonilla	Susan	3	KvteTWNshTw	1244	1267	Well, thank you so much. And, I think that's a great suggestion, and any other suggestions you'd have we'd be very happy to also consider. I think that what I've Learned, and this is really an educational process of the voter. Is that voters do assume that their mail is coming directly from the warring candidates however many there are.
1720	De Leon	Kevin	102	A5ksLI96f9Q	1434	1453	Thank you very much Madam Leyva. Why don't we go to those who are in support of Mr. Banks. Those who are in support of Mr. Banks please come up to the microphone. Those who are in support of Mr. Banks. Welcome.
1721	McGuire	Mike	93	e-eay8FdlZA	339	352	And again, I'm not trying to single you out right, so just trying to be able to get that information. So where other states are looking at is were there delays or interruptions in psychosocial services, do we track that?
1722	Nguyen	Janet	65	9eA3HqZp1ws	1336	1347	Because that's when they get to collective their $1 bill, $2 bill, brand new dollar bills, and that's when we start banking what we can have for the full year for us children. And so it's actually very exciting.
1723	Hernandez	Ed	103	qzvpjn8Cr2Y	339	355	This is a small part of the solution along with pharmacists, along with how we're gonna increase rates, how we're gonna build more medical. This is just part of the overall conversation, and and to Kristy's comments. Is there going to be an influx?
1724	Bigelow	Frank	91	koHjdiMmBME	168	185	You know, under Senate Bill 1319 and Senate Assembly Bill 1739, both of those picked up the clean up language that he was referring to, and we appreciated that. And so that's how we're trying to get here, is to continue to solve the problems that have been created.
1725	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	mgO95LX_sqE	1024	1044	We know that climate change is probably the foremost challenge of our time. We all know that California's become a leader in mitigating the effects of climate change by developing a strong program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But there is much work that needs to be done at the state, regional, and
1726	Gomez	Jimmy	80	JgpqDSrKaXw	1037	1060	AB 940, Ridley Thomas, clinical laboratory personnel do pass. A roll call. AB 1018, Cooper, Medi-Cal Cal mental health services for students. Two passes amended to strike the bills content instead require DHCS and CDE to convene stakeholder to ensure the state is maximizing federal funding for mental health services provided to students. A roll call.
1727	Gatto	Mike	46	kAZMIWno7zI	472	482	And of course anybody on the panel, this can be a bill that you have.  You can talk about when the bills you have or perhaps a bill you'd like this committee tackle or just go over some of the jurisdiction.
1728	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	IO307YMxf6Q	1313	1328	This is evidence right here that they are, and they're all little and wonderful, andI have to tip my hat to you. I can't imagine doing all that. I stopped at one because I figured I just couldn't do all that.
1729	Mitchell	Holly	64	Lmzm4UU691s	469	489	We've had any number of opportunities to reach out to ask for help and when Constituents reach out to us around a housing crisis. By the time you call your state Senator, your back's against the wall. You have tried everything You can do on your own, so by the time they get to my staff in the district office, you know, they're frantic and so I want to thank you.
1730	Hernandez	Ed	103	LYOrqHadQ70	244	264	And, now, I'd have a much different mindset if the increase or there was a decrease in total vaccinations in the state. But I wanna make it very clear that I still believe in the science and I still believe in vaccinations. But, with the way this current bill is formed, I'm not prepared to vote for it right now.
1731	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	Hi5Vq6PdNIY	411	422	Thank you and, you just another question. In the past seven years UC has relied, it's my understanding is some data that I was given, UC has relied more and more on non tenure tracked professors.
1732	Block	Marty	59	6Q6Wi0P8Q78	333	344	Let me suggest if Senator Allen wants the name of the contractor.  If the Chancellor's office has no legal reason to not make that information available to Senator Allan, it should be made available.
1733	Nielsen	Jim	68	vuTgADMvFlA	630	642	Well, thank you for your sensitivity and that is a very critical point. I would just observe at this point to the members of the committee, what an enormous burden we face.
1734	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	JX3K3k4qzkE	1154	1171	So that if we're concerned about safety, consumer protection, market viability, deployment or expansion and continued adoption of alternative fuels in particular, that there are reasonable regulatory standards and consumer protections toward that.
1735	Lara	Ricardo	107	7VfcnWx6nzU	1534	1542	Members, let's give our youth the opportunity to succeed, to become responsible, law-abiding citizens. It is in the best interest for all to give our youth a second chance.
1736	Allen	Benjamin	70	6q5JSfST1YQ	798	814	It requires CalTrans to report to the CTC in which routes and segments of the highway system are the best candidates for future relinquishment. And finally, it restricts the CTC from relinquishing any portion of the state highway system until Caltrans has entered into an agreement with the recipient
1737	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	hYh0N-NJMx0	1166	1176	That actually I think you're speaking as much to that and there's the state reserves but there's also what capacity do you expect to have on the front line?
1738	Mendoza	Tony	52	QlhPNwq6ivY	2	13	Thank you again. I appreciate the would you put into this. The information that you produced I think it's very clear, it's very direct, and I appreciate your willingness to keep your doors open and your phone lines clear.
1739	Nguyen	Janet	65	o6dY6yB1_H8	2430	2444	And so I want to make sure that all of the partners, especially in Orange County where I represent mostly and where these children actually lives is there's coordination. And as we move forward, you know, there's more discussion.
1740	Irwin	Jacqui	16	IEHFBfAx3rE	685	698	Given the growth in the department's role in the number of programs it supports, the rapid growth of the homes system, and the questions on various issues outlined above, the addition of an Inspector General position is warranted.
1741	Gaines	Ted	24	IKESHE_NOXc	583	632	So a high school graduate is 55% more likely to enroll in college, 81% more likely to participate regularly in sports and extra-curricular activity, more than twice as likely to hold a leadership position in a club or sports team, 78% more likely to volunteer in the community. And, the value mentoring is clear not only in the statistics, but, in those standing behind me. And, they're representing an organization called Shoulder-to-Shoulder. This is a youth development initiative designed for at risk boys to help them live a life free of drugs, alcohol, and violence that could lead to limiting their future opportunities.
1742	Lara	Ricardo	107	XCFU_0j8dAo	1754	1769	So, not to quote my former colleague, Diane Harkey, but, you know, to those communities we say we have SB 535. We have other programs in place to help mitigate, and of course, which I support.
1743	De Leon	Kevin	102	8as6rPb5Xb0	994	1016	35%, 35% of the students in the Cal State system are taking enough units on a semester basis to graduate on time, graduating on time is four years. Now, that being said, unlike the UC system, we completely understand that the Cal State University System has a different type of student. It's not better, it's not worse, it's a different type of student.
1744	Brown	Cheryl	13	wyPJESdYFaE	1830	1850	That's wonderful. Thank you. I want to introduce one of the Chairs, Co-Chairs of this hearing Senator Michael McGuire. Thank you do you have something that you would like to say before we call up the last panel?
1745	Quirk	Bill	23	NwesQVgY4qI	1598	1619	Very good. So this has an aye recommendation, and I support the arguments that we've heard in support. I will just add that making the grand jury testimony public as happened in the case of Ferguson has happened in Staten Island in no way satisfied us.
1746	Monning	Bill	25	H9-I5joylQw	189	209	48% of foster youth are given antidepressants that have an FDA black box label warning for use by children. We, the state of California, assume the role of the parent for foster youth. It's the job of the Legislature to address this problem for a voice that doesn't often get heard.
1747	De Leon	Kevin	102	Q1vYBQdDLNc	1212	1239	Thank you, Mr. President. Colleagues, we're flying the flag of Canada this morning in honor of our very distinguished guests, our visitors at the back of the chamber. It is with great pleasure that I introduce the honorable Cassie Doyle, the counsel general of Canada in San Francisco, as well as the honorable James Villeneuve, general counsel of Canada in Los Angeles.
1748	Stone	Jeff	26	7ULUe19PTjQ	1580	1595	And what I don't want to do is condemn them to their ultimate demise without the possibility of having something that may be in the works, that may be beneficial to them, that may cause side effects. But what are their alternatives? There aren't.
1749	Gallagher	James	108	bzJzCS8XdVc	1796	1818	And you made my point for me because under the legal program that is established law, we already are providing that opportunity for people to serve, and I think they should. But your resolution is asking for a program that has not been ruled constitutional, that is not the law of the land, and that I would argue is an usurpation of our legislative authority.
1750	Alejo	Luis	9	nhiEIYehp1Y	425	443	that has become a priority for the Latino, Black, and EPI caucuses also jointly authored by Republican Katcho Achadjian. Here with me today is Cecily Myart-Cruz, Asami Saito and Margarita Berta-Avila to discuss the value I think studies from a student and educator perspective.
1751	Roth	Richard	106	osLFdvvw3yM	39	50	So if I could ask those who are in attendance who will speak to those issues to come forward, and while we do, I would ask to establish a quorum.
1752	Thurmond	Tony	4	merVIEmEWtA	1773	1780	And that's not directed at anybody here, but I want to know what else is out there. How do we get the money in the hands of the folks who need it?
1753	Stone	Jeff	26	XCFU_0j8dAo	896	921	Thank you Senator, and I certainly appreciate all the comments. And, I think this project is very unique, in that, certainly the public can get involved in an EIR to figure out how we're going to, well actually you don't have to go through CEQA to bring a restoration project to fruition.
1754	Chavez	Rocky	83	aa6v0aO1V2M	28	45	Systemically, if we're going to be improving the performance of our schools, then is there anticipated that in be a reduction in funding in down years from now, since we're getting better.
1755	Mitchell	Holly	64	mvgLH-ItAXY	1449	1488	The cuts we made we're now experiencing the fall-out. I appreciate your time, your partnership over the past year in my efforts to reach out just to get some relief and provide some relief to my constituents, and the ways in which we've been able to do that. I provided you with three-and-a-half pages of questions and comments from my district office staff. All of us, our district offices are on the front line of receiving calls from our constituents, who are looking for relief and direction in some assistance. I appreciate you taking them.
1756	Frazier	Jim	114	z7GYIGDOm-s	1065	1086	a course on the management and supervision of the real estate license activity. By permitting salespersons to elect to take a course on how to be supervised. This bill makes an important change to real estate laws by providing guidance to brokers on how to properly manage real estate offices, salespersons, and brokers associates,
1757	Cooley	Ken	45	6rjOa1qOGPA	822	839	I have Mike Penrose, Sacramento County Department of Transportation here to speak in support as well as Mr. Matt Carpenter from SACOG, who can speak to the adoption of this blueprint process. The bill reads a little bit like a metes and bounds description of property because within the alignment of the road,
1758	Liu	Carol	63	HU5u3bnal2k	1073	1084	Thank you very much. I appreciate the comments made by my colleagues and I just, we all know how important it is for the well-being of our society to improve the
1759	Medina	Jose	81	xxo2ATBDxJE	199	228	Data shows that nearly 50 percent of students borrowing private loans are leaving federal loan monies on the table. Although there is a small cost to the state, AB 721 is an important bill that provides students with the necessary information to make informed decisions about college attendance costs and student lending options. For these reasons, I respectfully ask for your aye vote. Thank you so much.
1760	Bonta	Rob	85	r81aKKdk2dA	1508	1517	We're going to move to the consent calendar. We can entertain a motion. We have a motion and a second on the consent calendar. Madame Secretary, please call the roll.
1761	Weber	Shirley	44	_YWoRdtfoP8	997	1008	And all those things that we do are really targeted towards getting us to the point where we can have some sense of assurance that there's a quality performance, a quality outcome for our kids.
1762	Wood	Jim	72	2gM15KHmKpo	697	715	Well, first of all, we, as I stated I thought fairly clearly, that we are moving away from the $50 tax per plant. We're working closely with the BOE. I spoke with the chairman of the BOE last week who offered whatever resources I need to be able to move forward on this, I met with two of the other members as well.
1763	Lara	Ricardo	107	8ZmrJUXXU4k	114	136	SB 376 simply requires that the businesses providing subcontracted services for work that is already being performed by university employees, tell UC that the wages and benefits they provide their employees do not undercut the wages and benefits that UC pays its own employees for doing the same job, members. That's for doing the exact same job.
1764	Liu	Carol	63	HU5u3bnal2k	1084	1108	working conditions of our students, the success of our students and in part how important it is to make sure that our teachers and administrator are part of this team to help all of us move forward. So you have my commitment that we're going to do the best we can to make sure that our kids get it right. So I appreciate your support today.
1765	Wagner	Donald	88	SHuB-iUXJvo	598	616	Yeah. I wasn't gonna get involved but I've heard something I just have to push back on. I almost always agree with my colleague Mr. Gallagher, and I think he's right on this one as well. I can't tell you how many times because I think it happens every time I try a case.
1766	Wolk	Lois	94	tz0avG0I2sM	723	748	Thank you for that. All right. We're going to deal with high-speed rail separately. So, let's bring up the- and categories. The transportation and sustainable communities, the secretary of transportation, come on down. The Strategic Growth Counsel and ARB, Mr. Corey, you can stay there.
1767	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	17weTAXeEGA	862	889	The goal of ensuring the future global competitiveness of the US cannot be met without the full participation of our nation's young men of color. Establishing a permanent government entity that is tasked with finding, and most importantly, implementing solutions to address this crisis can further work to improve the outcome for some of the most vulnerable citizens.
1768	Monning	Bill	25	w14C8IiFUpY	775	795	Thank you. I guess related to that and maybe for follow up; I don't know it would be your finger tips, but as a function of the need section eight subsidies, and more importantly section eight available housing, how does that availability correlate to need?
1769	Lopez	Patty	89	MTB7_Zz3pKU	28	62	Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chair and Members. AB 233 is trying to set the safety net for working families, poor families eligible for care. Especially the AB 233 will provide a piece of mind to eligible working families and their child care. Funded for the 12 months, supported parental choice of families to programs that best meet any working needs, would aid families and achieve self sufficience.
1770	Galgiani	Cathleen	95	99NWh04_JOI	2163	2179	And if the whole system were turned on its head right now, to try to just conform to something that you would have a lot of businesses having to stop business right now and access would be an issue. And I think that that's an important argument that she mentioned.
1771	Lara	Ricardo	107	qbKF38sndDw	1409	1427	Moving on to Senator Gray. Beginning with AB 1142, surface mining. Do pass as amended per author, to add reporting requirements, modified reviews of reclamation plan, financial approvals and amend to make contingent upon passage of SB 209. Secretary, please call the roll.
1772	Pan	Richard	96	VyoFcVtTJtQ	130	141	But instead of saying high school rodeo, and I realize you're making some other things in statute, because this isn't really about what, you know, what is the goal of curriculum, it's part of the curriculum, right?
1773	De Leon	Kevin	102	FmUMuqWK62w	1167	1186	The news coverage government helped facilitate the conversation between policy-makers and constituents. In that regard, Rick's work greatly enriched a City of Los Angeles to the great benefit of its people. I understand that our good friend, the former speaker Herb Weston now council President of the Los Angeles City Council, is going to name LA city hall's media room after Rick.
1774	Irwin	Jacqui	16	tae4cv2hHsk	1019	1035	There is no doubt that cyber attacks are on the rise, and California state government is a priority target, because of our size and the value of our networks and data. The state bears a responsibility in defending the information it collects, and the critical networks that Californians rely on for services.
1775	Roth	Richard	106	jWp79DKV-DI	781	796	Thank you Mr. Chair. Yeah, I'm sort of a proponent of performance metrics, and I see Orange County has some. How do you keep your statistics? Is this a locally generated process? Or is this something that is mandated or suggested by the Judicial Council?
1776	Ting	Philip	30	mKpc_b2HFII	1165	1181	I know that at times we are the first to do things and we do things that people sort of scratch their head at. And only to find later that we were right all along. So, I hope that we can continue to be part of the dialogue and discussion.
1777	Huff	Bob	105	tX-iRiZ5OnY	785	806	Well, absent a focus study that would demonstrate what the reduction would be, you're not going to be able to demonstrate it. But just as Senator Bates talked about at OCTA and as I talked about previously through the Alameda Corridor-East project, we did demonstrate a reduction in pollution which includes greenhouse gases by keeping mobility flowing.
1778	Stone	Jeff	26	V0u3hJx63PI	344	355	And so, I don't know where we go with this. But, I would like to just throw out there for consideration to whatever agency would be responsible for negating the requirement for ATAR.
1779	Wolk	Lois	94	cZhQQbz4zns	1529	1544	And these are old, outdated commands that do not meet today's standards or really operational for any police agency. We understand the sensitivity. We understand from the LA roads perspective the discussion in the MVA, so we know it's a sensitive topic.
1780	Huff	Bob	105	tX-iRiZ5OnY	806	835	We have hundreds of thousands of vehicles plying our roads every day, and when we can speed them along better, they're more efficient. Now if they were all electric vehicles it would be moot. They're not. We have 6% of our fleet or whatever it is that's electric, it may be lower than that. But we are still a fossil fuel-based economy, and when we can expedite that and lower the emissions, then we're going to have reductions that should qualify for the very criteria that you say.
1781	Nielsen	Jim	68	tqB--Js_f48	1652	1676	And some of the things that are being done with the intent of enhancing the voter turnout are greatly exacerbating the opportunities for voter fraud, even in terms of registration. So I'm very concerned about the mandate issues, just to walk away from.
1782	Roth	Richard	106	fNOTPzEYh_E	409	453	I'm a little concerned about the absence of detail. I mean, I'm not much of an investor and I look at my investment portfolio, particularly over the last couple of weeks, and it's not been pretty. And I'm concerned about our obligation as a Legislature to make sure that our California State University system is funded appropriately and that the facilities are maintained. I'm concerned that in the event of a significant loss in this, what will be ultimately a $1 billion investment portfolio that would interfere, impede CSUs ability to maintain facilities, capital projects and the like.
1783	Chiu	David	7	etnGLuiVGv4	1	18	Colleagues again we're back in session, we have a number of items to take up. We're going to motions and resolutions We'd like to recognize the majority leader, Mr Holden. Mr. Holden.
1784	Dababneh	Matthew	50	1fxZCVj9XoA	764	776	According to California law, if a prosecutor can show that a defendant's money consists of ill-gotten gains delivered from specific criminal activity, then the money is subject to forfeiture.
1785	Holden	Chris	78	CHPaC99Z-AQ	1184	1194	And so we hope that this would be at least a first step in terms of making an increase that would be viewed as stronger than what it was previously.
1786	Rodriguez	Freddie	69	VkWyifymNDY	846	866	For EMS response, minutes count. Any delays in receiving medical care adversely affects medical outcomes. It is a sad commentary on our ability to summon emergency aid when a business model such as Uber is able to corporate mapping technology more effectively than the 911 system has been able to do.
1787	Garcia	Eduardo	38	Y_NLzMPyU6M	536	555	So as much as we well, and, I know for speaking for myself support the bill, I'd like for us to put some attention on the matter of the actual infrastructure needed to be able to put the alerts out at some point and I know this is not this bill, but I just wanted to call attention to that problem that we have in certain parts of California.
1788	McCarty	Kevin	22	4grozHybHJ4	847	860	Okay, so with that, we will now start from questions from committee members. I'll have a few, but I'll defer to it to members of the committee. Let's start with Mr. Ting.
1789	Morrell	Mike	51	rn8iMdWxrk0	155	173	Even a landlord who owns an apartment building with 20 units or a hundred units and perhaps he's out-of-state, he rents to somebody and they're busted for drugs. Properties like that have actually been seized from totally innocent neutral third-parties.
1790	Gomez	Jimmy	80	22lWaj2Ih1o	701	714	Thank you so much, yea, threw me off, the people up and testify in support of the bill. Please have your witnesses present one minute a piece or less would be greatly appreciated.
1791	Hernandez	Ed	103	m25jL11Z0rE	1355	1368	It plays a critical role in screening, but more in particular, in picking up deficiencies in vision, but  it does miss quite a few conditions of the eye, and it does predominantly check for distance.
1792	Lara	Ricardo	107	jsGbKJLFERc	828	849	And that has impacted, obviously, not only their income, but the production of reduced crops. That means less work for some of our most vulnerable workers that are often in need of funding for housing and some. And so I think, it's critical that we support our workers.
1793	Ting	Philip	30	lri5mYqnVgw	102	117	Thank you chair Maienschein, it's an honor to hold a joint hearing today with our local government committee. And as chair of rev and tax, this is obviously a very important issue, not only in my city of San Francisco, but really throughout our entire state.
1794	Campos	Nora	76	iDZCoA28Gzg	792	817	Physician Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment or POST, is a standard form for physician orders that clearly state what level of medical intervention patients want towards the end of their life. It helps patients talk with their healthcare team and loved ones about their end of the life choices.
1795	Mendoza	Tony	52	0XEmXVzSg6Q	1662	1688	This resolution acknowledges this important historical event and recognize the contribution of Pakistan-Americans throughout our state and our country. Pakistan-Americans are an integral part of California culture and society. In California, Pakistan-Americans have made great contributions in the field of finance, technology, law, medicine, education, sports media, the arts, the military, government, and many more.
1796	Cannella	Anthony	61	2aI5J_1P430	628	646	I think this would have been a great tool, but as it was, we got a one page document at the end of session that really kind of mucked up everything that we were doing quite frankly. So, I hope now that we've got the administration's proposal. I hope everyone's open to a to changes and I look forward to that bi-partisan approach.
1797	Berryhill	Tom	54	0yf1SfBcDOs	2323	2348	And when you talk about going maybe over to the Bay Area or something like that, that might make some sense but to complete this thing where people are actually going to use it, you're talking hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars, and is that well invested money? We can argue that one way or another. But I don't think it's unreasonable to bring this back to the voters.
1798	Mayes	Chad	79	xnlrOV-AGaQ	166	194	Knowing that I've been here in this capacity as an assemblymember for seven months I've been having lots of conversations about the Salton Sea, people had asked me what's your plan? And I've restrained myself to give my plan because the last thing that needs to happen is another elected official Gets elected and then, all of the sudden, I want my plan to be in place.
1799	Pavley	Fran	104	CoCqxpnnd8w	1092	1117	Okay. If this bill gets amended I'd love to be a co-author, just so you know we're working on an wildlife corridor and overpass over the 10 lane 101 freeway in the Santa Monica Mountains for many of the reasons one of your witnesses stated not only because of the biodiversity and genetic makeup animals on both sides of the freeways. But also protection of motorists.
1800	Gipson	Mike	28	xQtK7XDQgbs	46	77	Thank you very much for your testimonies. We ask that you would remain at the table. If you can just move over. We're gonna have Nathan Brostrom, from UC, the chief financial officer to provide his testimony and presentation. Thank you very much for joining us and if you could just please state your name.
1801	Pan	Richard	96	OOj1xAhpXgw	1255	1278	These incidences at school and college campuses accounted for some of the highest casualty counts in the nation. College and university police officers are also responsible for investigating sexual assaults against students, which is a burgeoning problem given the availability of alcohol, pernicious presence of controlled substances used to facilitate sexual assault, and a new-found absence of parental supervision.
1802	Dababneh	Matthew	50	ROiUoxqGjEc	1054	1069	Among the requirements for pre-qualification is a commitment both the contract and subcontract levels to utilize a highly skilled and trained work force for our apprenticeable occupants. This is critical to assure that schools are built to the highest quality standards.
1803	Monning	Bill	25	4INVuEQu1gA	1068	1087	The loan would become a lien on the property and allow homeowners to pay for the costs in installments in the form of debt service payments, collected through the existing property tax collection mechanisms. The lien would run with the land, staying with the property upon sale, thereby increasing property value.
1804	Roth	Richard	106	Ty0_iZ3tnjo	295	328	In response I personally marked up the bill, did a mark up of the bill proposing some amendments back to the committee. And those included requiring the CASp to submit the inspection report to the business within 30 days, eliminating the 15 day opportunity to correct signage issues. Re-emphasizing that the retention of the CASp by the business and the CASp inspection must pre-date the claim or demand an order for the business to secure any opportunity to correct.
1805	Nazarian	Adrin	36	bgIZ8epTm-I	1490	1516	What AB24 does do, however, is set three minimum safety standards when transporting people that do not go beyond what is in current practice for transportation companies in this state. Just want to make sure. Gonna repeat that last part, because it's very important.
1806	Pan	Richard	96	AGRN7-GFw2A	1428	1454	All right, it's gonna have minor offset costs to provide for the option for safety monitor operator to complete the ABC Elite program. And we work with ABC to ensure that the Essentially these costs will be offset by fine revenues, and likely covered by the fees provided by the private training providers. I respectfully ask for an aye vote. And I have witness to answer any questions.
1807	Beall	Jim	92	cvDmVx__4xs	549	568	 We can have a hearing and discuss it and make them explain, make them actually explain their process if we needed to do that in terms of a hearing on the rate setting for this. So I believe Senator Berryhill's bill is correct and would move the bill.
1808	Hernandez	Roger	37	Kc7udwSIfNk	1185	1208	Thank you madame President and members. This vehicle is intended to establish funding sources to provide additional access to services for state's MediCal and developmental program. I ask that we not concur in Assembly amendments in order for this bill to be moved to conference Committee, along with the Assembly commanding measure AB second extraordinary session, AB 1. I ask for a no vote.
1809	Grove	Shannon	77	A6ledtIW6-Y	1286	1301	I am however very disappointed that we did not address funding for the communities, especially if we're gonna move another 1,100 people, and when I think about the community itself, I don't think they've had a raise in the last decade, and the raise that they did get was taken from them.
1810	Atkins	Toni	110	nhED5L0HREU	67	87	In 2010, the state's unemployment rate was 12.4%. Today it's 7.3%, still too high but a world better. The state recovered all of the jobs lost during the recession, faster than all but five states. In October, California created 41,500 jobs, more than any other state.
1811	Wolk	Lois	94	vOdSCzF5aoo	101	128	I happen to support high quality, low risk securities in my life. And certainly when it comes to the tax payer dollar, or students, or agencies, I happen to support that. I think we've gone awry with risk and risk-taking behavior, and finance at the local government level occasionally. We know about that, and at the state as well.
1812	Stone	Jeff	26	07ilphfHuEw	590	604	So, not only are we keeping employees that we don't need, we're even entertaining giving them raises and it shows the whole the debauchery of the State of California and our budget process and trying to run lean.
1813	Mendoza	Tony	52	ewcXToh_gOY	1310	1322	And I want it to stop here. As Chair, I would like to take the author's amendment, I mean the Chair's amendment to remove the second week of sales to allow us to continue to work on this bill.
1814	Stone	Jeff	26	07ilphfHuEw	578	590	If we don't need those employees, we could save the state $500 million and put it towards the infrastructure needs that we've been struggling and proposing taxes on our on our constituents to pay for.
1815	Garcia	Eduardo	38	u8oZZTgP2Tw	1225	1240	This is a very important bill that puts the California's workforce development programs up to code as it relates to the changes made by the federal government in two thousand fourteen.
1816	McCarty	Kevin	22	LjL6ZVCwjY0	921	954	Sometimes it's better to be lucky than good. In years past we had to make horrific cuts. And the last couple years, we've been able to make some increases. The last two years were modest, this past year was finally a significant increase grant and it hasn't replaced all that was lost. But I still don't get how even during those lean years, when California basically had to cut back on all kinds of programs, including higher ed,
1817	Wilk	Scott	19	dKyb6eNIcTg	1630	1643	I want to see this extended to all projects not just for a select chosen few. CEQA abuse is real and stands in the way of important infrastructure projects, hampers efforts to create more affordable housing,
1818	Allen	Travis	43	AW7ZOJRT_Sc	234	253	Thank you very much Mr. Chairman. I'm here today to present AB 997. So, for the majority plastics cost-effective recycling is difficult if not impossible. The reason is that recycled plastics at the end-user level must be cost-effective relative to new plastics for recycling to be sustainable long-term.
1819	Weber	Shirley	44	PeQL6v-QN50	1868	1880	transition, and that is what this is about so we totally, in the black caucus, support ACR 2, because it really represents our vision of the present and our hope for the future thank you.
1820	Irwin	Jacqui	16	G0q0929_P6I	211	221	This Committee will work to accelerate the steps being taken to protect California from these cyber threats; and start by taking a self-critical look and cleaning up our own house.
1821	Weber	Shirley	44	Jy18DQ2_OCI	1462	1479	We had a chance to think about this as well and realized from our own staffing that this is a much more complicated issue that obviously has not had all the parties weigh in on it. We have not necessarily heard from labor and a number of other groups concerning this proposal.
1822	Thurmond	Tony	4	vsNWmpwObU4	34	45	Labor and Pharma, and a, and thank you for providing me with what you know I love more than anything from our time together in Sub 1, a four hour committee conversation.
1823	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	rek1UfAle3c	621	636	However, AB 337, the State's expense would be very small, while the support for beginning classroom educators would be substantial. I ask for you to look in, look at this with an open mind and from another perspective.
1824	Rendon	Anthony	120	hrVBNy8V670	141	157	It doesn't need to worry about what's record of decision looks like because it's unlikely that the appellate courts will exercise there discretion to grant the review. The time has come to reverse course, AB 825 is that course reversal on judicial review of PUC actions.
1825	McGuire	Mike	93	qbDN-8u61LI	1131	1149	And what I had said to the Assemblymember is that when we continue these discussions with the assembly and all of the authors, I know Mr. Assemblyman, this is gonna be a point that is gonna be brought up and have robust discussions. So, I give you my word that we're gonna continue that discussion related to Los Angeles County.
1826	Cooley	Ken	45	gmSplS1IxCE	428	448	I want to say that our time in this institution will be greatly enhanced as issue by issue, we learn to roll up our sleeves together to confront the challenges of the state, figure out what makes sense among ourselves as we relate the problem to the understanding of issues we bring from our constituencies, ourindividual background.
1827	Thurmond	Tony	4	Hc7WoMlUJqU	1264	1282	My intent was to ask a clarifying question, because I think I understand what the vice chair was asking but if he feels that he's gotten an answer to his question about being able to lower the salary or not, I don't want to add to it, but if he feels he's got a satisfactory answer, I'll just leave it at that.
1828	Quirk	Bill	23	UdyJhNk-vh8	531	541	that's been in the bill all along. Again, I just have to take a look and of course I know that you will bring the bill back if I do something awful with it so.
1829	Levine	Marc	8	DEi_8R7XWOE	763	773	This this was a bill that had a potential for, for being very challenging. But I think that under your leadership, you did a very good job of addressing many of the issues, and I know that you're committed to continue to address them as we move forward.
1830	Wolk	Lois	94	U5tNwb5MlsY	352	370	I think that we have a real opportunity to hear from folks in agriculture and, I think that something we ought to be staying around for listening to and asking the questions of those testifiers. Mr. Chair.
1831	McCarty	Kevin	22	tEVG8ziCjnU	887	904	But I guess the question is: if we are going to specifically say in California under LCFF, we  want to make a special emphasis and focusing on these kids and we all know the outcomes of these kids aren't very good, then why wouldn't we have a policy that deals with all of them as opposed to just a third of them?
1832	Williams	Das	12	R2W5ElFvow0	1880	1909	Motion by Stone. Second by Rendon. I do wanna ask the Senators or the environment attorney from Santa Barbara, to respond to the question of the leverage that this law would create or not create, the claim by the representative from WISPO was that would just take the state out of the equation and the Feds could still approve the lease. Could you speak to that?
1833	Wieckowski	Bob	55	GcYm7_0fTAo	1061	1073	And the financing, when we've identified $715 million, is that net? Or is that, cuz my recollection when I served as a redevelopment person said that we bonded for a billion dollars, but we actually only spend less than that because we had to pay that debt servicing.
1834	Leno	Mark	60	U5tNwb5MlsY	370	391	Thank you Senator Wolk. Despite Mark Twain's admonition that in the west, "whiskey is for drinking and water is for fighting," this will be a civil discourse. And just to remind everyone that Senator Wolk will  be Chairing a budget Sub 2 hearing on the subject of water on March 19th, and that will be first of many.
1835	Stone	Jeff	26	Xps8YHyq2fA	866	889	And one of the things that was very apparent during our committee, especially with my good friend Senator McGuire who's from this area, and from the families of residents that have been there for really decades, is making sure that we have an appropriate place for some of the most severely disabled people to be able to be accommodated to in the community.
1836	Beall	Jim	92	1-lHMg2FsZ4	1358	1372	Let's come together and address that issue now instead of letting the problem grow and expecting someone else to resolve the issue later. Respectfully ask for aye vote, and I have witnesses Mr. Chairman, thank you.
1837	Levine	Marc	8	h0wii6afZCs	2520	2537	Thank you very much Ms. Grant and, before you leave, we can be sure to exchange some information particularly with Ms Leahy so we can follow-up with some of the points that you made. I'd like to do that. Thank you. Sir you are up.
1838	Hueso	Ben	48	-bJq_JGSuxY	2189	2202	Okay, great. Just want to make that clear. Do you want to close? Maybe in your close, if you can respond to some of the concerns. Did we have anything from the Committee? Okay, before we go to you on that.
1839	Leno	Mark	60	vpNS8YXwTNY	1878	1916	Well as I just mentioned in response to the Chair's question, we, as a legislature, have already authorized the Air Resources Board with the authority to reduce pollution from cars and fuels and vehicle miles travelled. We are always in the position to give further direction to reduce authority, extend authority. It is always within our purview. So I don't really understand that criticism at all.
1840	Beall	Jim	92	1JV-wI6cFUY	2105	2122	Thank you, Senator. So, Members, we're... The Senator's asking that she not take a vote today, and we'll agendize it at a future meeting with discussion in between. Okay, thank you. Thank you, Senator.
1841	Williams	Das	12	n5MXFS_19l0	80	108	Members, I began this while I was Chair of higher education. We asked institutions for information and I still probably only have information for five of the institutions of the hundred, nearly 130 institutions in the state. This data will be essential to identifying trends in order to determine were to allocate resources and addressing the problem of campus sexual assault.
1842	Allen	Travis	43	8bOmzPkZfE0	2054	2068	For that simple reason I would say we should include the parents. I do very much appreciate Assemblywoman Weber, your comments, Assembly member Thurmond, your comments about charter schools being public schools. Absolutely charter schools are public schools.
1843	Beall	Jim	92	rSN8XCdpbf8	257	273	Yes. This would allow multi-year funding. It's an enabling bill, so it doesn't really change the cost of anything. It allows multi-year funding. I'd like to point out that multi-year funding is used in many projects across the country to fund larger projects.
1844	Thurmond	Tony	4	vsNWmpwObU4	151	162	I, I, I am sensitive to the industry's concerns here and I think that's very, very important. I think we should put a spotlight on the cost and to do so in a way that protects proprietary concerns.
1845	Glazer	Steve	10481	4lx0MqjDD6Q	1459	1494	That's a good question and certainly share your philosophical views about local control. And I guess I would say this, we've given them, what, 50, 60, 70 years to work on that and yet, we still see these examples in our state. So I think we've given them that opportunity to do the right thing locally. And I do support that as a fundamental goal. But in this case it hasn't happened. So I think that a little nudge from us is probably what's necessary to deal with the remainders of these examples, these poor examples that we do see in our state.
1846	Pan	Richard	96	YFmVbaB_4iY	539	550	She asks, why is my child's school made unsafe because of a decision of another parent? What about my child's right to an education? And what of this mother's need to make a living to support her child and family?
1847	Chiu	David	7	tr961U921gU	1658	1670	High-level question for you, I know it's probably a litle more complicated than my question but, what level of resources do you think we need to be investing as a state to start to reverse the affordable housing crisis?
1848	Leno	Mark	60	Ir2eiizDgdE	1378	1392	Close your shops and bring your customers or get ready to close down. I don't think it does our conversation any good when such misinformation is put out there. Let's have an honest conversation.
1849	Weber	Shirley	44	myyM8i0TuNI	909	931	And it's been a very effective tool to use. Every now and then I get a notice that my schools have had a lockdown. And so when you think about the potential that's there, I hope as a state we come to recognize the danger that could happen or the tragedies that could happen from something like this that looks like it would be expensive to put in all our schools.
1850	Williams	Das	12	1l8Sm-QNSvU	61	80	Specifically, AB 514 bases the fine on the severity of the threat to public safety and health, and will increase the maximum fine for first violation to no more than three times the permit fee with a cap of $5,000 whichever is less. I think there's been a misconception that it would be for $5,000.
1851	Harper	Matthew	14	Jfvd2Tinaec	265	284	Studying the impact of unifying California school districts, would allow us to know for sure if school unification is beneficial for those local areas. This study would be used as a tool for Californians across the state are determining whether or not to unify their local school districts. I'd respectfully like to request an aye vote.
1852	Atkins	Toni	110	CY8dWb1-gXw	2079	2101	I feel passionate about this. If we need, in some way, to do a better job, that's our job to do. It's our job to fix, to review, to respond to counties and to cities, and say your program is too cumbersome. You're making it too hard for us to access this. But we have to balance those things with oversight and review. And I think this is a good start.
1853	Perea	Henry	33	kmplgTQ8GXM	477	485	AB 904 will help get the new and used clean vehicles into the hands of the middle class and the working poor. Respectfully I ask for your aye vote.
1854	Mullin	Kevin	31	X5ZwfIJ2xIA	157	181	Members, a quorum is present. We ask our guests and visitors in the rear of the chamber and in the gallery to please stand for the prayer. Today's prayer will be offered by Assembly Member Shirley Weber. Doctor Weber?
1855	De Leon	Kevin	102	eKT-QISxTY4	36	48	Okay. We've established a quorum. Let's go to bill referrals. Let's go to a file item number one. I think we've reviewed it already. Do we have a motion? Motion made by Vice Chair, Ms. Fuller. Madame Secretary, please call the role.
1856	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	VyoFcVtTJtQ	1972	1985	Well, I appreciate that, Senator. I'd just like to remind you that there are different levels of proof that are required given different types of proceedings. This is not a criminal proceeding, this does not preclude there being a criminal proceeding.
1857	Mitchell	Holly	64	EkjCB3EukYI	1468	1493	Ayes 25, noes 13. The measure passes. Colleagues, we will return to the order of third reading. Where we left off prior to the break. We will start with file item 116, yes 114. Senate Bill 736, Mr. Secretary please read.
1858	Weber	Shirley	44	1dDkNt95rgU	1612	1621	Campuses will be required to hold a student election on the implementation or appeal of any current or opposed to student success fee with the majority of the student body voting affirmatively.
1859	Bloom	Richard	2	2IKoCnJyE-g	953	974	Liquid sugar is a particular problem because of how it is metabolized by the body. And so I'm here to present AB 1357, a bill designed to create a fund and a funding source that will provide a significant source of revenue to educate and provide better nutritional outcomes for young people.
1860	Hernandez	Ed	103	lVI-Q1bHrK4	0	10	Thank you. Let's go to move to item number one. Is there a motion? So move by Senator Wolk, item number one, AB 50, do pass to appropriations. Call the members, please.
1861	Bates	Pat	58	D-fVk6CkUDE	1252	1261	I think it's 2025 or 2030, it goes out there quite a bit, but those will be shared for maintenance of the road in general. So, I'm going to remain opposed.
1862	Wieckowski	Bob	55	A2CxN21_Gyw	1977	1999	as I feel comfortable with, but I realize that it may be helpful. I think we have to do, all of us, need to do more work in this arena because my understanding is, when the judge accepts me as the executor, that's an order of the course. I'm recognizing you, and I'm empowering with you everything that's on the probate code.
1863	Weber	Shirley	44	rKOC2CSv6h0	105	125	Followed by an opportunity for public comment in support or opposition and members' questions. And I propose that we vote after the presentation so that we can, when possible, substitute the roll to make the hearing as short as possible. We will do this in file order, beginning with SB 101. I'm not sure if the Vice Chair has any comments concerning the process.
1864	Leyva	Connie	62	BDjsPtF4Upk	1565	1578	One of our biggest issues was negotiating benefits and whether or not they were in-network or out-of-network. We were forced to negotiate like that because they were very, there weren't enough dollars to go around.
1865	Leyva	Connie	62	BDjsPtF4Upk	1578	1596	And one of our biggest challenges was encouraging our members, the hardworking folks at Albertson's, Ralph's, and Vonn's, CVS and RiteAid, everyday workers, to make sure they used in-network hospitals so that they wouldn't get a huge bill.
1866	Anderson	Joel	57	BvEiMZK1K8A	2338	2348	I hope that some day that I will have been married for 59 years to my wife and feel that same deep love. Again, our sympathies go to your family and certainly you're in our prayers.
1867	Allen	Benjamin	70	xZgWg023k_I	1215	1238	And then as a piece of housekeeping, I know the Senate has a floor session at 4 p.m. I think, the plan for now is for us do as much as we can up to then briefly adjourn and then reconvene after the floor session. But we can discuss that further as we like. OK. It should be a quick floor session. It's just is the passage of these drought measures. All right.
1868	Leyva	Connie	62	BDjsPtF4Upk	1614	1636	I sat on the appeals Committee of this trust fund, and every year we saw hundreds of cases of members who have done the right thing but then had been hit with this huge bill. I think that this is an issue that is a long over due for us to resolve. It's something that we can do to help the hardworking Californians in this state. I urge an aye vote.
1869	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	37JGlYuk31E	429	441	Like I said I come from a highly immigrant community. People from East Africa, and the Philippines and Mexico. People who've seen the devastation of some very real diseases in their own homes.
1870	Hertzberg	Robert	99	A2CxN21_Gyw	1414	1431	the death records so that these companies can otherwise be informed. Otherwise, the massive amounts of material just keeps growing and growing and growing. Or there's a lot of stuff that may not be relevant to anything that no one else ever wants. So all I would suggest is that, just like what we're seeing now in market conditions,
1871	Baker	Catharine	74	AAng3WP84Ks	1215	1251	If you've ever heard of the Simpson tie and if you have anything to do with construction, you know about it. The Simpson tie makes our building safer for earthquakes, for high winds, and for water events. So Bark and Sharon became very successful through the family business and did not become passive people in their communities. They were very active philanthropists in our area of Contra Costa county.
1872	Olsen	Kristin	15	dpByeg5zAi8	468	480	In fact, prior to serving in the state legislature, I was an administrator in the Cal State system in the CSU system and I was required, on an annual basis to provide an evaluation to all of the employees in my department.
1873	Beall	Jim	92	qmwCF9xPDEw	852	870	The committee analysis raises some constitutionality kind of questions with the funding the legislature approved in AB 8, and until it's overturned in court, we're pretty confident that this funding will keep its integrity.
1874	McCarty	Kevin	22	ZXZJp00flVo	1930	1965	Okay, last but certainly not least is our package on early education and child development. This is certainly something that the assembly subcommittee put plenty of thought into and certainly pleased to present a comprehensive package projected to peg out a little north of $600 million to help restore funding for this really important program to help our young kids get ready for kindergarten and succeed In life, and certainly, the agenda outlines it.
1875	Block	Marty	59	YKXU5BUfkbE	1182	1196	Yeah, just briefly, the subcommittee really appreciates the changes in the May revision. The Governor was responsive to many of the concerns that came up during the subcommittee meetings. We're still concerned about two issues that will be addressed, we hope, as this moves down the process. Those are.
1876	Mitchell	Holly	64	9eBx3f-E0dc	152	172	I look forward to continuing those global and granular discussions this year through the select committee, lifting women and their families out of poverty and eradicating racial discrimination are the best ways to help marginalized children realize their full potential and to help our society make opportunity real.
1877	Gallagher	James	108	95pquWUVfBw	286	306	So I think using that as a basis for this legislation I would need something a whole a lot more objective and third-party that's not vested in this ideological fight in order for me to make that as the basis for legislation.
1878	Leno	Mark	60	ZHlQISHQoPg	194	213	So you can spin numbers any way you want. This is a reasonable proposal, and again, what's some of the opposition, unfortunately, didn't make mention, and especially, I'm sensitive to the smaller business owners, and I am a small business owner, I've been one for the past 36 years,
1879	Pan	Richard	96	DJsU22tiuNg	1082	1110	And then they're going to impose that rate on the other physicians who haven't agreed to that and it's the average. So there's going to be half of the people who actually got contracted rates higher. I think that gets to be a bit problematic. There's a reason why you didn't take that contract, okay, for a variety of different things, so I'm not sure that is really reflective of a fair charge.
1880	Nielsen	Jim	68	DKVG7yVdxSc	926	948	Let me acknowledge here at this point though, Republicans have offered many ideas. We may yet offer ideas understanding that this is dynamic. I'm not sure if we will offer floor amendments to this bill, but if we do, I would like them to be considered constructive and friendly amendments and not hostile.
1881	Hancock	Loni	98	PR6Aqie0NK4	1379	1394	And it was like people who had never before thought about it could do it. Also, in the system is that you can only give a $5 contribution once, so you can't say, "Well, there are eight candidates running. I'll give everybody a $5---."
1882	Hall	Isadore	1	Gcdptg51L2I	311	332	Today, the California State Senate will send its own message. We are not tolerating the bigotry, the hatred, and the racism that has been spewed in the State of California against our immigrants who have lived here and who have worked here and provided for our country.
1883	Burke	Autumn	6	a4X1msw4NL8	1983	1995	in the Senate removed the rate floor requirement for managed care plans and make technical changes to more closely align the bill with the existing waiver. The bill has broad bipartisan support and I respectfully request your aye vote.
1884	Nielsen	Jim	68	TPx_LL6qRDw	142	175	Let me give you all a hand. Let me assert one other thing too. I spoke of some of the responsibilities and opportunities folks like the members of this Committee have to serve you, but we have another role too and all of the people that work on your behalf in the districts that we represent. A good part of the time that we spend and our staff spend is indeed helping veterans ourselves, as legislators with the agencies of state and federal government, so we have our own role.
1885	Mitchell	Holly	64	k4GcCA0Jbo4	1504	1518	SB 443 is a multi-pronged approach to a problem facing many California communities, requiring that in most cases a defendant be convicted of an underlying crime before their cash or property can be permanently seized.
1886	Hueso	Ben	48	90yWX-I7oeQ	843	859	In fact California is leading the nation in job growth currently and it's mostly because of our clean energy policies. California is the location of over forty thousand businesses serving and our advanced energy markets.
1887	Monning	Bill	25	Ln1AhL9Lp3Y	1399	1417	And engage the entire community, in exploring, how do we transition to a new mascot that captures present day sentiment about respect and honoring all cultures in our communities?
1888	Gatto	Mike	46	PZ5qNcZ4hzo	483	497	Right now if you kill somebody in California with a gun or a knife there's about a sixty something percent chance that you'll be caught and brought to justice. And If you kill someone with a vehicle, there is 80% chance that you will not be brought to address this, just 20% of those who kill someone with a hit and run are brought to justice.
1889	Chiu	David	7	Vrc3ih-DRQU	122	133	The clerk will open the roll. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote.  The clerk will close the roll and tally the votes. Ayes 51, noes 4. The measure passes.
1890	Block	Marty	59	75GgF4MuVHk	1912	1934	While they don't do a hospital residency, because they don't practice in hospitals, they are required to do 1200 hours of clinical experience. They're supervised by a board here in California that includes two MDs, one a Harvard trained MD. There was a committee that met, looking at the Affordable Care Act coming in.
1891	Stone	Jeff	26	w3XqiN30Dys	13	44	Twenty-seven oil platforms that are decades old reaching the end of their productive life, not one operator has applied for a permit under the California Marine Resources Act with these financial incentives that require 2503, AB2503 requires the owner or operator of an oil structure upon a receipt or condition approval for partial removal to transmit a portion of the total savings 55% by January, 2017, 65% between 17 and January, 2023.
1892	De Leon	Kevin	102	aItBzVMycEU	1480	1510	But on the issue of carb from the good Senator from Orange County, just a couple things that I just wanted to explain perhaps it would add a little clarification. The 50% reduction of petroleum use that appears on page four, line 20. On page four, line 19, it does require that petroleum reduction to be cost-effective and technologically feasible.
1893	Wagner	Donald	88	6e0LFFmZAnE	446	464	So the only issue where you would know would be the language that somebody is speaking, and I was inclined to vote for the bill because I think it does absolutely nothing, and so what's the harm?
1894	Maienschein	Brian	84	HnRJwGFV_5U	1360	1385	We have a motion from Miss Gonzales, second from Mr. Chiu. Any other questions or comments? Seeing none, Mr. Williams, I wanna just briefly recognize you and thank you for your work on this, I, as you and I have discussed several times, I started out being opposed to this because, for the reasons essentially stated by Mr. Wolf, a little bit precedent setting, a little bit procedural issues.
1895	Hertzberg	Robert	99	Wt_ez7F9UlE	733	743	Because when you're doing your peremptory challenge. If someone's engaged in improper challenging the peremptories, the other side, the defense or the prosecution, whatever it is, sees the pattern and will then look to this law and ask the judge to make a ruling. Seems to me, it's kind of almost self-enforcing. You know what I mean? That's how it's going to happen.
1896	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	yXONMtuCfN8	1656	1685	We do not want to take that out because we don't want any language that did not presume last year to cover professional cheerleaders in this way, to find a loophole where they can say, "Well some of the work is not being done, for example, is not being done at the stadium. So it's only the work in the stadium that we have to ensure is covered under 1897 and paid as employees."  So we did add Subsection C. We're happy to take amendments to strengthen that, to ensure that their contractors, that they're liable under the contractors misbehavior.
1897	Chiu	David	7	IoZYTkhJCFY	117	131	And we know that this is potentially locking out tens of thousands of Californians from our Worker's Comp system. AB 438 would provide much needed access to services for all Californians, and with that, I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
1898	Calderon	Ian Charles	115	vPceAWe-pfQ	95	112	Although California's unemployment rate continues to fall, and economic conditions are improving, this is not translating to the long term unemployed here in California. A Princeton study found that only 11% of those unemployed for more than six months will ever regain steady full time work.
1899	Lara	Ricardo	107	ptq5V1Fu0ok	244	256	Before I begin I'd like to make a few announcements about how we will proceed so that members and the public and staff can follow along. We will be moving quickly through the agenda.
1900	Stone	Jeff	26	BDjsPtF4Upk	936	954	It's about two hours from the Coachella Valley, and there's a small hospital in Blythe that often we'll see accidents that happen along the Colorado River and when you have these very dangerous accidents, you want to make sure that if you need a surgeon, you're going to get a surgeon.
1901	Allen	Benjamin	70	zqM_Vy0kspE	27	50	This is Senate Bill 778 which is about setting a single, simple, and I would argue, critical performance standard for automotive motor oil, specifically requiring that all motor oil sold be certified to last for at least 10,000 miles, and we've got a couple of examples of oil currently on the market that is certified in just that way.
1902	Thurmond	Tony	4	gvsFAuMIegs	1912	1923	Understood. We are where we are now though, right? And I hope that we can continue working together through the special session to look at that rate increase and you say you can get us a number that we can review?
1903	Patterson	Jim	119	Ai7oaVN8l2E	1852	1868	I just want to make sure I asked the question. Is it your intention to incorporate any of the suggestions and recommendations and the amendments from the Farm Bureau into this bill?
1904	Pavley	Fran	104	UNL7QUa36z0	63	84	And this has to do with whether there's a safety shut off valve, if you will, on pipelines in the requirement. So, we know this bill isn't completely done, if it passes out of this committee moving forward giving the author about a month to work on it.
1905	Pan	Richard	96	Ea-UVDMoM1k	1245	1267	But the thing is that I don't want to come into special session saying well, the Governor saying, well, only the amount of money you are able to find in additional revenues is going to be available to address the issues that he put into the special session, which is the IHSS, the DD and as well as Medi-Cal payment rates.
1906	Pavley	Fran	104	wPtjftt3FVU	249	265	The purpose of SB4 was simply to provide transparency and accountability in the process. The bill was signed back in September of 2013, to begin the regulation of well stimulation treatments.
1907	Nielsen	Jim	68	9GlTqPUGK00	1059	1078	I would argue that it does not meet the test of needing to be regulated by the Water Board because this mining does not create a waste. In fact, it creates a benefit. If there was some crushing need, some great environmental problem, then come forth and show us.
1908	Baker	Catharine	74	Jh9hVGIBY94	1538	1551	And this is for Mr. Hedges. You mentioned your ride alongs that you do. I applaud you for that. Do you have a sense of how either frequent or prevalent other board members may make that type of participation in the inspection process?
1909	Rendon	Anthony	120	5vsmqLYD62k	20	34	I just want to in terms of a few housekeeping announcements, I want to let Mr Strumwasser and Mr O'Neil who's going to be speaking later, know that I'm gonna run out to present buildings.
1910	Eggman	Susan Talamantes	73	cKW0dtBGGXY	2062	2076	I think, oh, it's gonna keep the fire away. So when you were speaking for a while, you were saying toxic flame retardant, or non toxic. So I don't even know if that would help. Because if we are talking about consumer education, I don't know that the average consumer
1911	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	qjDm_sZ-lfo	1923	1938	And obviously we have an urgency matter, this is happening right now, every day that we're not acting more and more immigrants are paying people for a service that is highly speculative. And so that's what we want to stop and why it's so important to continue to move it along.
1912	Wieckowski	Bob	55	dPeGakg4w7Y	949	962	And secondly, there's no limitation on the length of the bond that you're asking people, and the size of the bond, that's up to the proponents under the expenditure plan.
1913	Mendoza	Tony	52	D_2wduB3Bxk	1320	1333	Hold the roll open for the other members to arrive. Do we have any other bills that we can? Great we're going to open the roll for SB 3, so we can have Senator Jackson on.
1914	Hall	Isadore	1	f0azg54_KEY	1567	1579	So I will just pull the bill back and allow you to continue to work to address some of the concerns that will make the members ready for a vote on the bill.
1915	Weber	Shirley	44	J-efxTqVOiQ	218	235	We're excited about the impact of the rainy day fund, in terms of what it's going to look like, and it's growth in terms of being able to at least provide some buffer in more difficult times and difficult years. So, we look forward to this process, we're excited about the packages we see. We wish we had enough money to fund everything in it.
1916	Cannella	Anthony	61	LVzFkfmZq9U	511	520	Well, Senator Hill, thank you again for bringing this to our attention. I think we had some fun at the end of session last year when we weren't able to address it, but I'm actually supportive of everything in the bill.
1917	Cannella	Anthony	61	smXlkYaEapc	831	848	And I think you've demonstrated that with some of your cities that have had some issues. And you've been, I think, very even handed in dealing with those cities. And I asked you if you've dealt with the ag community the same way, and you mentioned that you did. So my philosophy, as a local official for a long time, and now in the State Senate,
1918	Bonta	Rob	85	JfU4ybXUoBc	2090	2104	I think there's no amendments that are right at this time, but, but going forward we had some thoughts in our, in our policy comments that I think you wanted to work on. Eh, I just wanted to clarify that, that is accurate.
1919	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	2UiNZW2oc6A	53	73	And, again, this is the time set for an informational hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee with the Legislative Women's Caucus on attaining equal opportunity for girls in California secondary schools, and how our schools are complying with Title IX.
1920	McGuire	Mike	93	Laqdju9yTYg	373	391	Do you see that as an eventual move on the department's behalf? My other question is in regards to metal detectors or full-body scanners is there resistance from the department or staff team to be able to move in that direction?
1921	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	jSYoUQmoG0c	1434	1447	Let me at least begin and then I'll have, our sponsors kind of chime in,Let me just begin as a, as someone who is the former Director of Real Estate for the city of Los Angeles.
1922	Leno	Mark	60	pchCRkcA1Ic	1056	1071	You'll hear from the sponsors of this bill that they are still facing rate increases annually of 23 to 28% or more. If the large purchaser market was working well, we would not be here today.
1923	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	dic9GH4s49g	1366	1388	My understanding is that current law... This law, this bill actually may not be needed because current law allows, allows school districts to jump over more experienced teachers and, and or, actually it would, what it would allow them to do is lay off very experienced teachers if they don't have the necessary school skill sets for the school to function. Is that correct?
1924	Hill	Jerry	66	KoF0I8ZWJLM	183	205	In February 2015, Montgomery County Maryland, with over one million residents, approved a ban on waste tires and turf fields, and instead required plant-derived materials for infill in future turf field projects. The opposition will bring their giant stack of studies this morning, showing that waste tires are safe in fields and playgrounds.
1925	Rendon	Anthony	120	843OfhKnV14	1475	1488	of the public records process, some of the public records changes that need to happen as well. I spent a good part of my weekend reading the Stromasa report which came out last week and is consistent with a lot of these recommendations.
1926	Lara	Ricardo	107	ChbIO5XT7O8	814	827	Through last year's budget process, the Legislature appropriated hundreds of millions of cap and dollars to the high-speed rail authority. Those funds were designated for acquisition, construction, planning, and other costs associated with the project.
1927	Campos	Nora	76	QFffajW9pIQ	1103	1127	We wouldn't be bringing this forward if we did not believe there needed to be certain policies and laws put in place so that justice is done for individuals who have earned their wages and have not been able to receive their wages. I'm going to turn over to Mario for the technical.
1928	Hertzberg	Robert	99	5xYY96cBqDg	46	66	No. Work with me. Liking the Committee. One minute left. One minute left. Aye, oh. Is there staff for Senator Eggman, or Assembly Member Eggman or Assembly Member Bonta? Anybody can entertain us for a minute?
1929	Stone	Jeff	26	7ULUe19PTjQ	1611	1624	But these patients are going to lose their lives if we don't have any type of prompt intervention. And I think this is a proper tool to help those afflicted with terminal illness.
1930	Mitchell	Holly	64	LCBofa05MII	2022	2043	To my knowledge, Suge Knight is a rapper; not a peace officer. Suge Knight is the indeed accused killer in this case, and so how the notion of people being concerned about coming forward in that case relates to the scope of this bill. I am certain Madam Chair, I do not know.
1931	Atkins	Toni	110	yGdC7D9fPQ8	1616	1639	And I thought, oh my god, I've through this. What am I thinking? I grew up carrying water from a spring, heating it on a stove to take a bath. So, you know what, we have the ability to make sure, I find it outrageous that we have people in our state that have to live like that in the richest state in the richest country in the world.
1932	Beall	Jim	92	en7JgK3RrhY	1096	1122	The other part is, of course, job access, meaning that. When we have congestion, the expanding transit system is really, at that point, the only way we can expand job access. And in terms of low income communities, part of our goal in the Greenhouse Gas Emission is to target areas of high unemployment.
1933	Thurmond	Tony	4	hecrzVTBfRM	53	71	Having said that like to introduce our first panel. We're glad to have our director again Mr Lightbourne, who is here, and Eileen Carroll, who is also here, from the Department of social services and we'll get a little overview on some of the proposals in th Governor's budget.
1934	Mitchell	Holly	64	owIYV6IXgFg	1045	1061	You feel that your members kind of self police, A, and B, that you determine the ratios of what level of professional, RN, LVN, Certified Nursing Assistant is appropriate based on their.
1935	Dababneh	Matthew	50	gCJqYiGvi7w	410	424	I did, however, make the decision to leave in a deadline for implementation because I do think we need to have a goal set out that says, when this pilot program is successful, we will move in to the phase, we offer this product to our consumers. This is not a matter of if but rather when.
1936	Wood	Jim	72	jDVMk92LYlk	110	129	And that treatment leaves an impact on a person's quality of life. Ironically, my younger patients, who have been educated about the problems related to smokeless tobacco, often insisted on an oral cancer exam. Something we routinely did for all of our patients. Even with their health concerns, the addiction is so strong it's really, really difficult for them to stop.
1937	Kim	Young	82	ZcJSZ4qEe4Y	1332	1351	Just quick comment. You just mentioned that the difference between the previous bond bill that we just voted on, Mr. Holden's bill and yours, and you mentioned the differences. His is smaller, and yours is bigger, but the way I read the bill, there is no dollar amount specified.
1938	Mitchell	Holly	64	HgBIr1hupMw	962	979	You know when you think about early care and education and the subsidized childcare program in California, it's probably, in my opinion, one of the most complex programs that the state is involved in when you consider the role fed, state, local government plays.
1939	Atkins	Toni	110	lKgPPhMwBGU	978	996	So, it is a supply and demand issue and we want to decrease the demand by making it, by following state law that we passed in the seventies, that we thought would take care of the demand issue that caused the problem of poaching which is causing these animals to be killed.
1940	Leno	Mark	60	2X-V6mACHAA	401	416	The higher total costs of repaying the bonds, with interest, will be spread out over many years. This financing structure better protects school and city funding for other vital local needs in the near term. The bill is sponsored by the city of San Francisco.
1941	Nielsen	Jim	68	cZhQQbz4zns	255	293	[ Inaudible Background Comment ] And see that's my point. That we should be, and the Governor commendably in a number of areas, including locally unfunded mandates, has taken some steps to redeem that. And I think it's important for the legislature to keep faith.
1942	Leno	Mark	60	jAn9ObwSR14	637	666	So, some tens of millions of dollars have been assured for purposes of clean up and they will not be liable any longer with the United States Department of Justice. Is that not the case here? They still are liable with regards to concerns you have? If not so, what leverage did you have to get what we have yet to really fully understand you got from them?
1943	Hill	Jerry	66	4Ls4aOm_vdA	759	782	And, so I just wanted to, just to make a suggestion that perhaps we could, any controls that may go, as it goes forward, some controls that could be put in place to monitor the contracts to make sure that they're moving in the right direction, and certainly you, as budget chair of the subcommittee, could make sure that, that that occurs as well. So thank you and I'd be happy to, to move the bill.
1944	Lara	Ricardo	107	PFn_-ARbOZU	118	130	And so, and if you've ever visited one of these clinics, it's again limited-scope care, which ends up costing us a lot more money, when these clinics can no longer care for these people, and end up in the emergency room.
1945	Pan	Richard	96	7vLzhqaEeV8	179	199	And then you're also seeing these swings, and one would say that in most other products if you have multiple competitors and so forth, you negotiate between it and try to bring the price down. Where is the appropriate spot, then?
1946	Hernandez	Ed	103	TF5gOrTe590	2164	2187	We need to look at residency programs and fund residency programs in the areas of greatest need. Yes, we need to increase MediCal reimbursement rates, that's a critical part of it. Yes, but look at this series of bills that I introduced two years ago with the pharmacy bill, which got signed into law. That bill now is becoming a national standard where the pharmacists are playing a more integral part.
1947	Bonilla	Susan	3	b4gDbT98z6E	2366	2380	Right. Let me be clear. And I think what would be a great idea, and an addition would be to proactively communicate with the local elected representatives, and the state representatives from that area.
1948	Bigelow	Frank	91	yGXJHar5FlA	770	808	We have the consent calendar before us today, which is items 734 SB 800, SB 803, SB 148. I'll entertain a motion to. We have a motion by Miss Weber, a second by Mr. Quirk. Is there anyone raising questions about the consent calendar? Seeing no one raise any questions to the consent calendar, that is out on an A roll call. I think the only remaining item is a review on the call, for
1949	Patterson	Jim	119	WPjNTeG9jTo	256	274	Current law allows state agencies to find businesses and individuals up to $1000 for violating regulations even for minor violations that do not harm the environment or threaten public health and safety and are simply a one-time honest mistake.
1950	McCarty	Kevin	22	XZ58s4vcLvc	87	104	And so, we'll be talking about this alarming trend, today as well as, ways how we can make sure we increase funding for the system to serve more students as we look to increase enrollment at all systems of higher education to serve the workforce needs of the, of the 21st century.
1951	Campos	Nora	76	lr5iK8Kvlcs	822	833	The newspapers that you talked about, and I come from the City of San Jose and being able to make sure that not only the big elephant in the room.
1952	Hall	Isadore	1	LLFc5MNdXPw	1481	1494	In the assembly local government committee on Wednesday, SB-39 would grant the city of Los Angeles the ability to renew franchises, permits, and leases in the Port and waterfront communities of San Pedro and Wilmington.
1953	Campos	Nora	76	lr5iK8Kvlcs	835	847	But that the ethnic chambers or the ethnic newspapers have the ability to be able to receive some of those funds so they can reach out to their communities. Whether it's around Covered California or any of those other issues.
1954	Gallagher	James	108	9Kkq97ccCr8	1399	1416	So I'm just making the point that we need to work on both ends of the spectrum here, and I feel like we're really missing it on the top end, that would really help a lot of the people that we're talking about today. So I would just encourage the same people who are talking about this, To advocate on the other end as well.
1955	Bloom	Richard	2	bgIZ8epTm-I	444	456	I have with me today Anthony Harrison and Steve Schuler, both with California Energy Efficiency Industry Counsel, who wish to speak in support and answer any questions that the committee may have.
1956	Gomez	Jimmy	80	_NTagRCFfsc	1545	1564	Thank you, Mr. Chair and members. AB 428 establishes a five-year 30% tax credit for qualified costs for seismic retrofit construction of qualified at risk building. Specifically, this bill caps the total amount of credits to 60 million over five years.
1957	Beall	Jim	92	RToDyZa8pHM	1552	1572	If we're going to have the subjectivity, we must beef up the ethical behavior and not only for the people reviewing the contracts but the people offering the contracts. And there's been some bills before this committee in the past that dealt with that particular issue.
1958	Leno	Mark	60	CW6mZhhMcnU	532	555	I don't know if there's political will to create a new fee. I don't know if there's political will to use the general fund. So it seems that this fund could be appropriate. And by law, as Senator Stone points out since there is no nexus between non-petroleum and petroleum spill other than the common front on our water ways it by law must be paid back. So it will be paid back.
1959	Cooley	Ken	45	WiCoRtyssyw	342	366	So in the recession, in 2014 it did not have a sufficient level in there to maintain the fund which by then the requirement was over $300,000. It was over $300,000 but not over it's required $324,000. This will reinstate it. These programs are extremely important and particularly during a recession actually the level of children child abuse increases as families are under pressure.
1960	Stone	Mark	20	5cExo6Kc7gQ	1	38	Good morning. We will start the assembly judiciary committee for Tuesday, June 30. We will start as a subcommittee, our first author is Senator Monning, item number two, SB253. Yeah, and just for the file item number seven, SB 582, Mr. Hall, and item number six, SB 501, Mr. Wieckowski, have both been pulled from the agenda. Senator.
1961	Gomez	Jimmy	80	rSN8XCdpbf8	1559	1573	Thank you so much. This bill is on suspense and we will take it up in due time. Any other witnesses in support? Individuals from the public in support? Just your name, organization and position, please.
1962	Perea	Henry	33	CoCqxpnnd8w	410	431	There is a great concern that if they decide not to actively participate in GSAs that there could actually be a lot of lawsuits in our valley that could make it even longer for the Central Valley to comply with the groundwater sustainability plans, but we are hopeful that we can work that out over the summer.
1963	Beall	Jim	92	RToDyZa8pHM	1535	1551	I support the bill but I wanted to say this, OK? I think there's a big hole in the work that we do with contractors when it comes to best value. And that's that we need to beef up the ethical behavior element.
1964	Roth	Richard	106	lVI-Q1bHrK4	1028	1053	So certainly in those situations, if not others, I think our California hospitals play a valuable role in helping to identify folks with HIV. Ask them if they will consent to a test, properly identify them and then every one of us is gonna have to work together to figure out how to treat them, get them to a physician, get them to a clinic where they can be treated.
1965	Wieckowski	Bob	55	1-lHMg2FsZ4	237	254	Now they do a light and medium duty, truck, but they manufacture here in California. You've got, Rezvani motors in Santa Ana, they do like a high performance car. You've got Super Performance in Irvine, they manufacture here, they do an electric, high performance car.
1966	Roth	Richard	106	lVI-Q1bHrK4	1008	1028	We certainly know where somebody has a physician and the physician is counseling with the individual, but we know there's a physician shortage, and many of the folks, often economically-challenged individuals, don't have physicians because they can't find them in certain parts of the state.
1967	Stone	Mark	20	WSuppHjpCKY	841	864	And make sure that we're not creating, as was said, a windfall situation, but really, fully setting up a system where people can get a second chance, really have the opportunity to build back, not fall into poverty, not then fall into the need for social services or other services in California, but then really start over.
1968	Gray	Adam	27	oXNKeIzrJ6c	907	937	I believe you have madam chair. Thank you Madam Chair and members. As the Chair just pointed out, you've seen this bill before. Senator Cannella had an identical measure, and it's a bill that I've carried since my election to the Assembly, and continue to fight hard for in the San Joaquin Valley, and more specifically in my district, we face Historic shortfalls, physician access is a huge problem.
1969	Bates	Pat	58	j_gGP70jLkM	777	799	We welcome you and we hope you have very good luck with all the business that you came to do today, thank you. Members. Further privileges of the floor. Are there resolutions or announcements? Seeing none.
1970	Nielsen	Jim	68	hUewX1j74kY	864	919	I'm not asking you other than to highlight it, and I want to do a little bit of inquiry in to it, point being that such revenues that are so uncertain to me ought to be going towards capital projects, you know, that can get completed. And that retirement, that's the best investment of these so-called extra revenues. Another thing that really is important, do we have any ways of quantifying the success of cap and trade? Are these areas that are so-called reaping the benefits are doing that capping and trading, is there anyway we can quantify actually what reductions are incurring pursuant to all of this adventuresome process?
1971	Leno	Mark	60	PdAu9Oh2C5Q	966	975	The reason I ask is that I thought we were about a billion, and they're gonna subtract five hundred. That might leave us with about a half billion in that regular reserve. Again, different from our budgets table.
1972	Hancock	Loni	98	slpYLwAvmtM	279	298	The next item is capital outlay. The governor's budget and the April 1 finance letters request a 100 almost $131 million for immediate and critical needs in the court system.
1973	Gray	Adam	27	QruWeQOWjh0	1266	1281	And, in fact, they've had to pursue basically a public-private partnership idea. That the Chancellor's developing to bring in the monies to build up the campus to service needs right now. And I, I think that's terribly, unfortunate.
1974	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	yhx1NvxzAgA	1003	1024	When we're talking about incidents where a lot of the testimony and the witnesses will be from other places. We have federal laws that also protect in that we have used. To great advantage in dealing with cases where we have people who have been aggrieved and righteously seek their day in court.
1975	Bonta	Rob	85	P6cBeme--dw	1249	1262	And we did hear that bill in special session. We had a robust discussion. We had proponents, opponents, experts on both sides, we heard comments from Committee Members and we had questions asked by Committee Members and answered.
1976	Anderson	Joel	57	j1Gi-ueVYBU	152	166	I have just a couple of follow-up questions for you. So when you fly in somebody's private land to follow that river, do you get permission from the land holder? Because you're flying awfully low.
1977	Bonilla	Susan	3	mCVaWE-xXHw	640	661	And addresses the issues raised in Sunset review, but the Dental Board has been operating with a structural deficit and is projected to face a deficit in the fiscal year 2017-18 or even sooner. Prior to a recent dental fee increase, the board had not raised fees for two decades. That's 20 years. That's a really long time not to raise fees.
1978	Salas	Rudy	34	BQgV9eqQ2Tw	823	842	Thank you, Senator. This does have a do pass recommendation from the chair. I do appreciate that you are trying to fix this little problem, so that people can actually fundraise for the commission. It is a worthy cause, and with that, Madam Secretary, please call the roll.
1979	Hancock	Loni	98	R0Q6fnev0vA	597	651	The motion is do pass as ammended to appropriations. Yeah, I have looked at this bill for a long-time and I am going to supported it today because it does deal with jail balance, not misdemeanor. And it is a loophole in the existing laws since 109 was passed. And, I'm also very cognizant that CDCR is concerned about contraband in prisons and jails. We all are, and we're looking for non-invasive ways of dealing with that issue, in the Budget Subcommittee and other places.
1980	Liu	Carol	63	52URYfZsNNs	1615	1634	PE versus extracurricular activities and school districts according to the Ed Code, and we may disagree with this, do offer the school districts are not an option to account activities toward physical education but you've heard from the folks.
1981	Stone	Jeff	26	rn8iMdWxrk0	22	41	With that said, I stand here today to ask members to join me in supporting SB 433 as written today and with the amendments adopted by the Appropriations Committee. This makes this bill a good bill. It is a fair bill. This bill basically says that the government cannot seize the property of innocent people.
1982	Mitchell	Holly	64	4YUeKJp9AQ0	1239	1257	I think the collectibility of rent doesn't impact the HOA, it impacts the home owner. And so I will restate if that will help you to clarify cause that was not the question or the issue raised by the HOA repeatedly. Is a fiscal impact to them if rent can't be collected.
1983	Hadley	David	40	DaiegGG5yrM	1213	1227	I believe it's a dereliction of duty for the members of the state legislature to hand this degree of authority to CARB. I believe that what we should be doing is we should be doing this in the reverse order.
1984	Mullin	Kevin	31	IpuJ5glgG_U	1055	1068	Thank you Mr Santiago. Seeing no discussion or debate on this item the clerk will open the roll. All members vote that desire to vote, all members vote that desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote.
1985	Gipson	Mike	28	r0_c68VZXFY	279	289	But, his organization stands as a testimony of the community, in terms of how far we've come, but yet, still how far we have to go. So, Mr. Tim Watkins.
1986	Hueso	Ben	48	xrb7OkoktfM	1551	1587	Thank you, Mr. President. As Vice Chair of the California Latino caucus and proud San Diegan, I'm very honored today to be here to ask you to adjourn in memory of former Assemblymember Pete Chacon. He was an educator, an activist, a political trail blazer who passed away in December, December 14th to be exact, at the age of 89. Mr. Chacon served in the Legislature from 1970 until his
1987	Melendez	Melissa	41	1ddkqgmLsnY	175	193	This act would prohibit retaliation against legislative employees who make protected disclosures of ethics violations, it would also establish a procedure for legislative employees to report acts of retaliation and would impose civil and criminal liability on a person who engages in retaliatory acts.
1988	Bigelow	Frank	91	XSL2yLxKUCc	239	258	While this is not the ideal outcome for AB 995, I would like to hold off on a vote today to allow stakeholders, members of this committee, and members of the Assembly Transportation Committee to come together and find a comprehensive solution for California's farmers who transport and harvest to feed the world.
1989	Harper	Matthew	14	Z5dUcZuiBfw	620	644	Although some Californians that participate in WIC and CalFresh are exempt from the paper bag fee, the working poor who do not qualify for either program will be hit the hardest. The paper bag fee will cost Californians approximately $613,000 million dollars a year. This money will go back to the retailer and won't be used to benefit Californians.
1990	Leno	Mark	60	ZnhfCEAKzDU	949	961	And these forms are there to take away an option. So I again appreciate the debate. Strong points made on both sides. But I know where I land and assemblyman I'd be happy to join you as a coauthor when you are amending the bill.
1991	Mathis	Devon	75	wK5CwGDTeOM	568	585	Members, we've talked about the drought, we've talked about how water in California is the number-one issue facing us. This bill helps those people who aren't able to help themselves right now, it gets them water immediately.
1992	Wagner	Donald	88	9mjyTPfbhPw	212	236	who often quotes poets on this floor to us. But I'll give you a snippet of Dylan Thomas, do not go gently into that good night. Rage, rage against the dying of the light. That's compassion fighting for life. Fighting for quality of life. Fighting for medical care to provide the quality of life.
1993	Leno	Mark	60	PyDS77ZdGH4	2	22	Thank you Senator Hancock. Director  Ziegler, I am going to ask, if with your blessing we might skip over to General Manager Grant Davis just because I think there's some synergy to be created with the presentation that Miss Firestone had just given and we'll give you the final word.
1994	Levine	Marc	8	aX3hcacca8I	985	1002	This bill simply reiterates that federal officials, including immigration officials, are not exempt from having to petition the court for access to that information. Currently, some probation departments are automatically providing juvenile information directly to federal immigration officials without obtaining authorization from the juvenile court.
1995	Hancock	Loni	98	a6D1KFF96cc	450	474	To ensure due process an agency filing a petition would obviously be required to alert the the adult and make reasonable efforts to have them attend the hearing. They would also have to have made or be making a referral for conservativeship.
1996	Liu	Carol	63	8TJNuTDd7yI	33	53	This bill is a followup to SB391, which I authored in 2009. And that bill required updates to the California Transportation Plan to address how the state will meet its transportation infrastructure and mobility needs but also achieving greenhouse gas reduction targets.
1997	Gomez	Jimmy	80	wK5CwGDTeOM	847	860	Mr. Speaker and members, I rise in support of AB 954. I want to commend my colleague from Porterville for his advocacy on this bill and as for his idea on this bill.
1998	Thurmond	Tony	4	kIKVbsrTmqg	793	810	And for those reasons I would humbly ask that this committee choose to not direct this to suspense, but to allow the bill to continue to move through the various venues that we still have to have to discuss what is the appropriate amount that the legislature could -- And the state could afford to spend.
1999	De Leon	Kevin	102	Mt9BcU600uM	1492	1545	Now, let it be duly noted as well too. I would add a couple things. One is Ms. Parini, if you could be so kind enough, in reference to Ms. Mitchell's comments in the upcoming confirmation process with the Mr. Santi Rogers, the upcoming director, that that be part of the questionnaire as well as, may I also suggest, between now and I don't know if it'll be on Friday when we actually have the floor confirmation. I apologize, I don't remember the individual who came here last week... Mr. Doyle. Because Ms. Mitchell was unable to be with us last week, perhaps we can set up a meeting upon, obviously, upon agreement of Ms. Mitchell between now and the floor confirmation.
2000	Bonilla	Susan	3	Vrc3ih-DRQU	1692	1712	Yes, I just rise in support of this bill. And, thank you for all the clarifications. I think this is an incredible opportunity. There's a reason that TechNet and Microsoft are supporting this effort and it's because they want to come and partner with our schools around increasing STEM education and also teacher training opportunities in computer science.
2001	Bonilla	Susan	3	54O2UbeLCuE	1438	1454	And my daughter will come home at the end of the day, and I'll say, ask your coach. Ask your BTSA coach what to do with those students that aren't performing and it really is critical to what we're all trying to do, which is have all of our students be successful in the state.
2002	Leno	Mark	60	Q9LdqK3BIlI	1476	1493	I think this is a really great proposal. And to the degree that we get millions of Californians their licenses back and maybe we pick up a few hundred million dollars at the same time, not a bad deal for everyone. Any other comments from the committee? I did want to touch on just one other thing.
2003	Obernolte	Jay	86	GSFM9WIHPWo	1331	1343	Thank you Mr. Chairman. I have a question about the state auditors report that had some critical things to say about your department's flaws in your budget allocation process.
2004	Allen	Benjamin	70	KvteTWNshTw	548	572	I support the 18 font, and I also obviously support this bill. But, the one other thing that I wanted to clarify, this sheet that you gave us, the language is different, the actual wording. This says that this is mailer was not paid for and endorsed by the candidate. And then, my understanding is that your bill asks for the language to say this advertisement was not authorized or paid for by the candidate or Committee controlled by the candidate. Just to confirm, this is the language that will actually appear.
2005	Liu	Carol	63	IQPza6hTge0	30	52	And I want to take a moment to welcome out new Vice Chair, Senator Sharon Runner who is replacing a longtime friend to education, Senator Bob Huff, and Senator Bill Monning who is also joining us on the committee so we have a full compliment of nine members. So, welcome everyone.
2006	Wood	Jim	72	OACKM5KF8Sk	839	856	get the benefit of your cost associated with that. You know, it used to drive my wife absolutely nuts that on a yearly basis, and we track this, they gave away about $20,000 worth a year of care, directly.
2007	Hernandez	Ed	103	qOUtbPV2_wY	332	349	Additionally, the Institute of Medicine recently reported that raising the age to 21 would result in a 12% additional decline of tobacco prevalence and 250,000 fewer premature deaths for those born between 2000 and 2019.
2008	Campos	Nora	76	yAgUQvRrkrQ	1227	1267	He was known for the calmness he brought to a chaotic situation. The bravery he showed Tuesday night and, every night that he put his time in San Jose and when he put is uniform on. For his big heart, Officer Johnson is survived by his wife Nicole, his parents Kathy Decker and Daniel Johnson, and many other loving family members and by the Police Department in the City of San Jose.
2009	Moorlach	John	4657	RToDyZa8pHM	640	657	 I'm just curious after hearing all the arguments. Mr. Church, is there a way that there could be a collaborative effort that you review the work done by the BOE before the filings are approved? Is there a function there that you could establish?
2010	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	YGvsvPIzjxQ	288	314	That not only requires an affirmative consent, but also requires that our colleges and universities take responsibility to make sure that their campuses are free of this kind of assault behavior. It impacts the way young men and young women in particular learn and succeed. We have to do more though and be more preemptive.
2011	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	YGvsvPIzjxQ	272	288	Thank you. If I may just chime in, in support and thanks to my colleague and Senate Leader Kevin De Leon for really taking the lead on this critically important issue last year. As you know we jointly authored SB 967.
2012	Nielsen	Jim	68	SuJy5eE040k	788	800	If you are an inmate parolee who absconds, then that could result, it used to, in a long return to custody. That doesn't happen now, and if you absconded and left the state, that was deemed an escape.
2013	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	A2CxN21_Gyw	400	413	Cuz it is the children who suffer under these circumstances. So, I appreciate and I know there is no perfect answer. I know that there are amendments in the analysis that you are taking as-
2014	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	0HDXR-Yl1D8	911	936	Thank you very much. There's a lot to be done here. I will say that the State Bar has indicated and been, so far, very, very helpful forward thinking in the work that we see ahead of us. And, I look forward to working with them and then, crafting a bill that reflects a lot of the recommendations we'll see at the end of this audit in the next month. And with that I'd ask for your aye vote.
2015	McGuire	Mike	93	6uURceuzWYc	652	676	I think that it we take a look at the roll-out, I know this is an issue that both the Chairwoman and myself are going to be focusing on heavily over the coming months and I know that having many conversations with the director, which I know he's really excited about, here in the months to come.
2016	De Leon	Kevin	102	ZW0bBeI7WzQ	704	721	If we're not on the right pathway, what exit ramps do we have to make the modification necessary? Irrespective of one's political party or ideology, I think we all want the same thing. We want clean air. We want clean water for our current generation and generations to come. But we also want economic sustained growth.
2017	Pan	Richard	96	oc8zggZcgHM	410	420	You mentioned that there's going to be that there is an process and developments a new set of outcomes additional, set of outcomes and metrics that you're bringing people together.
2018	Cooley	Ken	45	KrJyHNx6FKg	198	222	Yes, good afternoon again Chair and members. Here I am presenting AJR 6. This is a measure that is designed to urge the President of the Congress to enact legislation supporting federal guarantees to support the responsible sale of post earthquake bonds. The issue here is, here in California we are an earthquake exposed state.
2019	Leno	Mark	60	k_l5daYZc00	1206	1224	Thank you, Senator Stone. Well articulated. Could I see a show of hands of how many folks are here to speak on this item? Okay. I'm going to ask if you could keep your comments to within a minute and if someone else as your comment already spoken we respect that you not repeat everyone.
2020	Cannella	Anthony	61	eKT-QISxTY4	241	254	My father works for the Board, and he's, has a lot of confidence in Mr. Dresser and in the agency as well, so I can't see why we would not reappoint you. I think that we would go backwards if we didn't do that, so I look forward to supporting you.
2021	Mitchell	Holly	64	8GUUuCOIXCY	307	333	It's okay. And, and recognizing why that's in the State's best interests, it's the students from those communities who will stay here, and buy homes here, and run for for office here, and start small businesses here, and keep California on the trajectory to which we have grown accustomed, as being the innovator in this nation and in the world. It's those students who will continue to be Californians. And that's critical.
2022	McGuire	Mike	93	zEbSrzyLdms	1493	1507	And in this special session, we're supposed to be having that same conversation, but we're not gonna hear the conclusion of the task force until the end of the year, or first thing in 2016, how are we supposed to do our job here?
2023	De Leon	Kevin	102	8GUUuCOIXCY	277	307	And i know those budgetary considerations, given that we ourselves made some really deep cuts, given the economic recession. But, this is the point I just wanna really highlight, because that's why, getting to the weeds, and really understanding the goal, and focus too, has to be to address this large gulf, this chasm that should be of highest priority. And I apologize Ms. Mitchell.
2024	Bonta	Rob	85	L9F9T_3SHNI	362	385	I just want to thank you all for your participation. Thank you for your commitment to collecting and gathering more data that can inform the steps that we take going forward and I just want to thank Deputy Director Miller. I thought that your presentation was particularly compelling in a couple of those slides you just presented such a stark set of data;
2025	Quirk	Bill	23	nJKGlctoBAE	1579	1607	Okay, thank you very much you folks. Thank you very much and I appreciate your very thoroughly answered Senator Leno's earlier question. I'd now like to go on to President Durant and I kept him for last so that he can respond to the various comments that have been brought up here. President Durant.
2026	Hernandez	Ed	103	w8RK3-qsxL8	24	38	If you look at the federal government and what the role is of Congress and the president, whoever that president may be, it's to look at immigration, immigration reform. It's not our responsibility. That's not what we're elected for.
2027	Weber	Shirley	44	ELlYlrBZUfQ	995	1011	And develop a very comprehensive plan to get this done so we're not left with this receiver that we're under basically still looking and saying to us, you're gonna have to do this $1.5 billion repair and that's gonna happen probably sooner than later.
2028	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	RFWwgE7ubok	1315	1349	We do have a role. I will say that working with this Chief Justice has been I think a very hopeful opportunity. She is a very collaborative person. I think we're starting to see that as she has taken over the bar. I have utmost confidence that we will be able to continue that collaboration going forward. And I appreciate assembly members, Chair Stone's efforts on this. And I look forward to continuing to work with him and with all of you to improve the work that's done by the state bar. With that, I would ask for your aye vote.
2029	McGuire	Mike	93	LuelkxPlWfo	63	80	Home sharing helps countless Californians to pay their bills, and stay in their homes in the state that they love. Avoiding foreclosure, spending more time with their families, and pursuing their dreams. And, it gives guests the chance to experience the real California.
2030	Fuller	Jean	49	iE2i4N-8BMc	339	354	eventually we'll all get together at some point to do a vote for you. But at this point it's not because people don't want to be here, it's just the nature of we over schedule sometimes. So, with that, Senator Cannella, would you like to begin?
2031	Irwin	Jacqui	16	v8Lqd5JpuF0	265	276	Thank you Chair Gomez. I'm gonna be waving presentation on AB 449 and AB 255 creates the office of Internal Audits for Veteran Affairs within the California Department of Veteran Affairs.
2032	Leyva	Connie	62	bkbYI6-vC30	902	925	I had a question about an immigration issue that came up recently. One of the departments has been involved in some ICE issues and its been noted on TV. And just wondering how you feel about that if you think that's something the department should get involved with, with federal immigration laws.
2033	Weber	Shirley	44	BMNgYibzIuk	1202	1217	Okay, the primary purpose of this proposal came out of originally a legislative proposal to basically implement what the district once had which was a proficiency in English program, I can't remember the exact name of it, that was relatively successful at the time.
2034	Low	Evan	11	_b18tzFsHIo	1057	1069	And so I hope particularly for the younger generation who've understanding of this in the class room is critical so that we don't forget history. I urge your support for this bill
2035	Mitchell	Holly	64	lanFVKv-H-g	1584	1611	3-0. 5180, Department of Social Services, trailer bill 604, Employment Development Department data sharing. Approval of the place holder trailer bill language. That's 3-0. And, the final, under section B, under Health and Human Services Agency, Office of Systems Integration. Electronic benefit transfer three project transition to the new EBT services.
2036	Kim	Young	82	UrwGLPEFGk4	767	787	I think what I'm interested in is really providing more time for, the rest of our panelists and the speakers that we have invited based on the tone and the stage that you set for us.
2037	Irwin	Jacqui	16	_r5mHjpNKhY	415	424	Since its establishment it has placed more than 4,000 veterans in new careers, over 250 leading businesses in the state are partnered with the program, the success has even led
2038	Hueso	Ben	48	_oTJFwpIX6s	479	516	And participate at many of Mexico's trade negotiations, including the North American Free Trade Agreement Acts. So he's come from Mexico to participate in this hearing. Dr. Noyola, where are you? Come, come forward. Don't be afraid. You can sit. You can sit here in the panel here and. Welcome. Thank you for being here. Thanks for making the long journey.
2039	Weber	Shirley	44	4l8d3tner_c	61	75	To know that they are getting a little bit more then what they've gotten in the past year. We will hold this one open for greater conversation. But clearly, it's a priority of those in the areas of social services with regards to trying to respond to the needs of those in CalWORKs.
2040	Bonilla	Susan	3	D1U0Ojzunqk	1505	1528	And I think there are some more you know, refinement in terms of the steps of how we get to the whole regulation that can, while not trying to micromanage, involve the legislature as well to make sure that all stakeholders from all of our represented areas are part of this.
2041	Anderson	Joel	57	w2OxGtfP7pQ	1664	1676	So that, that's the difficulty I have going through this. I don't want a ripple effect. I'll be supporting the bill today, but if there was some way that we could address that issue, and it may be that we just can't.
2042	Mitchell	Holly	64	7Nve54D7sWM	1642	1667	Do you think that these con, this vendor transition and these processes that we're still trying to figure out to put in place before our contract ends in ten minutes, June 30, 2015. I'm concerned about delays potential licensees would experience with this operational transition.
2043	Weber	Shirley	44	9UYl1IR1e0U	96	113	That if we don't address it appropriately even though it's an administrative issue that ought to be addressed at the local level, to ignore it continues to allow students to suffer occasionally. And like in anything, one child suffering is more than we need to be.
2044	Morrell	Mike	51	bxDlgoZu0KI	1719	1730	This bill simply allows them to seek out the services of licensed midwives if they so choose. I have one witness here from the California Association of Midwives. Who is the a sponsor of the bill, Rosanna Davis. Again, just to remind you this is a due pass recommendation. And if we can stick to the fiscal arguments, we would greatly appreciate it. Go ahead.
2045	Hill	Jerry	66	Oggr1OKYFzQ	128	149	A sheriff or police chief can decide what to purchase, but it's the elected officials that appropriate the money. As many of you know from your own local government experience, that is the check and balance. SB 741 simply preserves this fundamental relationship. The Police Chief's Association argues that this bill will compel police agencies to use less effective technologies.
2046	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	bB6-EJZQbO8	311	329	Thank you, Mr. President and members. It was so wonderful to see our newest colleague Senator Runner here with her family today., It is a reminder that to have a two-parent intact family is something that most aspired to, but we live in a different world today. We live in a world where there are many children who are raised by single parents.
2047	Hernandez	Ed	103	X49dPLJib5g	157	180	So that's, that's been, that's just another frustration as well. So with regard to, the privacy. And I asked the question to Airbnb with regard to the user data, the taxpayer data, etc. And the home business address, the night stays, and the room rates. And, I don't have a problem with that.
2048	Liu	Carol	63	ik8_Xx3XS1w	1533	1554	Yeah, I know. Which is even more restrictive as far as I'm concerned. Other opposition? Seeing none. Questions from members? Seeing none. Senator Vidak moves a bill. Would you like to close?
2049	Burke	Autumn	6	ZmQN_cLb26Y	239	252	The process is complex and usually involves a series of hearings, all with different notice requirements for the parties involved. For decades the system has relied upon first class and certified mail, which parties with a stable mailing address has worked.
2050	Thurmond	Tony	4	P0E4IzhEzAY	431	450	Chairmember Grove. Thank you members for the discussion and to the department for being on record. You know how we do things here, we get on record and we are committed to the safety and the well-being of everyone but especially young people.
2051	Hernandez	Ed	103	X49dPLJib5g	141	157	Gonna be amendments from the realtors, and actually just reading the amendments from the League of cities there's a couple of them here I really like. Ya know? And what I absolutely hate is doing, policy and writing law in committees and you know.
2052	Pan	Richard	96	Wk2WIga5Dho	1016	1026	I know how challenging it's, it is for the child who's in the foster youth system. Where often if they're changing homes, or changing foster parents, keep trying to keep track and have someone be able to case manage.
2053	Gipson	Mike	28	r0_c68VZXFY	706	726	What also transpired out of this civil unrest, or the revolt, was a community, a police commission, a mayor that had sensitivity to the community and so also to the community voices, a council that wasn't diverse, it became diverse in the city of Los Angeles.
2054	Hall	Isadore	1	MvS4M4JYJ2g	1109	1136	Great, thank you, any other witnesses in support? I see none, witnesses in opposition, please come forward. So if we could get a few up here and, all right. Yes, you may begin. You may begin.
2055	Mitchell	Holly	64	2MXVIex_Zeg	363	393	Any of my other colleagues like to make any opening remarks as we begin post-May revise? Sub three hearings? I appreciate that, sir, thank you very much for joining us today. The first part of our agenda will be vote only. We're gonna go ahead and get started with the Office of Systems Integration, the Hearer's adjustment, we're on page four of the agenda.
2056	De Leon	Kevin	102	kH2FXJE6T-g	1133	1151	Thank you very much, Mr. Cannella. Mr. Xavier, you obviously have a very strong woman who's visionary, geographics are working for you, you have a lot of things working on your side today. We will go to our vice chair, Ms. Fuller.
2057	Grove	Shannon	77	G-cKeAHj51U	2133	2147	It says in the resolution that whereas on 2013, the Supreme Court struck down key sections of the Voting Right Act that were designated to prevent discriminatory policies that can disenfranchise as minority voters.
2058	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	Hi5Vq6PdNIY	264	278	If I could label it that way. And I think the way I'd label cost drivers are those expenditures that are exponentially growing beyond well beyond, well beyond the CPI.
2059	Stone	Mark	20	Gnpfbx52n0w	1457	1474	Thank you. We are still missing a few authors. I realized Mr. Ridley Thomas, item 13, AB 1300. And for all members of judiciary who are probably at caucus if you would please come to judiciary so we can finish up the hearing we would all appreciate it.
2060	Monning	Bill	25	gB0SqdP0x6o	1116	1144	And then I would just join in my colleagues framing on the inmates side. The importance of discovery and discipline, ;eading hopefully to sufficient budgets staff in programs. That there is an incentive path to. Take advantage of drug treatment program.
2061	Thurmond	Tony	4	r81aKKdk2dA	767	779	It does seem compelling that the independent medical review would be very important for someone in this situation and just wanted you to have chance to speak to that fact better.
2062	Wood	Jim	72	89bDX7qtwgo	1447	1469	So my question is I don't believe that you really have a handle on the adequacy of the network, and I think the 10% rate cut decimated the network, and you've got a lot of people on the books that quite frankly aren't providing services anymore or may see an occasional patient.
2063	Glazer	Steve	10481	fRdlkKyIGD4	760	770	So that committee will have lost its opportunity as a committee to cast judgement about that 10% with the exception of what we're doing today. And that's my concern about it.
2064	Wolk	Lois	94	_JbASqkciSI	2144	2156	and come to some kind of an agreement, at least within either the senate or the senate and the assembly acting together through the budget process so that we don't cannibalize each other. That's not the intent.
2065	Huff	Bob	105	w3MaeL9rUCE	635	647	I've got a follow-up question with you. You said there's a lot of concern I would expect that out of Shasta county about testing and the whole standards. What was necessary educating the public to alleviate their fears?
2066	Pavley	Fran	104	fZNtPr5bhc4	1158	1173	We all tend to agree that staying away from earthquake faults and sensitive groundwater basins or water supply is important, so thank you for the answer on whether it's a moving target at all.
2067	Leno	Mark	60	J-efxTqVOiQ	1176	1193	So the Mental Health Wellness grants, which would be the source where the $3 million comes from, Senator Steinberg's SB 82. Is the question for us to consider here, whether pure respite complies with SB 82?
2068	McGuire	Mike	93	zEbSrzyLdms	1712	1723	What my understanding, and I do appreciate the budget sub chair, who allowed me to sit in in that meeting is that that original allocation was gonna be spread out throughout the state.
2069	Gomez	Jimmy	80	JgpqDSrKaXw	844	866	Republicans not voting. AB 483, Patterson, initial license fee for the healing arts board, do pass is amended to exempt medical boards. A roll call. AB521, Nazarian, HIV testing in hospital emergency departments, do pass as amended to apply only to admitted patients. B roll call. AB533, Bonta, out-of-network Patient cost sharing do pass.
2070	Leno	Mark	60	tqB--Js_f48	205	231	All right, you've made your case, thank you. We have a motion for the Assembly version. On the Senate side 2-1, and on the Assembly side 2-1. Sticking with the Department of General Services on page 17, we're dealing with surplus property inventory.
2071	Pavley	Fran	104	b4USpkALPiM	53	84	First of all, Mr. Chair, thank you and your staff for your work. I know we have some continued work to do as it moves through appropriations on some of the items that have been brought up in the past bill too, like oversight, legislative oversight, I get that, and relevance to disadvantaged communities and timelines. Those are things that I look forward to continuing to work on with this particular committee.
2072	Wieckowski	Bob	55	XCFU_0j8dAo	1721	1736	So, Bakersfield does get some carbon discount, but let's say I'm Lodi or Stockton. I don't get to compete for these high speed rail funds in this, in it, because that's not, I'm not an impacted community for high speed rail.
2073	Chavez	Rocky	83	J10r6qWX-gc	1303	1326	As long as you know I'm pretty strong on this issue, but just to form the discussion, I think probably best maybe from the Governor's office or maybe from you. Cuz when I read the analysis from one side, some people see this as government taking over families. Government getting involved in the raising of children.
2074	Hill	Jerry	66	-eBMHFfPn-c	1097	1116	Yeah. When you have a, if you use the example of generics, generics have a reduced cost to, for healthcare, when generics are substituted for the original product. In this particular case, when you have a biologic and then you have a similar, bio-similar that's created from that, it will be reduced cost.
2075	Chavez	Rocky	83	J10r6qWX-gc	1326	1376	And that's really the responsibility of the family. Which I agree, I 100% agree with that. There's a role for the families. But the reality is, could you speak to the issue of what is the typical family in California? What's the problem you're trying to solve? And to give you a hint to where I'm going at, right now children in single-parent homes, single-family homes, as I'm getting data from Kids Count, in San Francisco is 28% of the children are in single family homes. However, in Fresno, it's 50% of the homes. So this is a home where a parent is going to work to make money to put food on the table, to put a roof over the house, and where is that child when this parent is gone?
2076	Hill	Jerry	66	90yWX-I7oeQ	23	39	They went very well a couple of Weeks ago and I think we had some good outcomes from that. We don't have a quorum established yet and now we do. Madam Secretary please call role.
2077	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	jSYoUQmoG0c	2297	2318	To ensure that, that we, we can move this forward. Cuz for me, and I think also for the apartment owners, I don't think they just want to, at hand, just, just say no renting to anyone, cuz I think they also feel that, that they need to bring people back into society.
2078	De Leon	Kevin	102	ZW0bBeI7WzQ	608	629	higher education, those who are developmentally disabled. So wildfires, no doubt, has been on my mind also too. With the issue with regards to accountability, transparency, oversight with regards to CARB. Let me reiterate and underscore to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that my door is open,
2079	Wieckowski	Bob	55	v0qT2NVBpr8	1819	1843	I think there was reference made to a bill that I authored that's on the Governor's desk. SB 246, which sets forth in statute the climate adaptation policy to address this transition of information and cooperation with the state, local, and the regional governments.
2080	Block	Marty	59	6Q6Wi0P8Q78	1599	1617	Thank you so much. And just to comment before we go to the next speaker, for all the students who've testified, you guys are all doing such a great job, I, I really appreciate it. Your content is excellent for us to hear, and you're staying within the time limits and everything so thank, thank you so much for that, and we'll move now, no pressure, we'll move now to the next speaker.
2081	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	Y6LWzDb2ask	712	754	Thank you again Mr. Speaker. I rise to acknowledge the life and witness of beloved in historic Californian, Soviet Johnson. Miss Johnson served the people California in public safety and law enforcement for a half century. She was often the first and only woman or African-American to attain numerous positions. As a matter-of-fact Governor Edmund G. Brown Junior in his first term appointed and re-appointed Miss Johnson to lead a state prison in the Inland Empire that did become a symbol of all that was wrong with our criminal justice system at the time and our oversight is the Legislature of it.
2082	Allen	Benjamin	70	0aAX6Cfa2Ek	577	595	We've actually got a list of some really great public comment, some folks are gonna come up and speak on the dais, at the podium up here. OK, alright so I guess we could do three at a time. They can come sit up at the panel, but thank you so much guys, really appreciate it. Very helpful.
2083	Dababneh	Matthew	50	gT2_z9UGrSs	346	364	I would just like to echo your comments. This program simply sets up the framework to allow these schools to have a better opportunity to get finance, you know, lower costs, which means more classrooms built, more teachers hired, more young people educated, and that, I think, is a goal that we should all aspire to. Thank you, and I ask for your aye vote.
2084	Achadjian	K.H. "Katcho"	5	85T-CDj8RB4	61	78	Rather than attacking the petroleum products, it will be better suiting or better music to my ears, so to say. Just an observation. And for that reasons I might not feel all that comfortable to go along with you this time. But I want you to know where I was coming from.
2085	Gaines	Beth	109	mXX7qM53na4	62	93	Thank you, Mr. Chair. I will begin by accepting the recommended technical amendments proposed in the committee analysis. Diabetes has reached epidemic levels in California. As of 2012, about one in seven adult Californians have diabetes, and many more will be diagnosed in the near future. Diabetes costs California over 29 billion a year, and is increasing every year. No one is immune, and it could strike at any time.
2086	Wolk	Lois	94	rqQyOoekxOk	1376	1394	Okay, thank you. Further questions? All right, thank you very much. Appreciate that. All right. We'll move to the last group of departments before we go to the high-speed rail hearing. Natural resources and waste reduction.
2087	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	dAgT763r35w	654	671	And they specifically, during the Reauthorization Act I think of 2012, indicated that below that area, states were going to be able to provide some guidance within that 0 to 400 or 350.
2088	Wood	Jim	72	qzvpjn8Cr2Y	386	412	Yeah my question, I have to think how I want to word this. I heard from the nurse practitioner from the Russian River area that part of the advantage was savings, the ability to provide care would provide savings in keeping people from an emergency room. Appreciate that, and very much appreciate that, but also heard something in there that
2089	Mitchell	Holly	64	cxFa18iFwgA	1078	1097	And, we'll break my own suggestion, Im sorry Senator Stone.  Yeah, I appreciate that you've not heard and don't have a sense of the loss of a federal funds but, clearly there's an impact on consumers.
2090	Thurmond	Tony	4	8w2MCxTnakA	555	565	The way that this works the best is when the school district and the county's behavioral health agency work really well together to leverage existing dollars around mental health.
2091	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	4l5FjBTBUZQ	58	76	gallons of oil spilled. We know that probably about 25,000 or more spilled into the beautiful waters of the Santa Barbara Coast. Now I've heard that my community referred to in less than I think complementary terms here today but I'd like to assume
2092	Weber	Shirley	44	J-efxTqVOiQ	1631	1645	It will put a hold on it, but as Senator said, it's not that it's not a high priority. I've already heard from a lot of the dental providers, Western Dental in particular, that it's not doing any more expansion in areas where we need it, in terms of communities and those kinds of things.
2093	Weber	Shirley	44	_YWoRdtfoP8	842	860	And, you know, it's like telling -- when we went to win conference and someone from trade tech told us that 93% of the students can't pass the proficiency test in trade tech, I explained to them that is not a system at all, when you have a 7% success.
2094	Weber	Shirley	44	HpHzTWJvRTs	1538	1562	Most campuses will generally not ask for a new campus because it competes with their campus for money and resources even if they acknowledge that the campus is needed. We've had conversations even with our president at SDSU, who's not necessarily opposed to a new campus, but not in favor of a new campus, because they're being cut financially.
2095	Leyva	Connie	62	t8820ItkRNY	135	141	I agree, and I do think that many students feel that they don't have what it takes to get to a UC. So, and speaking with all of you I think you're all highly aware of that and I think that you'll work towards that. Mr. Oakley, there is an issue we've talked about a myriad of issues at the UCs today.
2096	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	HayxEPtHuzU	550	570	Whether or not we can then start talking about whether, you know, that fills, if you will, some of the slots that we have in boys sports. Because, today we don't technically call cheerleading a sport than other girls activities have got to be equalized.
2097	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	g595lZYQYE0	747	763	Yet homeowners associations are still forcing their homeowners to maintain grass lawns, and fining them if they are out of HOA compliance, and still penalizing homeowners to replace their lush water intensive lawns with attractive, well designed landscaping centered around artificial grass.
2098	Jones	Brian	42	R3SMzNAvRKs	1350	1363	We're here to have these discussions. Our voters brought us here, elected us here, and are paying us here to do these exact debates and I would encourage the body to make sure that the point of orders are used correctly.
2099	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	HayxEPtHuzU	570	589	If we include cheerleading, and I'm sure they'll be discussion about ,cheerleading can be very acrobatic and, really competitive as compared to some other aspects and I think that might be part of that discussion. If it truly is a competitive activity should we call it a sport for Title IX purposes of equal opportunity?
2100	Wood	Jim	72	fFPxgxAj-oM	1239	1255	I'd appreciate that. At the next meeting we're going to have, we'll be looking at challenges and hopefully opportunities. I'm already beginning to see some of those challenges emerging.
2101	Williams	Das	12	Gf9OHu0urRM	788	808	And we all want our UCs to be funded fairly, especially because we can improve the diversity of our campuses in that way in a system. But the real core issue is what Mr. Samuels said, is are we willing to fund the UC to be able to enroll our students?
2102	Block	Marty	59	EvD39W6YJ0A	683	693	We think that the more experience our faculty at the community colleges have, the better. We think the more continuity students have, the better. The more empowered the part-time faculty have, the better.
2103	Pavley	Fran	104	gGO-NA0OnUA	320	343	however you want to characterize it, but it's not, the public now is getting very, very concerned about not only fracking, but traditional oil drilling as well. I think you have a lot of work ahead of you, but I think your goals are admirable, and I certainly support them and would recommend an "aye" vote.
2104	McCarty	Kevin	22	1ULf869aoVg	1443	1467	Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Again, on behalf of Mr. O'Donnell I'm proud to presents to you AB 158, which names the statutory provisions that implement Prop 98 in the ed-code as the John B. Mockler School Finance Act. As you remember last month, we adjourned Mr. Mockler's memory who died at the age of 73 from pancreatic cancer.
2105	McGuire	Mike	93	EhsW00cBA0A	1566	1581	Thank you through the chair. Thank you so much, Senator. So, one of the reasons why we're not taking a stance on recreational use is that we believe that voters will have an opportunity potentially in 2016 to be able to express their opinion on the issue.
2106	Frazier	Jim	114	x7WOzO1oE0M	1440	1457	And I'll, I'll correct myself, we did a motion by, I think it was Mr. Dodd, it was hours ago it seems like, but we did have two, two motions. Ashazian and Mr. Dodd and then Mr. Ashazian just to clarify. Thank you. Sorry to interrupt.
2107	Cooley	Ken	45	NEf6zh-NPIY	1442	1463	I think it represents, I would say, a positive sort of effort to try to tailor the program to the circumstances of the individuals who've been paying in creating this surplus. So, I think it could be that there's a bunch of employees in a single firm that somehow simultaneous are on this particular problem, but I think that's pretty remote likelihood.
2108	Leno	Mark	60	uk0vIxtVZmg	769	785	'Cause in this situation, excuse me, we are talking about excavating city streets for the infrastructure of the pipelines. So what is the nature of the mitigation, what is the threshold of the mitigation that needs to be done?
2109	Hancock	Loni	98	m65WWf8IMs4	785	810	My reading of the community immunity levels was that we're pretty much there in California, and that one of the reasons we might not be there in some places is because we count a child as un-immunized unless they are fully immunized for everything. Could you clarify that?
2110	Hernandez	Ed	103	8_WRsqziEsc	222	240	All right. So being a managed health care plan within the rural community obviously seemed like it's difficult to get provider networks and you're being capitated then you turn around and pay fee for service, which of the provider groups you have the most difficulty getting? Is it primary care or is it specialty care?
2111	Kim	Young	82	eYTxGLtgMco	276	286	No, I'm going to refer the this I would like to ask the author of the bill, Miss Baker, would you like to respond to that also? And to the response I just heard?
2112	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	SuWeFSpE-9A	403	418	Technology is way ahead of the day to day exigencies and also our day to day priorities and I appreciate the fact that drones have some very exciting possibilities.
2113	Santiago	Miguel	17	eYTxGLtgMco	761	780	And it didn't really give the board an authority to, to have a, to determine it's own budget. And it's at the time that we constituted a a, a, a rule within within our community college district, that funds can only be moved if the board determined they could, they could be moved.
2114	Hueso	Ben	48	hp2WTRF5hkg	1947	1973	Senator Hertzberg, simply, simply while you're present, I'm going to ask for the movement of your next bill, 697, it's a charter party carriers bill, it, that's consent, if we can just ask for a motion on the consent calendar. Members, if we can have a motion on the consent calendar for SB 697. We have a motion by Senator Leyva. Clerk, please call the roll.
2115	Alejo	Luis	9	3I7f3vKVAeA	286	299	And once online, the solar project will generate enough electricity to power 70,000 homes, displace 370 million pounds of coal and will create a thousand direct and indirect jobs in one of the poorest communities in our state.
2116	Fuller	Jean	49	uBO-fu4onZs	1384	1399	Well, I commend you on frequent oversight. I commend you on being so, on the spot, able to articulate in what process you're in. However, the real critical piece that we were worried about last week, is the writing of the contract.
2117	Lara	Ricardo	107	-Ah0Dbgfor4	314	332	Substitute the roll call from SB 454. That was approved in a 5-2 vote, with Republicans voting no. SB249, enhanced driver's license. That is a do pass recommendation. Substitute the role from SB254, that was approved by unanimous vote, 7-0.
2118	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	scqfU4UsUAo	373	388	Thank you. And even though we've got a two-person rule you came from Rhode Island. I need to clarify that the Red Sox are in Boston but Rhode Island has adopted them generally as their team. So I want to be clear on that. So please, thank you go ahead.
2119	Bates	Pat	58	j_gGP70jLkM	799	812	Messages from the Governor will be deemed read, messages from the Assembly will be deemed read, reports of Committee will be deemed read and amendments adopted. Motions, resolutions, and notices.
2120	McCarty	Kevin	22	tae4cv2hHsk	40	56	The United States governments' been doing this for 15 years now. In the 2000 census, individuals could check more than one box with their race or ethnicity. Know that California's a very diverse place. One in six births here in our state are multi-ethnic, multi-racial.
2121	Bates	Pat	58	WQvzzUrj4uM	1453	1469	According to Cal recycle, California exports 20 million tons of recyclables annually and this is worth nearly $8 billion. Instead of exporting these valuable materials, we should invest in the infrastructure of our recycling sector.
2122	Weber	Shirley	44	LMUACiDfsGg	125	150	But one of the issues that has been raised obviously, and we raised this with the chancellor, I mean the President at one point is one of the issues. The grade point average of students who attend the University of California, as well other UC issues and the whole issue of weighted GPA. What would happen if we no longer require, had a weighted GPA, but simply had a GPA?
2123	Hancock	Loni	98	Htnfsa9QnRM	2099	2129	And most districts wouldn't charge anything for certain minor administrative expenses like this. I would think that while we're posting everything else that is required, with the school report cards, having the date of the last inspection and the address of where to get the report would be totally minor. So I would move the bill, and I'm happy to support it today.
2124	Pan	Richard	96	KTS25NPAjyE	1814	1830	There's also another part about being within 100 miles of the person's home. I'm not sure, I'm quite entirely comfortable with that right now in the sense that there's some conditions where there may be more patients and in fact the trial may be closed because they have sufficient patients.
2125	Bonta	Rob	85	51wXJ30ZLf4	1694	1717	I am a retired law enforcement professional, a conservative, that's here supporting a cannabis bill. And I'm very proud to be in this position because it's been 19 years that we have voted in the fact that we believe that cannabis treats medical conditions in a very legitimate pathway.
2126	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	pvvkVbDJBVE	499	534	Under consideration of the daily file, we will skip over governor's appointments at the moment till we have a full house. We will go to Senate third reading. Pass on file. Under Assembly third reading item 12, item 12. Senator Bates, do you wish take up item 12?
2127	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	b7XHatlYhkw	1668	1684	And the hope and expectation is that, they will do their due diligence and investigate before this is something that becomes a public knowledge to protect against allegations that are false or otherwise, misleading.
2128	Hancock	Loni	98	RplCDWdFT8I	199	221	And I welcome the clarification, and simplification, of the penalty structure. That is gonna be important. So, thank you very much for your efforts in this very complicated area of the law. And I'm happy to support your bill with the amendments. Senator Stone?
2129	Alejo	Luis	9	KEeiqVKf9vU	131	150	If we don't fix our existing neighborhoods, dense cities will sprawl outward, worsening and causing problems like traffic and greenhouse gas emissions. This bill has received bipartisan support in the Assembly and the Senate and is supported by a host of cities. The California Chamber of Commerce, CBIA, brown housing advocates.
2130	De Leon	Kevin	102	8-bIXhKX8x4	527	540	So I would venture to say, not being, and I am cognizant, not being an economic adviser, or an investment, chief investment adviser, that these are holdings that are actually losing great value as we speak today.
2131	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	NULZ8SoEhtM	801	815	That motionpasses with seven to zero. For the next of file items, I have file item 18, AB 1112 by Ms. Lopez. The motion was pass to higher education. That bill passed three to one. The chair was an aye.
2132	Bates	Pat	58	0yf1SfBcDOs	2390	2416	There have been a myriad of bills that have come forward to let them weigh in on this again. If we have the intellect, and I believe we do, to structure one of those ballot initiatives, that would set forth some conditions in terms of the risks that are here in terms of money that's already been appropriated, we could accomplish something and draw the people back into this, I think very important project for the future.
2133	Mullin	Kevin	31	5Qw_YsDfvQ4	1236	1265	Members, without objection the first roll will be open for co-authors. The clerk will open the roll. All members vote who wish to vote adding onto ACR 42.

The resolution is adopted
2134	Hertzberg	Robert	99	8_h1Rf31Czc	672	683	Certainly we know in this whole Good Samaritan law, people are having a chilling effect and they don't want to engage cuz they're afraid to get involved, they're afraid they might have a problem, even though we have protected them and given them immunity.

AB 953 would create in addition to the collection of data would create a racial and identity profiling advisory board this multi-state board that would have diverse voices of experts would include social scientists policing experts representatives of law enforcement civil rights organization
2136	Beall	Jim	92	6rjOa1qOGPA	1691	1721	The normal course of action is relinquishments are approved by the legislature and they go through a process. Caltrans gets that, and then Caltrans will negotiate a relinquishment agreement that will entail donating money to the county to do improvements. To upgrade the road, correct? Are you planning to upgrade the road with those monies?
2137	Gipson	Mike	28	SQe4IQVjZKc	991	1005	We need to make sure that we do everything we can to provide that kind of leadership even speaking truth to power. To the stakeholders, to the Auditor, thank you very much. Madam Auditor, I have one question for you in terms of next steps.
2138	Hill	Jerry	66	mZDplXo566U	593	616	So we required a, we passed a bill last year to require the PUC to look at physical activity, physical security, and I had reservations if they were capable to do that. But I'm concerned about cyber security. So do you, you know, how will you do, train the people? How will you add value? And how is that something that you'll be able to work through in your rulemaking?

Item number three, In-home Supportive Services. Ginni Bella Navarre, Managing Principal Analyst, Health and Human Service and Legislative Analyst's Office. And if the members don't mind I'd like to have everyone give their- did I miss somebody?
2140	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	csda2pMKJRU	226	236	I think they're not gonna work any harder than they work. I mean I, I, I happen to think grocery, grocery workers are extremely hard working. They're very good at what they do.
2141	Dodd	Bill	71	yhT6yC928zE	61	87	I mean, this ... I don't know. It's mind-boggling to me that a company like Accenture ... Unless what you said at the very top of this thing, that we failed to plan, staff and manage this program, if that just gets Accenture off the hook, then I guess we're going down the right road. But I still think that there's plenty of problems
2142	De Leon	Kevin	102	PcpmEqtLP1M	222	236	We'll hear today from the California Manufacturers and Technology Association, who back in 2006 told the Los Angeles Times there is no way to get to these targets except by stopping the use of energy.
2143	Bonilla	Susan	3	CH2-PAA9VHE	809	823	These include, among others, standards which protect patients, standards that preserve the environment, and protect water resources, standards that ensure that workers in the cannabis industry are treated fairly, and receive equal protections under the labor code.
2144	Block	Marty	59	qnIAoFuwUn0	1528	1547	Well, actually I'll let the LAO speak to that. I mean, our, our, our options are many. We can, we can as subcommittee recommend to the full budget committee  that they adopt this block grant proposal or any pieces thereof, and then the full budget committee will, consider it and vote on it.
2145	Burke	Autumn	6	KcpO7Oo2ci0	1284	1303	However my biggest concern is what happens, not kind of like we're saying, not the first year we're implement it, but the subsequent years. If healthcare, if insurers just keep raising the rates, and then unfortunately employers that want to maintain health insurance won't be able to. So, I think once we find a solution to that,
2146	Morrell	Mike	51	uymj8kL8SYs	226	243	I'm here to present Senate bill one ninety eight which will repeal the chapter one five, one-point-five of the public resources code. This section of the code was established in two thousand eleven by a AB29X to create the fire fee.
2147	Beall	Jim	92	84LBK3fic7E	2090	2108	So my feeling is we've got to get to that point where we're just maintaining the roads in an efficient manner on a pavement management system and then repair those roads in an appropriate manner and that would be actually to the benefit of the tax payer on the long term basis.
2148	Huff	Bob	105	aItBzVMycEU	1283	1309	Likewise I took a trip with CP to Canada. In Canada we have some agreement with Quebec. Canada is very good on renewables, but they've got all this hydro and by the way again we don't score hydro. So why is that we as California want to take the burden of balancing a very noble goal of helping reduce greenhouse gases, but those gases don't stop at California border.
2149	Leyva	Connie	62	cvDmVx__4xs	663	692	SB477 would ensure that low-income disabled persons and seniors who live in mobile homes are not at risk of losing their home because of property taxes. The property, the State Property Tax Postponement Program helps ensure that these lower income residents and households who qualify for the program do not lose their home to a tax sale. I accept the amendments that are recommended in the analysis and also let me kindly mention the work of the committee staff. I greatly appreciate that. Thank you.
2150	Stone	Jeff	26	oIK91dkxix0	1126	1145	But, if you look the Welfare and Institutions Code, there seems to be, at least from my perspective, strong legislative oversight and strong legislative timelines that I think support the concerns that Senator McGuire has very well articulated.
2151	Harper	Matthew	14	8g5e-OGL0_Y	910	931	Thank you Mr. Speaker. I rise to adjourn in memory of Henry T Segerstrom from who passed away last week at the age of 91. When he was born in 1923 most in Los Angeles considered Orange County a back water. I hope we've overcome that sense but he helped turn it into a powerhouse for retail as well as
2152	Pavley	Fran	104	4MjmF7EnXtg	505	520	All right. Thank you very much. Any opposition to the bill? Or in support for the bill? Anyone here in the audience? Any other comments or questions by members? Go ahead.
2153	Dahle	Brian	47	DaiegGG5yrM	1530	1546	The other thing I wanted to talk about is that, the devils in the details. If we're gonna be the world leader in California and showing the rest of, not only the other states but the rest of the world. I think the Governor's going to Paris here soon and he's gonna be talking about California's lead in this.
2154	Harper	Matthew	14	8g5e-OGL0_Y	931	948	the performing arts. Henry came from humble and hardworking family that came to Orange County in the late 1800's. By 1940's they ran the largest lima bean farm in the United States. World war two broke out while Henry was studying at Stanford University and he suspended his studies and enlisted in the US army. In
2155	Hernandez	Ed	103	7vLzhqaEeV8	459	467	Okay so for the 300 million estimated to meet, is this going to be estimated to meet the demand for the treatment for all the Medi-Cal enrollees or do you anticipate there's gonna be more?
2156	Thurmond	Tony	4	Hc7WoMlUJqU	1309	1322	And I was, my intent was only to ask if that's what you really wanted to know. Around reducing the salaries. And when the word restructuring got used it, I, I didn't think you meant restructuring of an org, of a company but you meant you wanted to be able to talk about how to lower the salary.
2157	Hueso	Ben	48	r49jrzf4Gi8	1065	1086	Like anything else, I expect that it'll make sense over a longer period of time as they start to see revenue from that investment and overall help the district and anytime we have public agencies that are finding ways, creative ways, to get revenue in the long run. I think that's...we have to at least give them the opportunity.
2158	Hernandez	Ed	103	o6dY6yB1_H8	1581	1594	Under the bill, these kids' networks would provide a patient in family-centered health home for children with eligibility conditions. The state would contract with Kids Network beginning in 2018.
2159	Stone	Jeff	26	7VfcnWx6nzU	901	915	However, you brought up a couple points that I think are worthy of discussion. One percent of the proceeds goes to your association, your members, to train them to basically potentially implement SB443.
2160	Mitchell	Holly	64	-t-fzOOeiys	193	216	Thank you very much. Given the fact that the department is still in negotiations with the plans and looking at alternatives, the Committee will hold this item open. And let me just say for the public, the fact that the Committee this early in the budget process, holding items open should not be an indicator of support or opposition, merely that we're holding the items open for future consideration, post may revise.
2161	Gatto	Mike	46	5EeaivfMcyY	1042	1063	And I wasn't aware of the long story leading into this. I'm a little troubled by the fact the legislature, our colleagues, our predecessors passed this court reporting statute however many years ago that they did. I'm assuming it's was well before I got here, but that the board then took an action which was a legislative action.
2162	Cooley	Ken	45	gmSplS1IxCE	369	382	So there's greater accountability, it protects, as my colleague from Oakland stated, local control, the power of cities and municipalities to control the quality of life issues of whether is it or is it not a dispensary?
2163	Glazer	Steve	10481	sxH5Xtvq9A4	655	675	My question is not just unique to this issue but to others as well. Any thoughts to putting a ten year sunset on this to give it a good chance for the data to be collected and analyzed, and then for the matter to be reevaluated ten years from now to see if it's still something that's required. Have you given any thought to that?
2164	McGuire	Mike	93	suW9diU5Tzo	2062	2080	Thank you. Thank you so much. I appreciate everyone's cooperation. And again, not trying to be pushy on that, are there any individuals that would like to be able speak, opposed to the bill? I would like to be able to bring it back to the committee and see if we have any comments or questions. Mr. Vice Chair.
2165	Nguyen	Janet	65	0XEmXVzSg6Q	995	1014	I believe this designation will provide Californians an opportunity reflect on the tragedy of black April and to honor those who lost their lives defending freedom and democracy during the Vietnam War where 58,000 American soldiers and millions of south Vietnamese armed forces and civilians lost their lives.
2166	Wood	Jim	72	y1QKa01q6Wg	2298	2315	Thank you, Mr. Chair. And thank you senator Lara for bringing this bill forward. To me, this shouldn't be about winners or losers. I think we need to have a way to sustain a system that helps everyone within the system. As a healthcare provider, the overall public health is really, really important to me.
2167	Lara	Ricardo	107	TSE2ocY_LpM	522	536	perhaps we can have Assemblymember Dababneh in his close, highlight what some of those cost savings are. So we'll make sure we do that. If there's no further questions or comments, Mr. Dababneh, feel free to close.
2168	Bates	Pat	58	4HBwd3okHJI	705	722	Thank you. Any additional witnesses in opposition? Back to the committee, then. Any I think I'm the only one. Do I have a question? Ms. Bonilla, would you like to close?
2169	Leno	Mark	60	vpNS8YXwTNY	1972	1998	I'm not sure that we can go into greater detail, but again we're not giving any additional authority to any agencies. We're just saying that everything they have currently should be in furtherance of the 50/50/50. So as Senator Pavley mentioned, these are set in new updated standards as we look out further decades from where we've been because we've been so successful in getting to the earlier standards that we've set.
2170	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	vpNS8YXwTNY	1960	1972	I just want to make sure that we aren't going to essentially go overboard and thus relinquish some of our I think, you know, mandatory oversight and other protection.
2171	Weber	Shirley	44	nY2N1xKF-1M	696	748	Thank you Ms. Melendez. We will now begin the process. I want to invite Keely Bosler from the Department of Finance and Mac Taylor from the LAO to come forward to present the governor's budget to us. I want to remind my members that we will hear them and then we will have questions of them. Keep in mind that we have a 2 hour hearing process, to 12:30. You will have an opportunity, at all of your hearings within your sub committees, to have access to LAO and the office of finance as well, where you'll be able to drill down in greater detail in your specific subject areas. Once again, welcome, good to see all you again and welcome to the process. Thank you very much for being here.
2172	Beall	Jim	92	zKRXexcG8LM	302	318	And of course, we realize that some of these children warrant some medication, but the state must ensure that these powerful drugs do not replace other effective and necessary treatments.
2173	Bates	Pat	58	U-gbn_qz8sg	1331	1348	Because the concern I have is refineries respond to the market we're creating here by reducing our fuel consumption. They're going to be exporting more which will certainly keep them financially whole, but also can be a significant impact to the price.
2174	Wolk	Lois	94	qqrfcEEn454	1313	1336	I'll call for public comment at that point. Thank you. Maybe. All right, thank you very much for all of that, and those of you who gave good public comments as well. All right, let's move on to the Central Valley Flood Protection Board. Who do we have?
2175	Williams	Das	12	VsFc4cEmvwc	1002	1026	Before you move on to the other solutions, I wanted to ask a question on the last slide because this is a slide you guys put out there a lot. I think people walk away with maybe an inaccurate impression. Because what you don't talk about by putting out the slide is that we don't just have overgeneration in renewables.
2176	Thurmond	Tony	4	eiRf682j8LU	2084	2099	So, if anything, this is an opportunity to complement STEM and to give us a way to save money. I would say let's not think of it as an unfunded mandate, rather, this is another way for us to achieve education. It's a good investment that could help to lower the achievement gap.
2177	Wolk	Lois	94	gAWN8j6c6Vc	614	632	Thank you, Mr. Chair and members. 551 will establish a new state policy, which will insure that all future state policies, regulations and guidelines are developed in a manner that ensures water use as an, that water use is an energy efficient as possible and energy use and generation is as water efficient as possible.
2178	Hertzberg	Robert	99	XAJHKAVYVrw	310	325	Where are you gonna get this level of cluck for buck where you can take people who fundamentally want to work, who wanna provide this level of public service. Who wanna start their career to learn about dealing with stuff on a day to day basis.
2179	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	Y1vJCPBhcQM	1191	1214	You probably do not need breasts or a prostate to continue to be a firefighter. I'm not sure, somebody may correct me on that. However, you still get a permanent disability rating that says that was worth something. For a prostate its about 16%, and for a breast is 0%, unless you still are of a child bearing age, in which case it can be up to 5%. Because the breasts are necessary for other things.
2180	Salas	Rudy	34	fmIaR7hDQ6w	409	425	Yeah, I have a couple of water town halls out there. And we're looking to see what we can secure with some of the grant money that was talked about earlier, or some of the capital projects to help offset some of that. But, a lot of communities are dealing with that up and down the entire state.
2181	Cooley	Ken	45	1NZUtvyVKUY	1407	1418	If I may jump in just before my witness, I want to thank Yuni Lyndon for her work on this. There are amendments that are proposed, and so I am accepting committee amendments, and I failed to state that at the outset, and thank you for your good work, Yuni.
2182	Quirk	Bill	23	0lsNxjB7bP8	1242	1262	One of the areas I can just think about is using the data to say, gee, at this time of day and this location, we need to have a lot of drivers, let's encourage people to be there. I think Mr. Chau thinks his bill allows it. I don't think it does, but I don't think we should be passing a bill where that's uncertain.
2183	McCarty	Kevin	22	GcMV__uVRbo	1688	1704	Okay, can you go back, and just for the record, outline the four year enrollment growth? Did you say it's 10,000 students over the next four years? So the budget year plus three more years?
2184	Chiu	David	7	YQMcgz0QqiY	975	982	So again, I don't want to dictate that, I think it's up to cities to decide that, but we simply want the cities and counties to make that decision.
2185	Leno	Mark	60	xusZRk9gg60	1650	1670	Additionally, $12 million would be attributable to the income taxes and administered by the Franchise Tax Board, 3 million administered by the Department of Insurance. The compromise is that we just deal with the $3 million for each of two years
2186	Hertzberg	Robert	99	sv9CTiV9bwA	1331	1342	I'm just gonna go out of order real quickly, but could we do this in LA county? Could we do this? You're capturing a tremendous, get our Mike on. This is Gary Hildebrand.
2187	Cooley	Ken	45	Gv0uyUPdJmA	736	744	This bill is designed to kind of set some legal authority under our own Affordable Care Act, so they can set up these plans if they feel they need that authority.
2188	Fuller	Jean	49	519YUTER2IM	1863	1884	Okay so that part's a little better. But, I still don't understand, there will be increased costs. So have you done any studies, do you know what the increased costs will be over time, to who, the rate payers, utilities, to improve this old technology of these olds plants, as new ones are built.
2189	Gaines	Ted	24	BDjsPtF4Upk	1432	1454	I think we can move forward even with some legislation that could clarify some issues here, but the bottom line comes down, in my mind, to the patient, and we've got situations where patients are ending up with bills that they didn't expect they had to pay for, and they're having to pay for those bills.
2190	Mayes	Chad	79	dQgHkZmLQFo	1430	1443	Well, thank you. I'm going to start off with AB 1202 if that's okay. I want to start off on a positive note. Just want to start off to let you know that I will be accepting the proposed committee amendments.
2191	Baker	Catharine	74	zOcsFgJ-ERA	737	762	including Mr. Diaz, early in this year, both for, and against the bill. As well as faith leaders from just about every faith I could think of in my communities as late as this morning to ask on this issue. And I've shared that with you, because I've had concerns about the bill from the beginning, and I appreciate that you and Senators Monning and Wolk have been very willing to discuss them.
2192	Hall	Isadore	1	nqU0Ufhmqoo	13	41	Yes. Thank you, Madam Chair and Members. SB 232 will allow a state appointed trustee or administrator of a school district in receivership to request the advice and assistance of the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence. The collaborative was created in 2013 to assist school districts transitioning to the new Local Control Funding Formula.
2193	McCarty	Kevin	22	J7_DGCQOA4w	1208	1233	So we're gonna line up over here on the side. Will you please form a line over there.  So we'll try to do one minute per individual if we could. Thank you.
2194	Melendez	Melissa	41	SuJy5eE040k	28	38	And it's a court of their own peers. It's law enforcement that's involved that mentors them, councils them. It's completely run by other kids who have gone through the program.
2195	Bonta	Rob	85	4IkAjWExsPI	43	62	Item 15, bill AB 1114, Assembly Member Bonilla. Item 19, AB 1149, Assembly Member Wood. And item 22, AB 1216, Assembly Member Bonta. And for clarity, removed from the calendar the, the following bills have all been removed from today's agenda.
2196	Roth	Richard	106	xQtK7XDQgbs	1625	1641	as opposed to 15,000 if we're trying to sort of balance the educational playing field here in California. And again, maybe my thought is misplaced, and if so, I stand to be corrected. And I have a very thick skin.
2197	Mendoza	Tony	52	0MzTgkt-Llc	1042	1064	SCA8 has strong and effective cost control by restricting funding to the expanded board on the 2020-2021 pre expansion levels. To address concerns, the bill was amended to permit adjustments annually for changes in the consumer price index. This bill has bipartisan support and I would respectively ask for your aye vote.
2198	Dababneh	Matthew	50	w8nI6ofQavM	112	126	They are taking state taxpayer money that belongs to all of us... and do research for the goodwill of our whole community, we are not telling them they have to dismantle a program, we're going to send a new bureaucrat in to administer this.
2199	Weber	Shirley	44	XQwWN6GsS_M	740	753	And so this is to strengthen that program that's there to expand it to meet their needs in the central valley in terms of the fact that healthcare is 31% lower in central valley than any other part of California.
2200	Williams	Das	12	dQgHkZmLQFo	391	419	These are good measures and really appreciate the assembly member from the East Bay bringing this important issue to the Committee. Methane has not been addressed in the same substantive form that carbon emissions have in the state. But of course, they have the same result. The great thing about reduction of methane emissions is there is tremendous potential for job growth from the reduction of methane emissions.
2201	Mullin	Kevin	31	AAng3WP84Ks	1125	1157	Members, thank you for your wrapt attention on Mr. Dodd's presentation. Seeing and hearing no discussion on this item, the clerk will open the roll. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. The clerk will close the roll and tally the vote. Ayes 53, nos 20. The resolution is adopted.
2202	Bonilla	Susan	3	mCVaWE-xXHw	1560	1581	or perhaps come into an office setting, and provide their services there. We know it's going on, and this is just a way to help make sure that it's actually going to have a service permit that will help regulate it. It's also going to require the board under the oversight of the Office of Professional Exam Services to conduct a review
2203	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	37JGlYuk31E	472	485	That doesn't affect just those kids, it affects an entire community when you shut down as few urgent care facilities, or as few clinics or hospitals as we have. We come from different places.
2204	Beall	Jim	92	AXQlG4R7h08	1768	1783	So it'll be, there's clunky stuff with probation, in a lot of these hand-off kinds of things. And I'm certainly going to understand their budget thing now. I'll have to look into that as a member of the budget sub-committee with Senator Anderson.
2205	Gomez	Jimmy	80	RsqrHgBrOM8	401	416	Thank you, Mr. Wilk. As I mentioned, this is a suspense bill. Any witnesses in support? Individuals from the public in support? Witnesses in opposition? Individuals from the public in opposition? Department of finance.
2206	Gallagher	James	108	95pquWUVfBw	372	398	And so for NARAL to try and put the black mark on them and say you guys are providing misinformation to people, not a one of these women would do that because again they were in the same position themselves and to try and make them look bad by this report I think is completely, I take great umbrage with that.
2207	Brown	Cheryl	13	DgVvXUz7n-U	511	535	My mother, my mother Melba Mentor, who helped to get many folks that served in this house elected, she was six months on hospice because they said she can't make it. Six months later they took her off of hospice, but that experience showed me that doctors don't know everything.
2208	Bonilla	Susan	3	zWDrC8wHRhs	1075	1093	But we, we have I guess the rate. It is lower, but it's based on our overall income in the state. And so, it just seems to me that, I dunno. it doesn't seem fair.
2209	Hernandez	Ed	103	TtbWmbg1NYI	2114	2125	Current vote count is 8-0, that bill is out. Item number six, AB 1147 do pass as amended to appropriations. Current vote count is 7-0, call the absent members.
2210	Gomez	Jimmy	80	BIu6jaBGJCE	897	920	Thank you, Mr. Gallagher. Any other questions or comments from the committee members? Seeing none, we appreciate the Department of Finance input. We see that this bill would not exceed 150,000 in cost and therefore is a due past recommendation to the floor of the assembly.
2211	Roth	Richard	106	zr4fqdcgBEU	168	187	I think it's pretty clear both from finance's perspective and practical application and I think our concern is, and I don't want to belabor this, we need to have the discussion as part of next year's budget process. But I certainly think, for one, that we need to talk about having a surplus property disposal fund or
2212	Stone	Mark	20	1ddkqgmLsnY	351	365	So, ok, the motion is do pass as amended to rules and that is the motion we do have a motion and a second. Any questions/comments from Committee Members.
2213	Hernandez	Ed	103	Zz925hDmty8	117	125	I mean, what are some of the other alternatives as opposed to setting a precedence right now? Cause I'm starting to have some of the similar concerns that the chair is having right now.
2214	Hernandez	Ed	103	Zz925hDmty8	99	117	Yeah, okay. So, saying that, and I'm trying to figure out, I understand your concerns by setting a precedent. And by allowing the voters, I'm hearing your comments about reason why you want to do it. You want to put it in front of the voters.
2215	Gallagher	James	108	g465sM88Jms	1974	1990	Well, that's, I mean that's not what I'm really concerned about here. I'm more concerned about, you know, how often is this actually happening. How much is this a, a problem in this state? And I just haven't heard any real objective data that suggests that this is happening throughout California, I mean your example was from Chicago, so.
2216	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	jMfO9319uXo	239	252	Our next panel, and we're actually almost running on time, is drones in the right of privacy. And we have with us Samantha Corbin from the privacy rights clearing house and Lee Tien with the electronic frontier foundation.
2217	Bonta	Rob	85	Zz925hDmty8	129	175	Yeah I think we're running out of options. We're here in what we understand are extraordinary circumstances in the last minute without a lot of time for you to prep. We understand that, it's not ideal, it's not what we want. But we're here because it's the only option we can see as a path forward to keep San Leandro Hospital open. We've taken other steps and let me just be clear, San Leandro Hospital was an Alameda hospital were recently aligned with Alameda Health System to align them with a bigger system that could provide more financial security and support. That was a step we took that we thought was necessary to keep the hospital open. It hasn't proven enough, and so we've talked about other options, like the ones Senator Moorlach so appropriately raised trying to sell some of the property in real estate. Those didn't pan out, so now we're here.
2218	Allen	Benjamin	70	wx8xyIQVojY	410	429	Well, really, really appreciate your very, very thoughtful approach and the issues brought up. I've learned a lot from this. So thank you so much, to the two of you. Thank you. Alright, let's turn on now to kind of looking, expanding out a bit to really deep dive into this voter turnout in Los Angeles County issue.
2219	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	9eA3HqZp1ws	1009	1035	Is there any debate or discussion on this item? Seeing and hearing none, is there any objection substituting a unanimous roll call? Seeing and hearing none, ayes 34 no's zero. Ayes 33, no's zero. That measure is, that resolution is adopted. File item 8. Senator Fuller do wish to proceed with file item 8?
2220	Wieckowski	Bob	55	Oggr1OKYFzQ	805	829	they get knocked back down to $9 for their take home pay, so this corrects that. This isn't the case even in communities that have raised their own minimum wage to a higher level, and this 501 addresses that and also reduces the garnishment rate from 25% to 10%. And advocates who work every day in the trenches with working class families
2221	Hernandez	Roger	37	ukB39_tnTUw	1652	1663	AB 254 will directly address this, and help give a voice to more voters. Statewide consistent election times will help build positive voting habits, and make elections more accessible to all voters. I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
2222	Bonta	Rob	85	U5NUS2rxwgk	796	814	Okay, I want to thank the members. Dr. Wood, thank you for your participation today and all of your comments and input. Mr. Patterson, thank you. Mr. Chairman, it was a pleasure. I want to thank our staff and all of our colleagues who participated in today's,what I believe was a very robust, very helpful dialogue.
2223	Dodd	Bill	71	dKlfu24NXRk	1707	1726	Yes, like the author, Mr. Mullin, I served on Metropolitan Transportation Commission and BADA, and time after time, we got reports from staff about all the dollars that were being lost throughout the Bay Area in our toll bridges, and I just think-- I thank, excuse me, Mr. Mullin for bringing this bill forward.
2224	Mitchell	Holly	64	leLv2BAfLGY	241	257	Marty Omoto, California Disability Senior Community Action Network, I'm also a family member. Back in the day, when in the 70s I was working as a direct care worker here in Sacramento. And trying to bring my sister up here. And those were the days when it seemed as if the Lanaman Act and
2225	Monning	Bill	25	Tf4H31hlCr4	1137	1156	And I think your testimony and the positive experiences, we need to just amplify the success stories. And for me, a cost benefit analysis, the investment in swimming lessons,
2226	Jones	Brian	42	cKW0dtBGGXY	2143	2153	Senator, thank you very much for working with the opposition, and taking the online and catalog labeling off. I was absolutely opposed to the bill with that in there.
2227	Hancock	Loni	98	B0PWp2aeSfk	271	291	In addition, I'd like to point out that there are, I believe, a maximum of 300 correctional officers there and there are at least several thousand vacant correctional officer positions in the system.
2228	Anderson	Joel	57	u9WQRBoV7yg	1517	1535	My community of Alpine rallied behind Kylie and her family. Pink ribbons were tied to every post and every tree that lined Alpine Boulevard. Fund-raisers were held for the family and signs with Kylie's picture were placed in local shops and businesses
2229	Lara	Ricardo	107	kyRwF6Xn7UY	217	227	Moving on to AB 1301, voting rights, pre-clearance, do pass to the Senate Floor. We will substitute the roll of AB 2, that bill is approved on a five to two vote, with Republicans voting no.
2230	Hancock	Loni	98	B0PWp2aeSfk	248	270	That facility has recently in the last few weeks had a report come out from the Department of Public Health that is really shocking. It talks about cockroaches, rats, standing water in kitchen areas. It is an old decrepit facility and the community in which it's located would very much like to see it closed as well.
2231	Chau	Ed	116	B4ry1_3tU0U	1197	1217	The term you that you're debating is whether or not the term "independent value" is confusing or vague or ambiguous in the bill or whatever. But, I don't think it is, because if you think that, that term is used to describe, let's say, an adjustment of status, then you're allowed to collect fees in advance. So, I just don't see, you know.
2232	Wieckowski	Bob	55	scqfU4UsUAo	2239	2258	First, there is this, the means test. And you shouldn't just gloss over this. You have, you first have to submit 6 months of wages to the court to determine what your average income has been and if you make too much money, or you have too many assets you do not qualify to file a bankruptcy petition.
2233	Leno	Mark	60	aYmlFd2X1yI	718	745	a violation of any applicable work rule, minimum-wage law if the local entity with jurisdiction in the matter has cited or has initiated an investigation against the employer for the same violation. Might you just add, neither shall the local entity with jurisdiction in the matter issue a citation against an employer for a violation if the labor of commissioner has cited them?
2234	Liu	Carol	63	EeHY3lg6hXA	359	373	check in about how we are doing and, it, you know, how our students are doing, and I know no parents, etc. And I know for me in my district,  the LCAP process was a little bumpy. Not exactly what you would wish for.
2235	Gipson	Mike	28	r0_c68VZXFY	1099	1110	We have a police commission in the city of Los Angeles now that where people can go and lodge their concerns with respect to injustices they may see or have been confronted with.
2236	Pan	Richard	96	rEreViIPqP0	1220	1237	Each group has its own unique traditions in carrying out the observances as holiday. Again, thank you for joining me in the Asian Pacific Islander Legislative Caucus and over 5.5 million Asian Pacific Islander Californians in celebrating the year the sheep. With that, I respectfully ask for an aye vote on this resolution.
2237	Allen	Benjamin	70	zqM_Vy0kspE	110	128	Used oil is one of the largest sources of hazardous materials, and reduced oil changes will directly reduce the pollution threat and management costs associated with used oil. We know that this standard will benefit consumers by improving gas mileage, reducing engine wear and tear, and reducing the need for frequent oil changes.
2238	Bates	Pat	58	9SvrzWegmgM	1037	1051	I would think that's going on now, because I've noticed, where I live, it's right over the ocean. And there, with the hot weather, we now have that small brown band. Haven't seen it a lot, so we know that the inversion layer is there.
2239	Pavley	Fran	104	b4USpkALPiM	392	405	The other thing about AB 32, and this is the whole thing, in fact only half of this is AB 32. The rest is filled with Arnold Schwarzenegger executive orders that are consistent with our 2050 targets.
2240	Garcia	Eduardo	38	h4u4YccC9Z8	1105	1118	So we've been working closely with a former colleague of all of you, former senator and now Congressman Juan Vargas, who represents the border region of Calexico and San Isidro points of entry.
2241	Hernandez	Ed	103	AtJ4r5Cv5ko	578	589	The other thing too is if you look at the state of California, we are way behind the rest of the states for raising the tobacco tax. I like to amend it to $4 a pack if we could but, you know, I'm supportive of the two.
2242	Calderon	Ian Charles	115	22ufHgqGK-A	1641	1657	AB 691 one addresses this issue by striking a balance between providing clear path for fiduciaris to access relevant information to handle the deceased person's estate, while respecting the privacy choices of not just the deceased person but those with whom the deceased was communicating with.
2243	Hernandez	Ed	103	2iFsom3zoYY	1573	1595	Okay and do you have any response, I mean, do you have any thought, I mean, I don't have any answer and I'm just curious because it just seems to be working sort of in the general overall health of Medi-Cal, with managed care, especially with the cos and/or the Two-Plan health system, and I wasn't sure in dentistry which, where was best utilized?
2244	Roth	Richard	106	5WD5y8t5m5U	287	299	I mean, what I am not without some experience in this area, since I've been up here in Sacramento with some criminal prosecutions and the desire to launch an independent administrative investigation,
2245	Block	Marty	59	n5MXFS_19l0	1048	1066	There will be a criminal prosecution perhaps, which begs the question, should our campuses do criminal searches because that's how they'll really find out if they're bringing in a rapist or somebody who has stabbed somebody else. I'll support the bill because I don't think it does harm.
2246	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	9BeGgNFnShg	1795	1816	Clearly there's a problem at the school assuming, these allegations, I'll put on my lawyer hat, assuming what you say is true, has anything has there been any effort to sanction this behavior that has not succeeded because of something we might be able to do to put some teeth into the law.
2247	Roth	Richard	106	SCWpb6PxRGE	991	1023	I tried to limit this in a way that, hopefully, encourages business to use the certified access specialist process, the CASP process. Because whatever it is that we have been doing over the last 10 or 15 or 20 years has, is not, is obviously not working. And so we need to do everything that we can do within our power as a legislature, to encourage business, to drive business to casts.
2248	Nielsen	Jim	68	Ydll29eHOng	200	222	Have rolled back the gains made in the crime victim's movement dating clear back to the 1970's. Victims truly feel aggrieved now just about as much so from its own Legislature and individual's like this particular appointee. I urge a no vote.
2249	Weber	Shirley	44	BMNgYibzIuk	496	519	It's unreasonable to ask a citizen to look at over a thousand LCAPs and see what's going on in California schools. It ought to be in one place, and this is all that's there, and since it's interesting because the Department of Education is not giving push back, they're embracing it. So I assume that everyone else will embrace it as well.
2250	Roth	Richard	106	5WD5y8t5m5U	299	318	And, of course, one of our concerns at the time was that significant witnesses might choose not to speak to us and exercise their rights accorded them in the criminal process. And without the ability to grant immunity. They don't talk to you, right?
2251	Hueso	Ben	48	GUxOzh3Wh0Q	1462	1483	Since the introduction of biomass, the fire departments now can deny permits to burn waste because they have an alternative source to send the waste to. So, in light of that and understanding that without biomass there will be conditions in our communities that will exacerbate the quality of health for the people living out there.
2252	Mullin	Kevin	31	oyj26fO_o0A	51	67	With rising health care costs and an increasing MediCal eligible population across California, there's a need to strengthen the capacity of our current health care system to address the health needs of our most vulnerable populations at lower costs.
2253	Bonta	Rob	85	CRMwg6_WO3E	551	574	Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members. I rise in support of AB170. I want to thank my colleague from Glendale for working so closely with stakeholders and the Assembly Health Committee to address concerns. Thanks to the author, this is a bill that ensures that parents are fully informed of their rights regarding the newborn genetic disease screening program and simultaneously maintains the scientific integrity of the program. I urge your aye vote.
2254	Wagner	Donald	88	-9yM4LrfOs0	135	172	I'll redact the middle part of the information and I'll leave the name and the zip code there for the public. I think that's the appropriate balance, assuming even we have a right to balance second amendment rights, which are pretty cut and dried. But for purposes of this bill I don't have to decide whether or not we shouldn't balance things. I think the bill is making a balance I can accept, so anyway. That's a long way of saying this bill does an absolutely fantastic job of balancing the concerns and deserves support from this committee. Thank you Mr. Gray.
2255	McGuire	Mike	93	D1U0Ojzunqk	1928	1951	We have about three-hundred and ten peace officer rangers and game wardens in this state. And he could put all three-hundred and ten on the issue of marijuana, and still not be caught up. We have under funded our environmental protection as well as public safety in this state when it comes to marijuana, medical marijuana enforcement.
2256	Beall	Jim	92	Ol0PhdDSV8c	68	81	So, I'm looking forward to this hearing from our agencies and advocates also about how the programs are working so far and whether or not we need to make any tweaks or whatever you want to call it - modifications.
2257	Jones	Brian	42	5EeaivfMcyY	1707	1724	Senator Mendoza, you have 3 ayes, 5 nos. The majors on call. You have some members absent. So we'll leave it on call until the end of the hearing. If at the end of the hearing it does fail, would you appreciate reconsideration?
2258	Wolk	Lois	94	_JbASqkciSI	1525	1545	The only thing we're suggesting to the language is that CARB be required to work in consultation with the scientific advisory panel, so that we come up with the tools for GHG quantification. We think it's important that there be that marriage. So, we're proposing that and the last, on page--
2259	Bloom	Richard	2	bKCoiLHe7ac	1041	1062	Language in this trailer bill sets up a criteria where water in a particular community is neither adequate, reliable nor safe. Is that one collective criteria or could the determination be made on each individual criteria?
2260	Baker	Catharine	74	hoyJIOxa8uU	602	617	Thank you. We'll take additional comments of, support from the audience, from public comment. If you can come to the microphone and identify your name. And oh, who you're with.
2261	Leno	Mark	60	pchCRkcA1Ic	1136	1156	By passing our 2010 bill, the legislature helped consumers save hundreds of millions of dollars in the small group market. It's not very often that we actually get to do something about containing healthcare costs. This bill will now apply the cost-saving effect of market transparency to large group insurance.
2262	Roth	Richard	106	7aIanLUJ17E	1666	1682	Isn't most of the classroom instruction, doesn't most of it pertain to the rules of the road, and the DMVs rules, and you can look at my hair and tell that it's been decades since I've done this. But am I not right?
2263	Lara	Ricardo	107	QRS30WyiTXk	1396	1419	Thank you, Madam Vice Chair and Members. This bill would appropriate approximately $1.47 million to the Victims Compensation and Government Claims Board for the payment of 113 state claims. 110 of these claims are for reissuing Stale-Dated Warrants, which are checks that were never cashed.
2264	Williams	Das	12	VsFc4cEmvwc	1093	1111	Why can't we also make steps to make sure that we're curtailing that, not wasting that gas, or not wasting our money in the middle of the day instead of taking advantage of the solar that we're already paying for?
2265	Wood	Jim	72	YSUIHVlik4w	1664	1677	And about three-quarters of this was in infrastructure, with the pie chart there. And you said that most of it was tied up in a couple of projects that are now on hold.
2266	Gaines	Ted	24	IKESHE_NOXc	709	742	So, it is evidence of a transformation that can occur with individuals when they have a mentor and someone who cares and loves them. And this program Shoulder-to-Shoulder has done great things in our community and we're hoping that it can be replicated throughout the State of California. So take for this opportunity to recognize Shoulder-to-Shoulder and all the hard work by these individuals and in terms of the National Mentoring Month, I would ask for an aye-vote. Thank you.
2267	Calderon	Ian Charles	115	llrxaJMn6L0	856	869	And so what is going on, states are taking matters into their own hands and saying, well if you're, as the FDA, not going to speed up the process, allow our patients access to these drugs, then on a state level we're going to do, we're going to do it on our own.
2268	Leno	Mark	60	5oljCvpfO9A	395	427	We invite up Carolyn Chu who's the senior fiscal and policy analyst with the LAO. Monique Ramos who is director of government affairs division at the Department of Education.  And Debbie McManus who is the director of early education and so forth division at the Department of Education along with Jessica Holmes who is an analyst with the department of finance. Welcome to you all.
2269	Gatto	Mike	46	22ufHgqGK-A	1984	1995	and some of the other paperwork is very difficult.  This will allow the Attorney General seek it in a number of different jurisdictions including where the crimes were committed with a victim lives et cetera I respectfully ask for you aye vote.
2270	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	aagt3kLsyTc	459	504	The battles that we are continuing to have to get these kinds of measures passed when we know that the ultimate benefit to the family, to the state, to the taxpayer is unquestioned. As to how measures like this, like the paid family leave, like the various other programs, whether it's unpaid family leave or paid family leave, which is paid for 100% by the employee, not a dime by the employer. Is such a rough road every time we try to bring these bills, and I know you have worked tenaciously and unwaveringly to bring this measure before us today.
2271	Leno	Mark	60	4PUbEmkSLAQ	156	175	Welcome everybody, we're pleased that you've given us your day. Doctor, we're happy start with you. And, before you do why don't we call the roll and maybe that will encourage other members who are in the building to join us.
2272	Berryhill	Tom	54	GIcgVGMKBjg	1214	1238	Thank you, Madame President. I'm rising in opposition of this second bill package. These bills have both good news and bad news in them, members. While there is some relief in 91 for certain areas or central valley towns, that's a really good thing.
2273	Allen	Travis	43	jAVMxyN_c9U	1012	1032	Now, I might have and be a financial adviser and have a degree in economics, but I don't think you need any of that to understand that electricity is dramatically more expensive in California. And this is a regressive cost, which means that this is impacting those that make less money, more than everyone else.
2274	Mitchell	Holly	64	LCBofa05MII	1936	1952	I think today's discussion reflects the broader movement of foot that calls them to question the value of the Grand Jury process across that board, and they are numerous articles that have been published by members of both the bench and bar.
2275	Hertzberg	Robert	99	wHx-nZg7Thw	1030	1041	If it does get signed by the Governor, he'll sign it, the latest, is presumably in October. That gives the Board nine months to come up with some decision instead of, you know, fifteen months to come up with a decision.
2276	Holden	Chris	78	nGcU-tnoqVY	1511	1532	Who are being put in positions where their livelihood is being snatched from under them. For whatever the reason. And that's not to paint with a broad brush and say that everything franchisor is a bad operator. But we do know and have seen and there has been a federal case to call upon this issue.
2277	Thurmond	Tony	4	oRmeSyrF0cc	199	218	What this bill would do, would essentially put the major league baseball organization in line with what's happening in other baseball throughout this nation, as you know, chewing tobacco and smokeless tobacco is banned currently in minor league baseball since 1993, at both in the minor leagues and at the college-level.
2278	Nielsen	Jim	68	PFn_-ARbOZU	58	78	We have got to be mindful of that. And if we're even going to deal with the children, there's got to be some consideration of qualification. That they at least be enrolled in school, that we give them civic opportunities to understand what naturalization is about so that they then aspire to become citizens.
2279	Bonta	Rob	85	mXX7qM53na4	543	567	I see Assembly Member Gatto here, and with my deep apologies to Assembly Member Eggman, we're doing the bills in file order. No one else can jump in front of you after Mr. Gatto goes. So we're gonna go with Assembly Member Gatto, and then Assembly Member Eggman, and then I know there are a lot of members of the public here for AB 366. We'll follow Assembly Member Eggman with a presentation of AB 366.
2280	Monning	Bill	25	Y13vuRnCz5Y	1696	1713	I will say that within the communities of opposition none are monolithic. Among physicians there are supporters and opponents. Within the disabled community there supporters and opponents. Within the religious community there supporters and opponents.
2281	McGuire	Mike	93	R2W5ElFvow0	68	87	And while Northern California, which I represent, 40% of the Californian coastline is known for its majestic redwoods and rocky shores. Southern California has the iconic palm trees and warm sandy beaches. The coast is part of our state's identity, and we've spend billions of dollars to protect its natural resources.
2282	Hertzberg	Robert	99	TrPgAQvjTc0	1217	1235	I think the opportunity is extraordinary. I think some of the belly aching that's going on around California about some of the problems are in fact opportunity. So just suggest that yes these arguments have existed, but I really believe for someone who's been all around the place and studied this stuff, it's matured dramatically.
2283	Bloom	Richard	2	mgHzB-qdttI	1622	1641	Mr. Bloom? I'm gonna be supporting the the bill today. For many of the reasons that, assembly member would identify. But I'm going to keep a close eye on it and invite advocates to continue meeting with me and reserve judgment for, for, for my vote on, on the floor.
2284	Mitchell	Holly	64	FHGwb8kBog8	269	285	And then as you know, going through the budget project, process, we will arbitrarily cut your FTE by X because you get LAO's advice, Budget staff's advice, and then we don't know the impact that will ultimately have on the success of the effort.
2285	Bonilla	Susan	3	ZDCiwfvu_KE	1130	1139	What this bill seeks to do is make sure that every school district, and I believe this is our role at the state level, Is to stay there is a uniform practice, there's a uniform standard.
2286	Wolk	Lois	94	xG-KiREcweY	2013	2041	Alright. That is approved two to one. Now we'll move to items three, five, and seven. Alright, yes, three, five, and seven. Three has to do with the Exide Enforcement Order. Five is to reject the hazardous waste reduction funding position and trailer bill language and the belief that this is a policy bill, should be vetted through the policy committees, and
2287	Mitchell	Holly	64	H1s_v6dAj4A	1758	1780	You may not have been here when the first panel spoke. We were told about the example of Great Britain. And in 1999, Great Britain made the decision they were going to reduce child poverty. And they referenced three or four policy positions, but didn't go in depth. And I'm not sure if increasing the minimum wage was a part of that. Are you familiar with their ten year effort?
2288	Bloom	Richard	2	HsL2PuGY_BI	298	323	This is an ongoing emergency, and we need to address it whenever and wherever we can on an ongoing basis. So you can anticipate that this Committee, as we proceed with the budget that's due in June, will again be addressing this issue, and we will come back as needed in future budgets to do the kinds of things that we're doing today.
2289	Melendez	Melissa	41	vYqU_TjNJ4I	12	32	Thank you. Good afternoon, Mister Chairman, and members of the committee. As we ask the citizens of this great state to do their part in water conversation, it is our responsibility to make sure the government is providing every tool and incentive possible to make a severe and difficult change a little more bearable.
2290	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	DPeb4bLxnpo	2187	2198	At the same time, we know in some agricultural communities, they're taking a major hit, too, but some people aren't, or some groups aren't. So, how do we explain that to people, or how do we justify that?
2291	Leno	Mark	60	2QITrr6350o	1584	1597	Could I just ask the California Apartment Association to clarify for us where you get your certainty. And see if there's anything to change, I don't think there is.
2292	Wieckowski	Bob	55	670ewxdSqNM	106	116	Is the inelgibility on the first, the first group of people, you get a, you get transfer credits or you had to teach out, or what happens if that's not complete, you know?
2293	Bigelow	Frank	91	aMmnutMx8lk	1121	1136	Although current law says local agencies can impose fees until a groundwater sustainable plan is adopted, this amendment will provide that authority, when terminated upon adoption of a groundwater management sustainability plan.
2294	Rodriguez	Freddie	69	C3fC_QKuL0U	1724	1738	I run those calls with them at two in the morning or ten in the morning, whatever the case may be. I see what goes on and what we all deal with. Times have changed. What we're facing now isn't what I faced when I started in 1984 in the ambulance industry.
2295	Levine	Marc	8	Hvyw9CxPJq8	501	518	And I don't understand why you would do this outside the collective bargaining system, and of course that it doesn't help us with the longer term bigger picture goal of creating full time faculty that have the ability to spend their time with their students the way that they really deserve.
2296	Stone	Jeff	26	rrDz5IDQFPY	1633	1652	And certainly it's kind of an aberration that you have one county out of an entire state that takes care of a particular service that the state has beem kind of been charged with. But, even if we didn't renew the contract with LA county there's just no way we'd have the capability of managing the caseloads that exist there.
2297	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	FMt4j4ajPsQ	847	856	The, the problem we have today, why we're having this conversation, is this was agreed to previously. Now today, we learn that it wasn't agreed to. That's why we're having this discussion right now.
2298	Hill	Jerry	66	y0NCxRtyQHE	98	108	I think that would be how it would be done and that should be identified by the provider or by your reviews which courses would be approved and those that would not be.
2299	Gray	Adam	27	oXNKeIzrJ6c	937	968	And in a time where this state, and frankly this country, has continued to fight to make sure that every constituent, every citizen has access to healthcare, the lack of medical infrastructure, with an insurance card, doesn't help a whole lot, because you've gotta have those physicians in the community. And studies have shown the best way to increase physician access, or one of the best ways, is to put medical education into an underserved community.
2300	Pavley	Fran	104	HU5u3bnal2k	1753	1785	drop-off the numbers students enrolled in teacher credential programs by 74% over the last 10 to 12 years for a variety of reason. The high cost of education coupled with the student loan debt, the recession caused some job insecurity among younger teachers. We've eliminated all teacher recruitment and financial aid programs. And one-third of California is teachers are currently 50 years old or older. They will
2301	Chavez	Rocky	83	sG4OVCyYfwo	811	826	I'm sorry I've had to run in and out, I've been doing committee meetings. But quickly on your 56 when you said, page 56, figure 28, capital outlays related to student growth, I scanned this. In your opinion which one's student growth?
2302	Frazier	Jim	114	kQ8roglP29M	1959	1980	I really do have to commend my staff and your staff working together to really get this down to nuts and bolts of what's going on. I realized the local licensing issue was problematic, and I think it would be worthwhile to look at something like this on a statewide basis, and I'm happy to help work with all parties to make that happen.
2303	Hancock	Loni	98	12bt77nSPXs	1058	1089	That's right. It would just maybe make it a little less likely. Okay, this is an oversight item, I have no other questions. But I'm amazed that when we're getting all these requests for more money and more staff and more everything. It doesn't occur to us that maybe a simple procedure that is used already in other parts of the system would not be appropriate here.
2304	Chiu	David	7	wK5CwGDTeOM	56	73	All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote. The clerk will close the roll and tall the votes. Aye's - 42, no's - 25, the measure passes.
2305	Dahle	Brian	47	lKgPPhMwBGU	1022	1030	But, that's the one area that I have a really tough time with, it's the takings, in my mind it is. Is there any room for negotiation on that?
2306	McGuire	Mike	93	qbDN-8u61LI	1823	1836	And what I would hope is the bill you see coming to your committee would be either a package of complementary bills, one bill. But, we're all working together, and you have my commitment, sir. Thank you.
2307	Quirk	Bill	23	UdyJhNk-vh8	463	481	Well, so this is a recent amendment as requested. And certainly for a police chief, it's very clear that the governing body appoints and such. You're right. There is a different with the sheriff, and I will certainly try to see what we can work out there. The other question is
2308	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	P6cBeme--dw	782	796	I've heard, you know, everything's fine in Oregon. Well first of all, I have studied this bill probably more than any that I've seen. We cannot definitively say everything's fine in Oregon. There's just not a whole lot of data.
2309	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	P6cBeme--dw	796	814	But I do know this, there aren't a lot of communities like mine in Oregon. It's a different world. This is a serious issue. It's tough. I don't want to urge people to vote yes or no. It's very personal, but I think it's the type of decision that voters should have the right to.
2310	Mitchell	Holly	64	4YUeKJp9AQ0	1314	1353	We are providing guidance, as requested by the code enforcement officers. To begin the process of acknowledging the fact that there is some mold that is not tenant generated. That is harmful, and that we want the home owners, recognize that the vast majority of home owners want to maintain the integrity of their property. As you and I certainly do and would.
2311	Beall	Jim	92	pr4Lpt1U5o4	375	397	This appointment's the Governor executive subject to the approval of the Senate. So I think that this will be one way of increasing the efficiency of our expenditures and our system of building and providing transportation needs for the State of California. That's why I support the bill, Senator, and thank you for introducing it.
2312	Williams	Das	12	jPqrvLMy3Rw	862	879	We'll just go down the file order because I think otherwise it will be far too confusing with forty-something bills. So let's start with AB 21, Item 1 by Mr. Perea.
2313	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	47vy5JeX0sg	281	310	The secretary observes we have a quorum. Would the members and our guests beyond the rail in the gallery please rise. We will be led in prayer this afternoon by our chaplain sister Michelle Gorman, after which please remain standing we will be lead in the pledge of allegiance to the flag by Senator McGuire.
2314	Quirk	Bill	23	nJsCwYpjBcE	1343	1361	I think that is a better mechanism than the hate crime mechanism. Remember for the hate crime that is a question not so much of hate as is bias. You can hate a particular officer and kill them. The question is do you hate all officers.
2315	Leno	Mark	60	_ES7C4KFvkc	1362	1395	That would be helpful. Thank you. Page ten is home to school transportation. All right. LAO sorry. We are approaching 1 o'clock and as forewarned we're going to have to attend to some floor and caucus business, so if it's agreeable with everyone else's schedule, we can be back here at 2 o'clock sharp.
2316	Stone	Jeff	26	vPceAWe-pfQ	1531	1559	I still have concerns of CSAC and the league. I understand their concerns, I hope the author will continue to work with them. Because the last thing I'd ever want is us to support a policy like this that would stifle, if you will a municipality, a sheriff, a police chief from hiring people because of the fear of you know, in a lot of litigation, which we're talking about 3,000 people.
2317	Waldron	Marie	29	gdqTdEZLl0I	1878	1890	Because it seems to me just hearing of this it's such a critical issue of someone's life that, you know, having this there is so much better than just having no option at all.
2318	Wolk	Lois	94	uk0vIxtVZmg	349	362	And consolidation of communities, in my district and others, that do not have adequate drinking water, and if they do have some drinking water, it's not necessarily of a good quality.
2319	Block	Marty	59	icpOpHkAqBE	399	424	SB 337 would allow a physician to consign a minimum of 20% of schedule II prescriptions, if the physician assistant completes a controlled substances course. The supervising physician may require a higher percentage of co-signatures on Schedule II medications, in the delegation services agreement. Again, this is at the call of the supervising physician.
2320	Wagner	Donald	88	9mjyTPfbhPw	268	289	on the ballot where we can't very easily take that next and the following and the following steps. Best case scenario vote this down, and that ballot measure does not pass because we must fight for life.
2321	Campos	Nora	76	iDZCoA28Gzg	1106	1117	First of all, I want to thank Senator Wolk for the work she's done in the past and for the question and I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
2322	Hancock	Loni	98	WsNNww2cgqU	1819	1835	Well let me suggest this is a policy committee. It is interesting the bill was not referred to appropriations. Must have thought it would be a minimal cost and that a process would be developed.
2323	Thurmond	Tony	4	VixXoFAwUIs	1348	1358	Nobody can afford to live on $16,000 a year. Which is what a minimum wage job pays at 40 hours a week. So I think this is right sizing a situation that has needed to be changed for a long-time.
2324	Fuller	Jean	49	hp2WTRF5hkg	1612	1637	And, and I lean a little bit toward the chair's amendments because if you, if you slow it down a little bit, it's, it's more likely to not have damage if you're not able to do that. But overall, this is a, this is a very big leap. And I appreciate your thoughtful initial design.
2325	Hertzberg	Robert	99	VHKwUGu3F0g	955	975	And I also think just to further, which I think's critically important for the legislative branch of government, Madame Leader, is to also have both houses. Maybe in joint hearings, do that. And try to establish some priorities rather than create unnecessary tensions and really enhance the importance of this branch of government. With that, one more question and we'll have you close.
2326	Monning	Bill	25	oC8-KbPE6Yo	1424	1443	SB 344 will prepare California's implementation on the most basic component of these regulations, and we should not take the stance of waiting on the federal government To act to pass the bill, especially when it has been more than 20 years since congress initial law to require the training.
2327	Wolk	Lois	94	1fof-e9skdQ	1046	1063	Let me see very quickly. Increase-- We might be able to increase the number of school nurses particularly in California's most needy school districts as well as provide for some of these other services that are provided to students. Again, federal funding, let's draw it down and let's do good things for those kids.
2328	Beall	Jim	92	ckv1hzYbS0w	1316	1346	Thank you very much Brian and we'll a few questions now. I'd like to ask, maybe the three of you, in terms of looking at, ahead, when we're talking about the Governor's plan for some strategic goals to 2039 and beyond, looking at the way we accomplish that, you have to look at cost-effectiveness.
2329	Grove	Shannon	77	maPB0VHfdFQ	1104	1121	Thank you, Mr. Speaker. In my view, these bills symbolize a broken budget process. When you cast your vote for these bills today, you'll be voting for the unknown. When you have no idea what the final bills, well the language in this final bill will be the outcome, you have no idea what that will be.
2330	Gatto	Mike	46	kAZMIWno7zI	495	506	People have seen that it seems to be it's not just a matter of if out there; it really is a matter of when. So many big companies have been targeted by hackers and data feeds.
2331	Pan	Richard	96	iDZCoA28Gzg	461	485	Yes, I guess in terms of the CCI, the California Applicants for Nursing Home reform brought, the terms. And I think one of the things I'm struggling with is that clearly the situation here now, you transition into a better place, but that place also is not one of great stability or certainty.
2332	Brown	Cheryl	13	gDPCmEU7pmg	1548	1571	During this historic drought, this is really a modest measure. However, 80% of much of the water we use is the water grass, we can't eat. In one of my communities, there were people who were not watering their grass and they were fined.
2333	Brown	Cheryl	13	I6IkPPhOVjM	264	284	That's about $11 million a day or about $4 billion a year. I want to start with a quote from my favorite author, John C Maxwell. He said "leadership is a matter of attitude and it is contagious."
2334	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	HgBIr1hupMw	784	797	I think the essence of what she was observing is that if you take just a... your average teacher, and you put into a classroom above average students, the teacher becomes an above average teacher.
2335	Weber	Shirley	44	1dDkNt95rgU	626	638	We're constantly working to make sure that the agencies that believe they're gonna lose services will continue those services that are there. Change is always difficult, we know that even when it's sometimes to improve services.
2336	Hancock	Loni	98	nqnHx0FnCOc	235	267	really believe that given the other unmet needs in the state, there has to be a way to work with that. And let me just say that as part of the blueprint that was adopted in 2012, the department and the administration said that they would end all out-of-state contracts by this year 2015-16. And that we would save, therefore,
2337	Irwin	Jacqui	16	pyW7Y47fazc	98	112	Our conversation here is not academic. It is in preparation for the future. Our goal is to learn about the structure for oversight of the for-profit private colleges. Why veteran students are such an important part of the discussion.
2338	Brown	Cheryl	13	bXJhxM-W13s	442	475	I think Janet Napolitano and Mr. Tim White would say that they don't think that that's true, but we'll move on. The other thing I wanted to ask you is you want to... you talked about building relationships with this accelerator grant. You want to build relationships with community-based organizations and churches and those kind of groups. How are you going to help them fund that?
2339	Nielsen	Jim	68	FUkZtNfL8Qo	1255	1286	I have very personally been impacted by it. We see lost productivity and we see great frustrations of our farm, of, of our constituents. Now, the, this provision here allows for what is a queue callback. In other words, you can opt, while you're waiting, to kick off the line, go about your business. And that would then trigger that someone, I'm certain, would be getting back to you.
2340	Moorlach	John	4657	9_Ipr5dyo2o	1261	1291	to establish successor agencies and deal with acronyms like ROPS for Recognized Obligation Payment Schedules and, you know, that created a hornets nest and it also created some pretty bitter relationships between cities in Sacramento and counties in Sacramento. So, now this bill showed up today.
2341	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	quIuv9zWSqs	603	626	Thank you, Catherine. If we can bring up the first panel now, and as they come up. We have Victoria Hassid, the Deputy Director of the Legislation Policy of the Department of Industrial Relations, to start. We're also gonna have Winnie Cowell, Trang Trion, and Tu Fam, and this is dealing with labor practices that affect salon workers.
2342	Frazier	Jim	114	9CBpVwqHDr0	59	88	So we have a quorum. So I'd like to make some announcements and measures that are on the consent calendar. File Item Number Six A.B. 218 Melendez. File Item Number Nine A.B. 270. File Item Number 11 A.C.R. 1. File Item 12 A.C.R. 8. File Item 14 A.C.R. 16 and File Item 15 A.C.R. 21. Those are on consent.
2343	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	JwS_raJ5ApY	414	434	Here it is our responsibility in this committee to honor and protect the constitution and its rights and its responsibilities. So that's where we are today. And with that I'd like to invite Senators Pan and Allen to step forward so that we will start as a subcommittee.
2344	Thurmond	Tony	4	9-tqw489jZ4	1440	1456	that I chair. I can't tell you the countless number of testimonials we heard from low-income Californians who are trying their hardest to work their way out of poverty. Many of them working minimum wage jobs where they have to work two jobs to make $30,000 a year.
2345	Hernandez	Ed	103	omT12LxK-8I	1637	1662	Thank you.  Anyone else support? Opposition? Questions, comments? Questions or comments from any of the members? And there's no comments. There was a motion by Senator Pan. Chairs recommend support. How would you like to close?
2346	McGuire	Mike	93	f0azg54_KEY	1070	1081	The question I have is on the third point on the amendments that are being brought forward: authorize the local government to restrict or prohibit the serving of alcohol in the salon or barber establishment.
2347	Thurmond	Tony	4	QvpErJVY-kU	1118	1131	Thank you, Mr. Doyle. Just so you know, on that last point, some on the Committee have a slightly different view on that last point about IHSS. We will be taking that up at another time. Thank you.
2348	Rendon	Anthony	120	yegxkcxS3po	523	537	The growing population of Los Angeles County, decreasing ground water supplies, and sea water intrusion meant the creation of the West Basin Water District, to also acquire imported water.
2349	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	yhx1NvxzAgA	848	866	We have jurisdictional requirements in order to make that system of justice work as best as we can. And so, that is all sort of a prefatory remark to say that I believe that in the amendments that I recommended here, acknowledge some of the very
2350	Monning	Bill	25	81AHHgExKGE	139	154	What we are seeking with SB 260, is the ability for a patient to get very clear consumer assistance services, like the independent medical review, or IMR the HMO help line and external review.
2351	Huff	Bob	105	6Q9j6EYWwEw	562	575	There's even been called the worst turn out here in 72 years. Technical amendments are made in the Assembly, co-authors are added. SCR 42 has had bipartisan support from both houses to date, received no no votes. I ask for your aye vote.
2352	Liu	Carol	63	h0Gkdxuepz8	50	70	institutions are offering the students but also how we, as a body, can facilitate the realization of their educational goals. Lastly, it's important to note that the US Department of Education was invited to participate in the hearing, but unfortunately, they did not respond to our request.
2353	Allen	Benjamin	70	UOAgtw9idpM	855	869	that excited about this broader trend of avoiding National Park Service with regards the national monuments that are created and I wanted to get a sense from the panelists about this, and your reaction to that thought.
2354	Quirk	Bill	23	DgVvXUz7n-U	1405	1428	Thank you Speaker and members. I stand in strong support of this bill. I have had several relatives with terminal diagnoses. I had a sister who was told that she had six months to live. She decided to go in for all the chemotherapy, have a great year.
2355	De Leon	Kevin	102	YGvsvPIzjxQ	756	776	That's a thought that we can definitely look into. Obviously, we just moved last year, Senator Jackson and myself. The first Yes Means Yes Affirmative Consent measure of it's kind in the nation. We decided to go incrementally into high school, but I think we're very open to that, and perhaps we may end up working together if we go into the middle school level.
2356	Mitchell	Holly	64	yp3pHtPtFfM	389	405	Have we now have we moved from the basement to the first-floor or just up a couple rungs in the staircase. It occurs to me that we don't have that same kind of measure, to give us a sense of the impact of the disinvestment in many of the health and human services areas.
2357	Bonta	Rob	85	iq_O5tryJ2s	998	1039	I agree. Thank you Miss Howel and Miss Iacino, we heard that you used to have an internal time frame and then you no longer have it. Do you have a philosophical objection to a time frame or are you in a assess mode where you're trying to figure out what the new time frame would be? You can here from the members up here, we're really interested in a time frame. We have a bill this year that includes a time frame. 40 days, Ms. Brown is carrying that bill, Chair Brown. Do you have any input on that? A lot of the members up here think in the absence of some action on your part, we need to step into that gap and act. So what is your view of 40 day time frame and time frames in general?
2358	Mullin	Kevin	31	dKlfu24NXRk	1367	1377	With me today, I have Rebecca Long of the MTC along with Denis Mulligan of the Golden Gate Bridge Highway and Transportation District to answer any technical questions. Thanks for having me.
2359	Wagner	Donald	88	bzJzCS8XdVc	1900	1920	Who have, to use his phrase, and the one we all use, made the ultimate sacrifice. Those aren't the subject of this bill. So while we can talk about them and show respect for them and recognize that perhaps folks in those circumstances. Not perhaps in my mind.
2360	Hernandez	Ed	103	h1jaLifdzdM	1449	1469	So, seeing no members, let's go back through the list until we see some members. So I'm gonna start off with the consent calendar. Can I ask the public if we can please allow us to continue the work? So we're gonna do consent calendar again, item number one, three, seven, 13 and 16, if you can call the absent members please.
2361	Kim	Young	82	YGvsvPIzjxQ	2237	2258	Having let the testing services contract expire, this legislation calls for convening an advisory can also provide recommendations on the continuation of the CAHSEE, and on the alternative pathways to satisfy the high school graduation requirement. My thought is, why couldn't we do it at the same time?
2362	Atkins	Toni	110	r1PhXBRe6ug	578	618	Let us question ourselves every moment we have a thought that seems to be somewhat negative in terms of people's actions, actions come from pain and from hurt and from fear. We have to take those feelings and move beyond it. As I sat here and listened to all of you speak I am grateful, I am thankful, and I hope that I can take a kernel of what I just heard and in one of those moments where I have a feeling of wanting to go in the opposite direction remember what a courageous person did in those moments.
2363	Maienschein	Brian	84	ZZs409-zmok	605	633	Motion from Mr. Alejo, second from Mr. Linder. And for the record that motion would be, thank you for accepting the amendments it's a due pass as amended to accept the technical amendments listed in comment seven of the analysis. And to clarify in the bills provisions that more than one inspection may be required pursuant to the recommendations of the OPR guide book. Okay, we have a motion and a second, ask the clerk to please call the roll. You may close gentlemen.
2364	De Leon	Kevin	102	-c-ApA12-MU	52	66	They are multi-cultural, all-female, infused with the true flavor of Southern California, and for that matter throughout the state of California, of the ethnic melting pot which gave their birth and their unique sound back in 1999.
2365	Leno	Mark	60	Jy18DQ2_OCI	1689	1710	Sure. Thank you. So we do have a motion by Assemblywoman Weber. We'll take the vote in just a moment, but out of respect for the work that the administration has put into this I don't know that we want to pull out Section 12439 on its own. I don't know if there are any unintended consequences of just doing that and not doing anything else at this time.
2366	Cannella	Anthony	61	fdbxd6pnPrg	1063	1079	So, since they come to you and you make the decision of whether they can be released early, do you have much interaction with DJJ, and say, look, you guys need to do better in this area, or this is what I'm looking for. The kids I'm seeing are deficient. I mean, how interactive is the relationship?
2367	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	eiRf682j8LU	857	870	That's what you need, and that's what you get when you do these type of programs. You bring that sense of pride, and wanting to learn more, not only about your history, but other people's histories, when you have ethnic studies.
2368	Olsen	Kristin	15	d_EaaILk1VE	216	228	It's really not a partisan issue and as Republicans and Democrats, I think we would do a great job working together to increase trust in government by simply allowing bills to be in print for at least 72 hours.
2369	Weber	Shirley	44	0LdXFnPqPCk	995	1022	When we think about this march, the Bloody Sunday, I'm reminded not just of bloody Sunday, but I'm reminded of the red summer of 1919 where Africa where there was so much bloodshed in this country after African-Americans came back from fighting in World War I and have the audacity to wear their uniform in this country and to be shot and killed in uniform for once again asserting themselves just to be treated as Americans.
2370	Garcia	Cristina	112	95pquWUVfBw	726	740	And I've seen the other sides I have to say been invited by some of these providers in my district to say were not all the same it's a spectrum here and so I think this bill allows you to continue to be the provider that you want to be while sharing some information out there.
2371	Pan	Richard	96	OACKM5KF8Sk	16	37	We'll ask the Department. And then actually you did mention that there was that, in the recommendations, there was one recommendation that the Department did not agree with. I do have it here, if I can read it here, or I can ask you which, what it is but. So, well I'll just read it since I have in front of me.
2372	Beall	Jim	92	hb1VvxrKGQE	1217	1228	Oh okay it's a commitment to the amendment in public safety. Okay, the deal with the issues raised in the staff report. You're amending it in Public Safety, not in this committee.
2373	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	jSYoUQmoG0c	22	34	Thank you Mr. Chair and the rest of the Housing and Community Development Committee. Thank for you considering AB 396 today. I want to thank the committee consultant for a thorough analysis of the bill.
2374	Hall	Isadore	1	f0azg54_KEY	516	535	Okay, and thank you for working with the committee. And with the amendments that would allow for significant oversight in this piece of legislation, so thank you for your willingness Mr. Daly, to work with the committee on that.
2375	Alejo	Luis	9	NNzDQCiG5UU	534	555	Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, on behalf of my colleagues in the Latino Legislative Caucus, it is a great honor to also congratulate Ambassador Carlos Gonzales Gutierrez on his assignment in Austin, Texas. In 2009, Mr. Gonzalez Gutierrez was appointed by the President of Mexico to serve as the consul general of Mexico in Sacramento.
2376	Chiu	David	7	NlzNfy_j0A8	181	193	I just want to also echo our colleague, Mr. Bonta's comments on this and really note the LOA's observation that again, the proposed schedules for these closures are faster than other closures.
2377	Wagner	Donald	88	_b18tzFsHIo	975	1007	We're not excluding anyone from this education, we are allowing parents, we are allowing parents to direct their education, and I'm sorry, I can't let it go unchallenged to say that it's the equivalent of me directing my child's education is the same thing as the Federal government throwing our good friend from the last session as your modest parents in an internment camp.
2378	Liu	Carol	63	YGvsvPIzjxQ	1326	1354	The bill establishes a work group to provide recommendations back to the Superintendent of Public Instruction for further action. The Human Resources Research Organization 2014 Biannual Report states that California high school exit exam has served a valuable purpose by ensuring students demonstrate competency on standards providing, remediation opportunities prior to grade 12.
2379	Pavley	Fran	104	GUxOzh3Wh0Q	1979	1996	With your amendments Chair, I will support this today, but when the environmental quality committee comes up I'd like to reserve the right to push even harder on making sure the co-benefits.
2380	Allen	Benjamin	70	vwnSyW8C-l8	1625	1633	I rise in support of this bill, but I do want to make some comments about the extent to which we still are dramatically under funding public higher education in the state.
2381	McGuire	Mike	93	LuelkxPlWfo	80	106	Visiting local small businesses and neighborhoods in cities that they wouldn't otherwise visit. And, I couldn't agree more with this statement, and this statement may sound familiar, as it is the statement and the message that Airbnb sent to members of this committee. When I was a member of the Sonoma County Board of Supervisors, we worked to create a system that actually increased the number of vacation rentals in our region.
2382	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	519YUTER2IM	31	48	Well thank you Mr. Chair and members, my apologies. And I appreciate your indulgence. As you know, it's hard to be in so many places at once, but I'm glad to be here and to present SB 180.
2383	Alejo	Luis	9	DEi_8R7XWOE	194	211	It is my commitment to work with all the stakeholders, this committee, and the administration, to figure out the best approach of having Groundwater Sustainability Act and the groundwater adjudications work together so that we can have an adequate and sustainable water supply for years to come. With that I respectfully ask for aye vote and I have several advocates to speak in support of the bill, Mr. Chairman.
2384	Stone	Jeff	26	2MXVIex_Zeg	2243	2253	There needs to be some defensible formula to protect the state certainly from litigation but more importantly, to make sure that there's a consistent policy throughout the state in helping these young children, so.
2385	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	L_nqL1xdfS8	665	687	Right. And I know that was the purpose of the spill. I have no objection with them just actually following the train of thought that we make assumptions that this peer review is working. And I'm just wondering whether there's anything, any data that demonstrates that, and apparently we don't have that in the state for pharmacist or these other entities. Just a question, perhaps, something we might look at.
2386	Chau	Ed	116	UdyJhNk-vh8	2034	2044	So it currently doesn't have that, anymore. So. Yeah, we do accept the technical amendments suggested by the committee by the way. So with that done, I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
2387	Fuller	Jean	49	GhElfEb6QxY	325	340	The question, and it can be to either or both of you okay. How prevalent is the use of underground regulations, and what could be done to address the problem?
2388	Atkins	Toni	110	4MjmF7EnXtg	17	31	Thank you, Madam Chair and Senators. It's my pleasure to also present today Assembly Bill 392, which would enable the San Diego River Conservancy to take its place as one of our state's permanent conservancies.
2389	De Leon	Kevin	102	rEreViIPqP0	749	798	I think we need some women in here also too we're just going to mention because we have that share the Women's Caucus who is presiding here today and also accompanying them from the Independent Energy Producers Association is Mr. Jan Smutney Jones as well as from the California Independent System Operator Mary McDonnell and Hugo Frech. Colleagues, please extend a very warm welcome to our friends from Chile to the California State Senate.
2390	Obernolte	Jay	86	yJyUjyu8c_M	886	906	But other kinds of efficiency, while laudable, would actually hurt you. So for example, increased air conditioning efficiency would make things worse for you. Increased refrigeration efficiency wouldn't hurt you or help you, wouldn't help at all, in fact. So can you talk a bit more about that, what you mean by increased efficiency and why it helps?
2391	Mitchell	Holly	64	Mt9BcU600uM	659	676	And so what responsibility should the state have in funding it? I think that's been the issue in terms of the teachers contributing to their fund versus what the state has to put into the fund. It's been an ongoing conversation since we don't employ teachers. What's our role? What's our role? That's what I am interested in your opinion.
2392	Stone	Jeff	26	c3rIX9MpSXI	996	1006	I just throw that out as a suggestion to, you know a place where people probably regularly go. It would be nice if we could make it more convenient for them.  Throughout the state of California.
2393	Chu	Kansen	32	yAgUQvRrkrQ	1339	1359	And my heart and prayer definitely go to his family, his loved ones, his friends, and all his colleagues, his brothers and sisters, and San Jose PD. As well as many of those lives that got cut short due to the violence on the street. Thank you.
2394	Kim	Young	82	DFwwvEWhxJg	1080	1096	I mean there was a reason why it was called the hidden tax. But, so, would you agree to, quick question, many have also expected that the price will go up to like seventy five cents per gallon. Is that high?
2395	Chiu	David	7	7KrRcZ9ORsY	1700	1717	And really what we are doing with this law, it's a very narrowly tailored policy to address the compelling government interest of ensuring that all pregnant women are notified about their full spectrum of health care options without referring to specific abortion clinics, without suggesting that one clinic is better than another.
2396	Hernandez	Ed	103	6rfjyYYx2nU	54	65	I don't know if we can legislatively make that amendment. It may have to be done back through the vote of the people, which, we're gonna verify that. But at this point, it's not that we're opposed, but keep in mind this was an initiative that was passed.
2397	McCarty	Kevin	22	gjsHvnVIeLU	1237	1260	States like New Jersey, Oklahoma, Florida, California unfortunately is behind. And so this provides us with the opportunity to make sure that all of our youngest learners have the opportunity to go to pre-school and enter kindergarten ready to succeed. With me today are advocates from Early Edge California and the LA Chamber of Commerce willing to testify. I respectfully ask for your aye vote. Thank you.
2398	Rendon	Anthony	120	OGSzGIXfLs8	113	130	It starts with the Commission itself, which pays for its operations by collecting fees from the public utilities that it regulates. Last week's May revised provided for $1.6 billion in cost for PUC operations. Which includes a wide range of activities and programs for utilities and rate payers.
2399	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	2QITrr6350o	366	381	Thank you very much. Are there any other witnesses in support? Are there any witnesses in opposition? I just have a question as a practical matter. This, did you want to ask a question?  Well thank you.
2400	Harper	Matthew	14	4sq_B6zlasQ	295	312	Instead we're making yet another cram down of how locals are supposed to run their elections. Local should be able to make decisions and how to run their elections. Simply ask them rather than cramming it down.
2401	Thurmond	Tony	4	y-mPYI-CNoc	1761	1781	If, I'm happy to hear more about, I would ask you to  speak to Ms. McGraw from my office if you have other concerns but I want to make sure we get all the speakers in.
2402	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	bB6-EJZQbO8	787	805	As we honor single parents today, I would like to remind us as we go forward this year in particular the Legislative Women's Caucus is going to try to address some of those additional challenges of unequal pay and low wages and high childcare costs and the challenges that exist just in running a family and working and caring for children and loving them and raising them to be good wholesome contributing members of society.
2403	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	bB6-EJZQbO8	805	854	It is a great challenge. Their efforts are to be comended and to be honored and indeed today in recognition of this day of, the Legislative Women's Caucus and the Senate Pro Tem, Kevin De Leon, would like to honor all single parents working in the capital, whether on this floor or those who keep us to make us look good day-in-and-day-out for their all their hard work devotion and sacrifices to join us us over in the Chickoree immediately upon adournment for a little celebration and thanks for the great work they do on behalf of all of us here in the state. With that, I would ask for your aye vote.
2404	Nielsen	Jim	68	oZrbKv34-B8	911	924	Folks, I do wanna compliment the authors for the tremendous amount of effort in the bill. And it's been a hard thing to get me to yes on this legislation.
2405	Pan	Richard	96	4mB1nCFXohc	1833	1848	And, so that's the problem I'm still frustrated with. I'm not sure there's an answer, but at least let's try to be fair to those people and those boards that they're not bearing even additional costs for failures in the system.
2406	Mathis	Devon	75	3Luw7tOrBzg	1140	1153	And if you can't be accredited across the board on that, or this is the basic format of a paragraph, or this is how you write a sentence, then we have some severe issues.
2407	Beall	Jim	92	sCQOMUPHoy8	406	420	it's a pretty big one and California is the third largest transportation fuel market in the world which means that California's market is larger than any country except for the United States and China
2408	Pan	Richard	96	4mB1nCFXohc	1848	1862	So I actually think that if we are actually doing the due diligence that we were supposed to do the first time then certainly for release three, I'm sure that you do have to do some of the work that was described.
2409	Bonta	Rob	85	dGJ3Wrr59rg	130	163	After the informational hearings, the committee will be ready to hold bill hearings to consider special session legislation. The special session is an opportunity for the legislature and governor to address some important issues that we could not resolve in this year's budget. In particular, the possibility of rate increases for providers of MediCal and developmental disability services. Critical to our work is the reauthorization of the Managed Care Organization Tax, or the MCO Tax. The MCO Tax is an important existing source of funding for the MediCal program.
2410	Wilk	Scott	19	VpwREaswL_E	846	861	This change to the Bagley-Keene act would be the same stamina that is currently in the Brown Act which governs local government. We should have the same transparency here in Sacramento as we do with our local governments and I ask for an aye vote.
2411	Leno	Mark	60	By4bB8yg798	439	446	Thank you, Mr. Taylor those were great examples. If you could share with the Committee some of the MOU issues that also come through the Joint Legislative Budget Committee.
2412	Beall	Jim	92	ogaPmR_89iU	1819	1858	Sixth bill that on call. Senator McGuire I think it's time for your three bills. Senator McGuire has item seven SB 523, and then item 10, SB 593, and then item 13, SB 747. Okay Senator, you have the floor. Would you like to start with those in order if you could,
2413	Stone	Jeff	26	h8s0v2JD3F8	1058	1070	Well, it sounds like you've tried to make it as user-friendly and small business as possible, and I applaud you, because I've always been one that has advocated the government needs to run more efficiently and use technology.
2414	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	tEhMYBdIqkE	2019	2038	the city effort, human resources, everything, to pull together. Have you, at that part of your job of what you would like to do, would you like to create in the AG's office so that we can systematically pool all our resources to tackle it, or is that something that's really huge?
2415	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	A2CxN21_Gyw	146	164	Moreover, extension of current law through this bill will also help reduce financial penalties imposed on California by the federal government for our state's accumulation of uncollected child support debt. Here today to testify is Karen Lange, legislative advocate for Placer, San Joaquin,
2416	Stone	Jeff	26	LCBofa05MII	1549	1562	First, let me call off on my questions by saying that any officer that abuses their power in any way, including the loss of an innocent civilian deserves to be fully prosecuted.
2417	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	tEhMYBdIqkE	2058	2073	And if it's something you can't answer now or to be able to get back to me, I would love to see a budget package, or something. So that, the reason for this is so that we can actually tackle the problem this year. That was the promise we made to several members of this Committee.
2418	Hueso	Ben	48	0MzTgkt-Llc	2022	2046	be required or needed. This bill simply six to extend for an additional two years the temporary authority given to the AG to represent the EOB so it can continue to do what has been doing under the existing authority namely to sign-off on financial sentiments relating to the two claims arising from the 2000-2002 energy crisis I ask for your aye vote for this important measure.
2419	Nielsen	Jim	68	xusZRk9gg60	1159	1172	There used to be provisions for the rural districts that have greater difficulties with weather and with mileage. Are there any special accommodations for those kinds of districts in the homeschooled transportation?
2420	Campos	Nora	76	i1dEPEL80sQ	1070	1082	And we break the cycles of what is happening to our boys and men of color. I have witnesses with me. We're going to start with, Kimberly Chen because she has to leave, and then we'll go down the line. Thank you.  Move the bill. Second. ...Thank you so much Thank you for the family member for bring this important measure

2423	McCarty	Kevin	22	GcMV__uVRbo	1357	1366	I get that, but it's a check.  From the State of California, and we get 1% enrollment growth.  On the nat you think we should be getting more from that.
2424	Campos	Nora	76	YNjNXr0cQTo	161	203	Thank you Assemblymember Gonzalez, I'm joined with my colleagues, and we'd like to welcome all of you to this informational hearing, I look forward to today's dialogue that will bring to light important issues with labor practice, health and safety in California's nail salons. As chair of the Select Committee on the status of girls and women of color, I am pleased to be working in partnership with Assemblymember who chairs the Assembly Select Committee on women in the work place and also with the Chair of the Assembly Committee on health, labor, business and professions.
2425	Leyva	Connie	62	h8juzK-Kjc4	879	888	So if you work twenty eight hours a week, you're going to grows two-hundred-and-fifty two dollars a week and your monthly income will be a thousand eight dollars a week.
2426	Liu	Carol	63	WpcX9flvLXg	840	857	Thank you, Madam President and members. This bill, SB 42, is back on concurrence. And this bill would establish the Office of Higher Education Performance and Accountability in the Governor's Office as a successor agency to the California Post-Secondary Education Commission. Amendments in
2427	Chu	Kansen	32	ZHlQISHQoPg	269	289	Thank you Mr. Chair. First of all, I just wanted to state, I came from a very high cost of living area. And when I was a San Jose City council member, I was very fortunate to be able to raise the minimum wage to $10, about three years ago.
2428	Hernandez	Roger	37	FZTo8zIUL5Q	135	146	This can be answered by any representative from the horse-racing industry. You talked about the percentage of your online gambling activities. Did you say that was 30% of your take?
2429	Pan	Richard	96	4mB1nCFXohc	1947	1974	So, I guess I'll just sum up by saying, I am concerned that we just put all the costs on the wave one and two boards. We're in some senses penalizing them for the past failures and I'm not interested in trying to raise prices on the wave three, but if we're actually going to be investing in an IT infrastructure that's benefiting all the boards, then it should at least be proportionately borne across all the boards.
2430	Allen	Benjamin	70	2CIDVI97Hpk	247	266	No, that's really helpful. That's really helpful. Okay, well, so I guess this is the last thing. I know we're for crunched for time a little bit, but we have been talking a lot about this reuse of produced water. And I just wanted to, the L.A. Times had a story about this issue, and I just wanted to get a sense of what level of testing is currently required.
2431	Dababneh	Matthew	50	qEEp65rUcCA	1309	1349	I just wanna thank the author. Also, he's not here today, but I thank Mr Jones for combining the efforts with you in a rare bipartisan moment. I thought his was a good bill as well. I think they're both good examples of not only making sure that we're promoting business in our own state, but promoting manufacturing where we can. But I do hope that the intent of the bill is based on the Maglite example that we've seen before. A product that's made here in our state, made in America, that had one or two small, very technical pieces that you will never know were in that flashlight, but that are not simply made in America.
2432	Bates	Pat	58	_H7zvwgU_3w	730	750	That way, I think we come up with, Senator Beall, some better legislation, better policy direction, rather than having what seem to be endless debates. And I will share information I have, and it's not new news, there's an initiative process underway to submit to the voters.
2433	Bates	Pat	58	_H7zvwgU_3w	750	777	If they vote to discontinue this, and we've given no direction in terms of what we're doing up here to try to resolve the competing concerns regarding the projections on whether this does what it intends to do, whether it gets completed, that really services the State of California from one end to the other. Those are issues that we deserve an answer to. Because I will tell you that when I was in the Assembly, I supported this.
2434	Melendez	Melissa	41	JX3K3k4qzkE	552	570	Well, I will answer that question and then I will allow Christy to add on to that if she'd like, but this is a matter of having people who are qualified to train you or anyone else up there on the dais of how to use this type of equipment in the event of an emergency. So, it's not just CPR, it's a use of an AED, a defibrillator.
2435	Galgiani	Cathleen	95	2Yu9E6dAMwM	107	121	In order to assure that children who are deaf and hard of hearing have the language foundation to enter kindergarten ready to learn, formal more milestones, benchmarks must be established and monitored.
2436	Beall	Jim	92	H1pQ8j20qSg	537	559	I'm terribly sorry for your family and the loss. Let's continue to work for this. This is so important. We need to make a steadfast effort to see that the standards are improved and I applaud Senator Monning for introducing the bill. So I urge an aye vote on this bill and would love to be added as co-author, Senator Monning.
2437	Stone	Jeff	26	sFefduhHol8	305	322	I think it's very clear that social workers in the State of California, they don't have any pay parity with what's being paid in counties. And that adjustment certainly has to happen if we're going to be retaining the very dedicated social workers that we have.
2438	Lara	Ricardo	107	kyRwF6Xn7UY	391	403	Moving on to AB 883, Employment, public employee status, do pass as amended per author to remove private employers from the bill. Substitute the role of AB 2, that bill is approved on a 5 to 2 vote with Republicans voting no.
2439	Lackey	Tom	10	mNQQzzy6ePQ	676	714	I'd like to agree with Assembly member Gonzales that the initiative process is a powerful expression and it's a it's a tool to get ideas and circumstances addressed in a legal fashion, but I do believe that this initiative only allows this decision to go back to the voters to clarify whether in fact they did understand that component of Prop 47. I say that this is a very important clarification that could result in saving lives, so it's definitely worth that review.
2440	Alejo	Luis	9	nhiEIYehp1Y	345	360	Further, this education increases a student's sense of American identity and what it means to be an American in today's diverse society. California has one of the largest and most diverse student populations in the nation with ethnic minorities accounting for over 71% of the student population.
2441	Chang	Ling Ling	18	Y0xkoNoudD0	180	202	In honor of women's history month I'd like to offer up two of my favorite quotes if you want something said ask a man, if you want something done ask a woman by Margaret thatcher, and then this one is my ultimate favorite which is well-behaved women seldom make history by Laurel...and with that, please repeat after me
2442	Hertzberg	Robert	99	CKAXbjP6mGQ	1110	1131	We're in a place where the marketplace is challenging us tremendously and legitimately. We have to be Californians. W1e have to be creative to figure out how we can make that happen. How we can bring jobs here where instead of importing some asset that provides our energy, we can domesticate that.
2443	Weber	Shirley	44	_YWoRdtfoP8	892	908	The number is so low and that's what I'm looking at, whether or not that there's flexibility to move this conversation to a bigger number in terms of performance because we're an educational institution, that ought to be the center of what we do, not the periphery.
2444	De Leon	Kevin	102	jjB76hKrhNA	554	575	Thank you again, Madam President. We have another Governor's appointment before us, that is Geoffrey Baum from Southern California. Governor's appointment to the California Community College Board of Governors. Mr. Baum was voted on, again, last week Wednesday, January 7th on a bipartisan vote. Four to zero.
2445	Roth	Richard	106	R_3K0Lk1jA4	1293	1315	So I'd ask the author to take a look at that and see if there was some, perhaps the prohibition should not apply until the hosting platform has been notified that there is a problem. I didn't see that in the bill. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
2446	Chang	Ling Ling	18	Y0xkoNoudD0	202	215	I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all.
2447	Dababneh	Matthew	50	0BI7ZwRm0UU	1548	1566	Could they check the dash cam? Could they look at security footage? Could they look at interview footage? Could they look at other types of evidence before they do the report. The world might not be as, you know, relevant as a body camera image could still provide outside perspective.
2448	Hertzberg	Robert	99	Rj2lrXkjDIw	1825	1835	So I don't look at it as a problem, I look at it as an extraordinary opportunity to reduce energy cost for businesses and families, an opportunity to be greener and to create more local jobs.
2449	Hertzberg	Robert	99	Rj2lrXkjDIw	1807	1825	So in my judgment, it's not the local person at net metering, this is really about fairness in the process, but it's about the larger dynamic, what we're going to be engaged in as policymakers at this committee and in the other house to really redefine what that new world order looks like about how do we use this excess energy.
2450	Wood	Jim	72	X-EMNVy0KVE	1884	1896	Just to thank the, thank the committee for their time, I appreciate that. I agree it's not a magic bullet, it's a step forward to try to begin to combat a problem that is beginning to grow in California.
2451	Beall	Jim	92	hQoyRwEukvY	498	522	We want to make this crystal clear that these are constitutionally protected and also require bi-partisan support from our esteemed colleagues in terms of any changes that would divert revenue Mr. Chairman- Of course I have no intention of allowing any of that to happen myself, I will never vote for that.
2452	Fuller	Jean	49	9celf0om_Bo	406	416	I am just going to say that I have developed faith in your ability to weather the system, and I appreciate it and going forward I am willing to support your candidacy.
2453	Leyva	Connie	62	9celf0om_Bo	420	449	Hello Patrick. It was very nice to see yesterday. It had been a long time. I enjoyed meeting with you, and as many others, very much appreciate the way you've turned around EDD. When I complimented you on that and told you what an impressive job you did, you were very humble in your response and said that the state legislature had helped, as had all the folks that are employed under you, which I think speaks to your character and why you have been so successful.
2454	Grove	Shannon	77	DunUs63qSXI	593	609	I also spoke to a foster care youth this week that told me that she's in her second placement in her home, and she's been seven months in this home, and she's with an all-Spanish speaking household and she does not speak any Spanish whatsoever.
2455	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	QnBcTK-as8k	653	664	I would like, that being said, I'm happy to work with the stakeholders, to build a safe harbor into the bill, with examples of notices that have followed would be deemed to comply with the law.
2456	Hernandez	Ed	103	IKy1yzt0SRs	1241	1278	To number one, to make sure we have an MCO tax, and to look additional revenues for Medicare reimbursement rates and developmentally disabled. So, in IHHS. So what I needed to do is put that into a package, and that's why they're put together.  There's two separate issues here.
2457	Hernandez	Roger	37	eYvHQ6iO6CE	1159	1172	Here with me to speak and support of AB253 are Pete Conaty, Lieutenant Colonel, Pete Conaty and associates and Stacy Hiramato director of the Racial and Ethnic Mental Health Disparities Coalition.
2458	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	7vSg9-FP5Qk	828	856	And so I'm gonna push it back to you to say, how do you keep that 1% from compromising something that might be a very good idea, which is body cameras. How do you plan to protect as a chief of the department? How do you plan to ensure that you get accurate information and you can use this as a tool for training, you can use this as a way to weed out the 1%, tell us.
2459	Hill	Jerry	66	EhsW00cBA0A	1795	1818	Senator Mcguire this is I think it's timely and that sharing Senator Hernandez's concern we've seen numerous bills coming forward and every time they stumble, there's a problem. It may be related to who was sponsoring the bill at the time and the, let's see, paranoia, but the concern around the issue and who is bringing what forward in the legislation.
2460	McGuire	Mike	93	EhsW00cBA0A	1772	1790	And we brought seven counties together. What we'll call the impact counties, that see the most cultivation in the state. And we actually had individuals from Colorado come speak with the board of supervisors and county administrators, exactly what you had just mentioned, so I really appreciate you bringing that up. And that is going to be a major focus for us moving forward.
2461	Hancock	Loni	98	C_-Yvm-Yyn0	4	22	Just to pick up on that, I think that's a great point. In a way, the state has the ability to have an overview, and it should be able to have a vision of what best practices are across the state and really across the country.
2462	Pan	Richard	96	a6D1KFF96cc	1060	1074	Our immigrants, our family members, neighbors, friends, colleagues and loved ones. Unfortunately, these Californians are the most vulnerable to discrimination, hate crimes and in unequal access to the most basic daily functions, such as eating in restaurants with their family.
2463	Nguyen	Janet	65	lA7lgET9urw	262	275	Prior to serving, joining the Senate, I served as the County Supervisor in that capacity. As some of you might know, I served on CalOptima, which is Orange County's organized health system.
2464	Cooper	Jim	21	-kB_gg_15b8	187	196	I'd just like to thank the chair and also chair Jackson for convening this. I think it is a timely issue to bring forward, and I look forward to the very healthy discussion.
2465	Mitchell	Holly	64	STpdTC9YNMw	1762	1780	Thank you very much. Senator Monning, what did you just tell me, we're going to go back to LAO?  Wants to respond to the last two at all.  Excellent, thank you very much for bringing forth your investment proposals. And we'll take public comment. Appreciate it. Yes, yes.
2466	Bonta	Rob	85	cFLwRY925G8	248	270	Thank you. I wanna thank my colleagues in both the Assembly and the Senate for being here and participating in this important discussion and wanna now open it up for an opportunity for any members who wish, you don't have to, but if you wish, to make any opening remarks on this topic. Please, Mr. Lackey.
2467	Leno	Mark	60	-absEc_YvaI	334	357	And so, it's nice to say that they have discretion, but without funds they're not going to be able to cover all of their needs. So, I just want to share a brief story. We have the opportunity to be shadowed by a fostered youth every year, and I know many of us do that, and I had a young woman who was my shadow this past year.
2468	Bates	Pat	58	2Dc5I9_7zFA	2066	2088	Because it's not accessible. We have a huge development being developed right by a metro link station, that to get to it is as probably as the crow flies within half a mile, but you'd have to go over a wash and crawl over a fence. So that developer would need to build a bridge to get over there, which probably is more expensive than putting more parking in.
2469	Mitchell	Holly	64	71cBx2pj13o	2	19	Just a quick question sir, if I may. And I'm not sure if I should direct this to the department or LAL. But when I look at the LAL report and in listening to some of your questions Mr. Chair. The LAL report page 2 that talks about some of the federal requirements that may be waived.
2470	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	RORFPzwiDnU	71	87	Thank you, Madame Chair and good morning. AB 566 requires contractors and any subcontractors for lease-leaseback and lease to own projects to use a skilled and trained workforce at the school site once construction would occur.
2471	Obernolte	Jay	86	etnGLuiVGv4	2039	2055	can move into their new facility. That will preserve access to that critical hospital for the citizens of Tehachpi. Now I'm aware in this chamber that quite often haters gonna hate and bills always seem to have opposition but in this case there is no opposition to this bill. There's no need to
2472	Weber	Shirley	44	gT2_z9UGrSs	1580	1593	I just simply want to thank you for the proposal. I'm probably not going to vote for it because I don't, there's a lot of complex pieces to it. But I know that LA Unified is too large. Period.
2473	Cooper	Jim	21	k0jwR3_bc5U	632	666	Just to add on, in the Sacramento area one of the reasons some of the suburban communities pass restrictive legislation, we've had a number of marijuana rip-offs, where we had a lot of homicides here. It's a real issue that's gone on. Numerous document cases throughout the Sacramento alley region and that's why the jurisdictions passed those tough ordinances to prevent that. It's a real problem. You're so you're right: what fits, you know, the rural community doesn't necessarily fit the suburban community.
2474	Mullin	Kevin	31	etnGLuiVGv4	2065	2092	Thank you Mr. Obernolte. Seeing no discussion or debate on the item, clerk will open the roll. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote.  Clerk well close the roll, tally the vote. Ayes 72, no's zero on the urgency. Ayes 72, no's zero on the bill, measure passes.
2475	Gipson	Mike	28	EgZgFkyj3MQ	2061	2088	Suroni played the cello, the piano, the guitar. She was a lead vocalist on their first gospel album of their church. She loved music. She received her bachelor's degree in the business of administration from California State University Long Beach. Suroni used her talents and academic achievements to create a lunch program, where they fed kids during the summer.
2476	McCarty	Kevin	22	XYWDulv6x4s	612	643	Okay. Thank you. No more comments on this item. We're going to hold this item open until the, May revision but, the bottom line is, you heard it, we're, you know, the sub committee is a big supporter of the CSU system and would like to, focus on what's in the Governor's budget. Plus go at least $97 million to, focusing on fulfilling the master plan and serve anybody who can benefit from the CSU system.
2477	Nielsen	Jim	68	qIsKWbokTQE	647	667	Assemblyman, I am concerned as well, and I'm reasonably familiar with other certification procedures in different agencies for different things. And there is a specific criteria, but the certification goes beyond that, and there's an enforcing mechanism, and there are penalties.
2478	Bloom	Richard	2	w6A3dw8D_mc	815	835	Good conversation to have, good thing for us all to be talking about, but the LAO has recently released a report on the housing crisis, and the administration at least when it comes to this particular issue, is providing a pathway to something that I personally believe is important.
2479	Pan	Richard	96	KTS25NPAjyE	1867	1885	So, I'm hoping we can have some further conversations about that. Just to make sure we get that nailed down tight. So, I'm gonna be supportive of the bill today, because I think it needs to move forward. I just hope that we can maybe look at that a little harder, just to be sure we're not creating a situation where, especially in those rare conditions.
2480	Block	Marty	59	nlURi31-KJY	1207	1220	eight years together at that point I moved on to the Assembly, Bill remained at the disrtrict until 2012. When we were elected it was really a seat change in the board of trustees
2481	Liu	Carol	63	31W9cfaQWLY	1161	1202	Thank you, Mr. President. This Saturday, family and friends mourn the loss of an honored life of a world-renowned Pasadena artist Mr. Raul Ruben Rodriguez. Mr. Rodriguez is  best-known for designing more than 500 rose parade floats over his 56 year career. He designed his first float when he was fifteen-years-old, a snow scene, for the City of Whittier and his final one last year in 2014.
2482	Fuller	Jean	49	WnmFSvHbO0k	182	206	SB 111 will declare the Legislature's intent to meet the matching share requirements of school construction grant program by directing the Department of Finance to explore funding options including low-interest loans through the bank. We are not appropriating, we're asking to look for other sources of funding for the match. California has 28 public schools on
2483	Mitchell	Holly	64	IoZYTkhJCFY	617	636	So I applaud you for Pushing the envelope. Because again I just think it's important that it was perceived as a floor and not the ceiling. And we've got to go beyond as opposed to still forty years later trying to get state agencies to just kind of meet that entry level standard. We've got to get better than that. Thank you for carrying the bill.
2484	Nguyen	Janet	65	qBs9W23Am_w	280	292	After the end of the United States' involvement in the Vietnam War, the United Nations High Commission on Refugees established the Orderly Departure Program to assist refugees fleeing Vietnam.
2485	Lara	Ricardo	107	JQ5xKCGxzzk	224	239	These differences between civil and penal code are dangerous and threaten to allow sexual predators and indifferent entities off the hook for child abuse and negligence. SB 14 will close this loophole and ensure victim's rights are protected. Respectfully ask for your aye vote.
2486	Quirk	Bill	23	k0jwR3_bc5U	240	254	Okay. Then, finally, these grows are already illegal and I'm certainly going to support your bill, the problem is that how will this help us get rid of these illegal grows if we can't do it now when they're already illegal?
2487	McGuire	Mike	93	EhsW00cBA0A	261	286	Rogue operators have clear cut thousands of acres of forests illegally, both on public and private lands, without regard for the long-term impacts they are creating for neighboring landowners, downstream farms, or endangered species. They've dumped tens of thousands of pounds of illegal pesticides, rodenticides, and fertilizers into wilderness communities. They're also sucking our rivers and streams dry.
2488	Beall	Jim	92	kIQkyQM4CnQ	102	114	I think I'll go along with that. I think it obviously is something that has to be discussed further. So basically I'm voting to keep the discussion going. Thank you.
2489	Block	Marty	59	qnIAoFuwUn0	1821	1837	Same things goes with moving the block grants from this. You will hear from a lot of, and doesn't mean it's not a good idea, but if we go to a block grant there will be a number of groups that are represented in the governor's allocation right now.
2490	Mitchell	Holly	64	J9Q3Kd_PmWQ	189	213	That brings us to item number seven on the agenda, the proposals for investment. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I skipped it, I'm sorry. Number three ... Number six,- [Mr. Rose] Six. - BCP number 83, implementing Child Victimsof Human Trafficking, page 29 of the agenda.
2491	Chiu	David	7	OACKM5KF8Sk	1507	1528	Most recommendations appear to be relatively procedural around establishing criteria and developing procedures and requiring various actors to provide plans. At the end the day CMS has said that we have a goal of trying to increase by 10% children who enrolled in Medicaid receiving dental services.
2492	Garcia	Eduardo	38	bXJhxM-W13s	877	889	I think our Vice-Chairwoman has a question and then, just to remind the members, we will have an opportunity to bring these two gentlemen back if there are any other questions after our next two panels.
2493	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	_Xf-JuWDBj0	972	994	But I do think it really, I'm a recent grandma, and it's been a long time since I had to focus on how hard it is to work with your own child on an eight, ten hour a day basis. And the best part about being a grandparent, besides the great joy of having a common enemy is-
2494	Thurmond	Tony	4	9UYl1IR1e0U	555	574	And truthfully, I've met many students who have been expelled, didn't even know that they had a hearing to go to. Their families didn't even know. Almost every expulsion that I experienced in many districts. Traditional public schools I haven't had the chance to attend any hearings in a charter school.
2495	Wood	Jim	72	KcpO7Oo2ci0	1251	1258	So I thank you, thank you for your effort and I'm committed to looking for a solution for this. But I'm not sure this is where I can go right now.
2496	Bonilla	Susan	3	llrxaJMn6L0	1513	1527	Thank you. And our final bill of the morning is Mr. Ting, AB 1073. Do we have another one? Oh Jones. We have two. Alright we'll start with you Mr. Ting. Vice-chair will wait patiently.
2497	McGuire	Mike	93	LuelkxPlWfo	1567	1585	So currently, it is very difficult to be able to understand, how many vacation rentals are in your community. Because no one reports them. If we take a look at communities up and down the coast, the vast majority of vacation rentals are not going through the city or county for registration.
2498	De Leon	Kevin	102	jjB76hKrhNA	775	783	move forward dealing with drought, as well as climate change. We have a fertile environment throughout the State of California for these types of fires. I respectfully ask for an aye vote.
2499	Beall	Jim	92	nqnHx0FnCOc	95	121	and how many Californians, I guess you might put it that way, are in those facilities. Are there other people in the facilities? And then the per-inmate cost per unit, per facility. And the contract amount and name of the location of the contractor in and out of the state. And what level of security are the various people that we send to those states?
2500	Gatto	Mike	46	L_fXwOpVblo	666	686	I have two daughters, one is five, one is two. You start with a lack of information and it's hard to trace back how little people know, but how many people before I stood here today knew that the state of California had this bank with the blood of every child born in the last 30 years?
2501	Weber	Shirley	44	sxH5Xtvq9A4	299	310	So what we're looking at is people who are stopped because we perceive them to be a certain way. And that's what profiling is all about. And that becomes important. It's different if you give a report and everybody's ethnicity's there.
2502	Eggman	Susan Talamantes	73	N6EhWxD1_nY	782	793	I mean not many of us sitting up here do know what every single label means or ingredient and which ones are dangerous and which ones aren't. And who's got the time then to go look all those things up to see if it's dangerous or not?
2503	Hertzberg	Robert	99	Q93W3yN07bU	528	540	That seems to me to be the real debate but I don't think stealing copper is, it's a legitimate issue in the community, I've seen it, but I don't think on this case, where you've got to fill out a form of the thief, it's going to actually reach that goal.
2504	Allen	Benjamin	70	vOdSCzF5aoo	1265	1275	I just want to throw out the idea that, you know, our entire state budget is perhaps, you know, more subject to market volatility than the CSU's budget would be under this proposal.
2505	Garcia	Cristina	112	60U_LMI0eIw	1083	1099	And a lot of them don't tip. And so this idea that we're gonna base this off tips is unfair not to send this to this industries but a lot of other industries. So I think we need to explore that also along the way so that these individuals are able to provide for their needs and provide for their kids and make sure that basic needs are being met.
2506	Weber	Shirley	44	sxH5Xtvq9A4	310	323	And you go after that individual after the fact. But we're talking about the perception that exists and causes an individual to be stopped for that reason. It's kinda like stopping a kid who has a car that's dropped to the ground and has a lot of noise.
2507	Cannella	Anthony	61	KHtTIUat0hU	2025	2042	Also, I am concerned that large hydro is excluded. My district largely benefits from hydropower and so if we're going to double down on these policies, we're going to have basically, hydro which generates a large part of the power and then we're going to have to buy renewables.
2508	Leno	Mark	60	wlFflIxZr_U	939	950	And with regard to school mandates, is there as dramatic a range in what we have submitted to the state for repayment as we see in the general mandates? Because I know, sometimes we're-
2509	Huff	Bob	105	VyoFcVtTJtQ	1749	1763	So, you know, not that people do this willingly, but every now and then, they do. And so now you have a board that is going to review this and can you describe who makes up this review board, the disciplinary board?
2510	Stone	Jeff	26	oIK91dkxix0	1106	1126	About a five-year process. Okay. So, I don't see anything wrong with having goals and getting to an endpoint, especially when you have the financial issues with the lack of federal funding, not accepting new patients at you know, Sonoma as an example, and which is inflating the cost per, per patient.
2511	Bates	Pat	58	_Bb4hK8XVqo	118	159	That they are prepared to put them to projects and get those projects out very quickly. So the conversation that I'd like to direct us to today and I was supposed to have someone who might be an expert in discussing a subvention concept for STIP funding, to share some of that in our discussion and I'm not sure if we have someone from LAO or our consultants themselves, that might at least explain how the subvention process work and how it would work here with transportation revenues.
2512	Gatto	Mike	46	G0q0929_P6I	304	315	It's been said that the worst thing to hear from the government is that we are the government and we're here to help. We though, I think acknowledge that the state has to take some kind of action here.
2513	Jones	Brian	42	8g5e-OGL0_Y	1050	1068	crutches and eventually became wheelchair-bound. Despite facing great adversity Barbara was able to attend college where she worked diligently to earn her Masters degree in marriage and family therapy. Eventually owning a private practice for many years, during a professional career she treated many kinds of mental health issues
2514	Mitchell	Holly	64	2MXVIex_Zeg	198	225	The governor said that we could not do better than this for low-income families, unless we establish what he called, the quote English style welfare state of twenty years ago, end quote. And we know that based on actual testimony in both this subcommittee, and the select committee on women inequality that I chair, that there is actually a more recent successful British strategy for cutting specifically child poverty in half.
2515	Bonta	Rob	85	kPgAxyWoE4o	24	70	Couple of quick announcements, we'll hear two witnesses per side with a time limit of three minutes each on each bill. Additional witnesses please state only your name and organization for the record and your position on the measure. In order to allow everyone a chance to be heard during the public comment period, please make sure to limit your testimony to your name, organization, or city and your position on the measure. The sergeant-at-arms will monitor and if need be, cut off anyone not adhering to those requirements. Please no clapping, booing, or other disruptive behavior during the hearing. Again, the sergeants will be involved, and escort anyone out of the hearing room, who's displaying such behavior from the hearing room and not allowing us to conduct this important state business and have this hearing proceed in an efficient way.
2516	Hall	Isadore	1	ewcXToh_gOY	1238	1248	But the expansion of sales when we're trying to address already a clean up situation I won't be able to support the bill. You can close if you like.
2517	Liu	Carol	63	wHx-nZg7Thw	1198	1213	You're very generous. So the recommendation would be changing the January 1st, 2017, date to June 30th, 2016, and then also making sure that the Committee here, receives a report.
2518	Hernandez	Roger	37	ukB39_tnTUw	2032	2051	I used to be a member of the League of Cities, I was a councilman for eight years. They are a conservative voice and it seems to me that anything that has to do with improving voter turnout seems to be a threat. And they communicate their opposition whenever we're trying to do anything to even have stronger adherence to Voting Rights Act.
2519	Cooley	Ken	45	gmSplS1IxCE	335	352	I want to say this is an outstanding measure both for policy. Its key hallmarks which you've heard are we have an overarching agency at the state-level of government that'll establish the framework for the oversight of medical marijuana, 19 years after the voter said that's what we should do.
2520	McGuire	Mike	93	Fo002GsDq6Y	614	627	flip, but trying-to summarize why I believe it really is a culture of coziness at the PUC. Ms. Behles discussed the potential of an unfair advantage, and it absolutely exists.
2521	Chau	Ed	116	mb2tyA5yp6Q	51	75	If the court determines that the motion will further judicial economy, however, these provisions inadvertently sunsetted on January 1st, 2015. In 2005, an amendment to AB 1742, which was a noncontroversial Judicial Committee Omnibus Bill inserted the word 'post-offer' into the Code of Civil Procedure, section 998.
2522	Lara	Ricardo	107	_6tc2cojjY8	163	176	Thank you comments or questions from committee? Seeing any none and hearing none without any objection will move this item to suspense. I see we have Assemblymember Holden. Please come forward. Members this is AB 220.
2523	Nielsen	Jim	68	BifOW5Vhe4Q	1810	1824	Well, Mr. Chairman I don't think I'd called the governor's, I don't want to call him conservative but would say restrained. I would argue in these volatile times that maybe restraint is a better way to start off with.
2524	Weber	Shirley	44	_ES7C4KFvkc	1651	1662	This would actually fund other beginning transportation programs, is that correct? Or I mean, one point this talks about cost of living and you're saying expansion of the transportation program.
2525	Frazier	Jim	114	Qd8yv7EufE4	463	485	I fear the lack of public participation in elections is an emergency on, at least, the same scale, and this is why I'm supporting your bill. But should anyone get the wrong idea, I do not intend to encourage broader use of these signs in the future. And so, I'm looking forward to your successful venture with this passage of this bill.
2526	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	JG7mRMz5Gp8	1485	1496	Thank you. Thank you Mr. Alejo. And again, my concern is that there be a higher bar than just the word cause. And I too thought this had been worked out. So that was my understanding when I walked in the room today. So with that, Madame Secretary please call the roll.
2527	Mendoza	Tony	52	5EeaivfMcyY	937	946	That is part and parcel to court reporter services in California. In fact, in the state of Texas. Where at least, where some of the opponents, that is there home state. There is Texas law, that limits and restricts the ability of parties or I'm sorry, of those companies that are producing the transcripts, from giving favorable contracts to one party and not the other.
2528	Allen	Benjamin	70	MbrLwdg2wyw	500	520	Thank you. Thanks. Alright,we are actually going to quickly turn to Portion eight of the agenda and ask Mona Field and Kathay Feng to come up and testify briefly before the committee about the Reform Commission.
2529	Leyva	Connie	62	898OiW72jWg	1797	1818	I haven't heard anyone say that they're not doing a good job, but we wanna eliminate some of them, for whatever reason, and of course, I always support efficiency. We want to make sure things are done quickly and efficiently and the way they are supposed to be done, but I'm worried that all we are talking about is eliminating positions when we're trying to fix our roads and our infrastructure.
2530	Hill	Jerry	66	N-Bfbq4TmhI	1704	1717	Yeah, I would. Thank you, Senator Hernandez. I, and I would like to just respond to the, to some of the comments. And I appreciate where they have been, they've been working, working hard on trying to resolve and come together on the communication aspect of the bill.
2531	Gomez	Jimmy	80	kLTY4thtXsA	603	613	There's a lot of things we can do, but I would encourage you to work with some of the other folks that have bills. I wouldn't want to have to double join the bills so that you would be forced to work together.
2532	Williams	Das	12	jAVMxyN_c9U	428	444	What I feel about guidelines, you might ask Jack Sparrow or watch those Pirate of the Caribbean movies about guidelines. Guidelines are very loosy goosy. And, that is not how we are going to create jobs or renewable energy in the state.
2533	Wood	Jim	72	LW2wm2tITKQ	443	459	Most subdivisions are developed upon and the revenue from development can be used to pay for fire protection. If land remains open space, there is no new revenue and families are often forced to develop or sell their pieces of land to developers, loosing the open space.
2534	Bloom	Richard	2	1kBpFTHnX5o	89	103	This will eliminate cities that rush to issue bonds in 2011 in order to lock up funds for future projects that didn't even exist at that time, which was a concern of the Governor and some other folks.
2535	McGuire	Mike	93	nfRac3nHOas	61	74	Just a couple of items. One is... Just want to talk about incentivizing I think some of the challenges that come directly off of the Sonoma County Board of Supervisors last December.
2536	Dodd	Bill	71	JfU4ybXUoBc	820	832	It, it only clarifies which existing sections of the code apply when regulating district fairs. California's 52 district fairs outnumber county fairs by more than two to one in community pillars where they operate.
2537	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	NRrL3g0f7-g	227	260	We have Mr. Achadjian? Mr. Dodd? We got Dodd. This is Garcia?  Brenden, Baker, and Hernandez. Oh, okay. Ms. Weber, would you like to present? Thank you, Ms. Weber. So, Ms. Weber will present on...
2538	Bonta	Rob	85	iF8zLPAheNg	1758	1779	Understood Mr. Speaker thank you very much. Just want to address the issue of edibles because it has come up in the past and I just want to make some points. In a prior debate there was a comment something to the extent that right now with respect to edibles it was like the wild west. And to that I agree. That's exactly why this bill is needed
2539	Hill	Jerry	66	pqf8UezhQwo	1194	1209	I just wanted to comment. It's an excellent bill. It is part of that comprehensive goal I think we all have, to achieve better results from the PUC and I thank the chair and the chair and Senator Leno for being part of that.
2540	Cooley	Ken	45	zjh5VKf9m04	1354	1372	I was just gonna make the observation that at some point, it'd be perhaps smart to ask staff to reach out to the American Academy of Pediatrics, find that area within the actuarial field where you have folks who specialize in these sorts of issues, dealing with the long-time horizon, the variation in the population.
2541	Bonta	Rob	85	iF8zLPAheNg	1779	1794	because it adds regulation to all areas of the cannabis industry including edibles. For currently in the status quo there are zero regulations with regard to testing and packaging and labeling of edibles but now with this bill
2542	Bonta	Rob	85	y1QKa01q6Wg	39	65	Item number 1, bill HR 26, author Lowe, item number 7, SB 282, Hernandez, item number 9, SB 319, Senator Bell, item number 12, SB 503, Senator Hernandez, item number 16, SB 675, Senator Liu with amendments and Item number 17, SJR 8, Senator Hernandez. So with that we're ready for our first author.
2543	Cooper	Jim	21	0BI7ZwRm0UU	1278	1289	And I, I talked to, representative from Oakland PD the other day, and there are times in emergency situations where you're jumping out of that car and your first thing you're going to do is draw your weapon.
2544	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	eiRf682j8LU	2023	2042	Thank you. Thank you. Thank you Ms. Weber and I didn't know what it meant to be Irish til my oldest brother took a Irish ethnic studies class at San Diego State of all places. So there's many a St. Patrick Day and much more at my house after that.
2545	Bonta	Rob	85	doJlNdYlHmM	1006	1026	There was a time when the industry agreed to the current approach to pension many years back. And it's essentially a pay-as-you-go approach. I think we all realize today with the experience we've gone through with different entities, including our own state, that that's maybe not the best approach and that we need to have some changes.
2546	De Leon	Kevin	102	DaiegGG5yrM	1381	1400	there is quote, unquote maintenance being conducted we just endured that, just recently a few months ago a Exxon-Mobil refinery station down in Torrance, California, up in northern California and Ms. Bonilla, there was all of a sudden there was a fire and also, what did we witness? We witness prices go up.
2547	Bates	Pat	58	fSCMT0VJDKw	2206	2224	And they are looking for opportunities, and I know it should be local discretion. This moves them more quickly in that direction, if there are areas that still are resistant to the new palettes that are out there in drought tolerant and in synthetic turf. So I'm include to support it.
2548	Wieckowski	Bob	55	A2CxN21_Gyw	1783	1799	Somebody who wrote a will fifteen years ago, thinks it's perfectly good. We've got different results here. I guess that is the question is when you say deceased users express consent for disclosure of the contents.
2549	Pan	Richard	96	h3qpDny4S5o	1039	1052	The other issue is actually I know that Dr Woods mentioned about provider survey since I in past-life did lots of provider surveys, can you tell me what the sample size and the rate of return is for that survey response rate?
2550	Beall	Jim	92	vppxPTwkbs8	2005	2042	I think it would have a dividend for the state in a social, economic way in terms of benefiting families in California that have a need to find work. So, I think these pre-apprenticeship programs working with our labor organizations are really good ideas for job training, working with Conservation Corps and those types of groups to do more of the routine kind of tasks.
2551	De Leon	Kevin	102	9wfdC9HGDSQ	2023	2044	Now these appointments were heard in the rules committee on January 21 and were approved on a bi-partisan vote 5 to 0 no opposition. Not only is Mr. Xaviar highly qualified to run the Department of Rehabilitation but he is in fact an inspirational leader. For those who don't know, Mr. Xavier is blind and to be the Director of one
2552	Chiu	David	7	h1jaLifdzdM	641	656	Let's be clear, there's nothing in this legislation that refers to faith-based organizations. We're talking about any centers that are reporting to provide certain types of health options and we're saying again for unlicensed facilities, it's a simple two line notice where you say the facility is unlicensed and there are no licensed medical providers on staff.
2553	Leno	Mark	60	w0YskQ9utlg	295	315	So, we have each of those three categories. I'm not sure if we're time limited. I can walk you through each of the three or just conclude and ask-- allow you to ask questions as you choose, Mr. Chair. Would you like me to go through them?
2554	Chavez	Rocky	83	ZXZJp00flVo	2438	2447	You know, the work as a staff because we're so short staffed over there is just amazing, so, I want to publicly thank both of these two great professionals so, thank you.
2555	Bloom	Richard	2	-bJq_JGSuxY	1087	1111	To speak to that issue. For the bill and chief, Mr. Chair and members, thank you. Energy efficiency is the first call of the State's loading order before procurement of renewable energy and conventional power. And of course it is also the cheapest source of power that we have because every megawatt that's conserved is one that doesn't have to be purchased later.
2556	McCarty	Kevin	22	ZXZJp00flVo	2448	2464	Okay, while we're at it, I wanted to thank certainly our staff as well, and also I wanted to recognize the department of finance and LAO and all the advocates who helped provide insight on some of these issues and just kind of a big picture.
2557	De Leon	Kevin	102	_C-l6C8Fln0	459	494	They gave me as all others here today an opportunity to succeed and that's why we're here today. I'm living proof that the work we do here, the work we do here on this red carpet, on the Senate Floor matters. It matters for all children. Again, regardless of who they are, regardless of where they come from, regardless of the color of their skin or the language they speak or where their parents come, from regardless of their legal status.
2558	Mitchell	Holly	64	zKRXexcG8LM	62	88	Thank you very much, Mr. President and members. I'm proud to be a part of the package of legislation that I am jump-starting here dealing with a critical public policy issue that's been addressed informational hearings, several of which have already occurred and will continue through the interim season, and that's dealing with the notion of  psychotropic drugs and their use among our foster care population.
2559	Nazarian	Adrin	36	leAiZf7wn9s	15	35	Since the mid 1980s, law enforcement agencies have engaged in the collection of personal information to label and track people overwhelmingly among this population, youth and adults of color as gang members.
2560	Dodd	Bill	71	RxWs3TzpYXg	338	352	AB 527 would allow licensed alcohol manufacturers and distributors to sponsor events of or purchase advertising space from a live entertainment company that has its principle place of business in the county of Napa.
2561	Leno	Mark	60	EE5x4AZj6R4	1651	1665	I concur with the professor. To answer the Chair's question, BART uses approximately 390,000 megawatt hours per year. The peak is 80 megawatts, and that's about as much electricity as the city of Alameda.
2562	Gomez	Jimmy	80	rzSOQHmJW3U	390	417	B roll call. SB 387 Jackson, State bar annual dues and audit of the State bar. Do pass with amendments requiring the State Bar to comply with the California Public Records Act and the Bagley-Keene Open Meetings Act. A roll call. SB 400 Lara, funding High Speed Rail construction mitigation, hold in Committee.
2563	Hernandez	Roger	37	Tqcxk8QJsXU	1261	1296	It's going to cost you $8000 extra, $8000 extra and this is while she was being readied for surgery. Folks thig is happening to folks every day. I had to pull out a checkbook right there to make sure my mom was able to get the best opportunity to save her life right there, but what about for the average California that doesn't have $8000, $20,000 ready to go within 15 minutes of surgery.
2564	Hill	Jerry	66	ZLCilf2DCec	1637	1663	This measure does not make any changes to any vote thresholds. Measures would still need a two-thirds vote of the county's residence approval, simply allows both counties to pose the question before their respective residents. There's broad support for the measure. I ask for your aye vote on concurrence to the Assembly amendments.
2565	Cooley	Ken	45	Gv0uyUPdJmA	756	772	Vision Service Plan, the biggest provider of vision plans in our country is headquartered in my district just a short distance away. So I've been working very close with them, and I have John Valencia Here to testify on behalf of VSP.
2566	Atkins	Toni	110	ymi21hh5WVg	512	535	Because it happened, because there is a price, so you're right, right? But there is a process that, at times, you are required to liquidate an estate. It's trust and estates law as it relates to, maybe we'd have to add in some language about forcing an heir to decide to take one of these items or something.
2567	Liu	Carol	63	tIl0bzr-tVs	151	165	Which can increase educational outcomes and is protective factor against other social and emotional harms. The bill does not provide additional transportation for youth wishing, wishing to stay in their school of origin, and thus is a low cost solution.
2568	McGuire	Mike	93	MOa6yahtOBc	275	298	Absolutely and I think that what the data has shown is that those individual physicians that are involved within the foster care system in the state, we do see a higher number of incentives. Extra curricular, financial or otherwise, right? That are being distributed. So I hear you, and I appreciate that.
2569	Levine	Marc	8	0Mh9_vffhyY	24	33	When I asked Speaker Atkins to create this committee, my hope was that it would serve as an opportunity to have a public dialogue about two important sectors in California's robust economy.
2570	Baker	Catharine	74	Gf9OHu0urRM	326	343	Okay. And like Senate Roth, I went to law school because numbers weren't my big thing. But I have been able to crunch some of the numbers that you've just provided and are available, and from what I can tell from 2008 to 2013 there's been 182% cumulative increase in nonresident students.
2571	Hueso	Ben	48	sCQOMUPHoy8	69	86	If any of you can remember paying $2 for gasoline that was really the last time we convened here in the senate to talk about such a subject. Today, we saw gas prices decline and then spike up yet again.
2572	Gallagher	James	108	95pquWUVfBw	513	521	The nice staff will help you with insurance or aid from the state if you need it.  They will fill out all the paperwork for you.  They will find a doctor for you.
2573	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	QkQlxH8U7IE	1342	1365	And you realize the irony is they could go ahead and burn the flag and that would be okay. But their decision, the First Amendment can be a very interesting issue, which is why I was hoping we might hear from the ACLU. And I totally respect what you're trying to do. It's this First Amendment has created a very fascinating challenge to us all.
2574	Bonilla	Susan	3	mCVaWE-xXHw	1622	1639	perhaps the owner didn't speak English, and we needed to make sure that we were having really clear communication around the inspections. Also, requires the board to establish a health and safety advisory committee, to provide recommendations. Requires the board, I already mentioned this,
2575	Patterson	Jim	119	9-tqw489jZ4	3	39	Thank Mr. Chairman and members. I do rise in support as Vice Chair of the Utility and Commerce Committee and congratulate my colleague for the bill. Couple of key points here. One is that the intention here is to analyze, amongst a lot of other factors, the economic aspects of this policy. )ur rate payers deserve a grid that is stable and a grid that is affordable. There's been talk here on
2576	Bates	Pat	58	iJn9H0iEehM	331	353	Any other questions from board members other than myself? I have a quick question for Assemblymember Perea. I understand that the Department of Industrial Relations has asked you to narrow the bill. And that you do intend to take some amendments as it goes to education. That would exempt the specific labor managed apprenticeship programs.
2577	Hueso	Ben	48	Pf4MoAduOhU	568	598	Our next speaker, last but not least, Jose Blanco. Jose is a partner at the Central Valley Fund. He has also served as a Regional Vice President Chief Investment Officer at AIG Investment Corporation. In that role, he was responsible for making direct investments with the company's portfolio assets in Europe. Welcome Don Jose, and you have 10 minutes for your presentation.
2578	Mitchell	Holly	64	nJXs6pD2ors	1124	1140	Secondly, I'd also like to make a quick correction. The bill was amended in policy committee to remove the requirement that students receive an eye exam every other year. It now requires examination either prior to enrollment and limit check-ups to occur twice before the eighth grade.
2579	Hill	Jerry	66	k4GcCA0Jbo4	741	751	The bill also requires users of license plate readers to adopt a privacy and use policy to record, to keep a record of when data is accessed and to protect the data with reasonable security safeguards.
2580	Bonta	Rob	85	7CixOREAkbE	1265	1281	Additional questions or comments from members? Mr. Chair, I just want to thank you for your leadership on this issue, this is an absolutely critical consumer protection goal that you've set forth. Do we have a motion, and a second.
2581	Nielsen	Jim	68	BdgXqTHNkdY	1047	1069	Twenty years he worked there and I got to listen to Peter many times appearing before the Senate.  After that he worked in the state treasures office as assistant treasurer. Then he was Executive Director of the Debt Investment Advisory Commission as a part of the treasures office.
2582	Dodd	Bill	71	gKbbsG2YN94	1163	1186	District attorneys have little incentive to prosecute do to limited resources and lack of expertise. Though the secretary of food and agriculture can choose to levy penalties on her own, this is infrequent, meaning communities are often without recourse.
2583	Nielsen	Jim	68	BdgXqTHNkdY	1069	1088	In 1999, the Assembly was lucky enough to get him to come over and head the Republican fiscal staff. Over those years, he made his mark on government and on the budget. Very few could ever claim to have the knowledge of the intricacies, the interrelationships, and the importance of the California State Budget.
2584	Melendez	Melissa	41	_3f-5R48ZaU	1533	1553	But it's amazing when you sit down and just talk openly and candidly and truthfully about your needs and wants, how much you can get accomplished. I just think we're there now, I think it's a little less talk, right? Let's get something in. So I appreciate your comments and that's all I have, Mr. Chairman, thank you.
2585	Perea	Henry	33	ZI4xP65SSCE	452	473	The development of the formulary would involve a stakeholder advisory committee and would take effect no later than January 1, 2017. Establishing a formulary is not a new concept. It has been adopted in other states' work comp systems, and is widely used in group health, MediCal, Medicare and other federal healthcare programs.
2586	Bonilla	Susan	3	ik8_Xx3XS1w	715	726	To try to make this program even better than what it has been. And I think bottom line it is an issue of consistency and quality across the entire state.
2587	Weber	Shirley	44	gf6xiaI75uY	1432	1451	someone who could help in difficult times as we've seen in the last three or four years. So, it's a good concept. I think no one believes that there should be fraud. Those kinds of things that are there and even with the issue, I'm not if there's that much fraud in charter schools. Maybe there is. I've not seen that much before.
2588	Hall	Isadore	1	Gcdptg51L2I	226	244	Members, California is to home to the largest population of immigrants in the United States of America whose contributions to help to drive the state to be the most economically successful and prosperous nation.
2589	Thurmond	Tony	4	Pt85ouWZSag	1091	1109	Very good. Ms. Cantwell talked about the work that the department is doing to expedite these recommendations, and I believe that. So, I will just say that this is of high interest of this committee, and we would like to have an information come forward shortly, keep us up to date.
2590	Hueso	Ben	48	UK_Tt44TN2Q	86	109	Treating chromium 6, removing it from the water has never been done in the state's history. It's always been an element that we've just accepted as a part of our water and it has been shown in large quanitities to have detrimental health effects on the people in the population.
2591	Cooley	Ken	45	1NZUtvyVKUY	1310	1322	So I just wanna throw that out there. At this point, I have Mr. Sheehee also, representing the California Police Chief Association, but I would turn to Mr. Cromartie for the League of Cities. Subject to your guidance, Madam Chair.
2592	Hernandez	Ed	103	nMgNQIdoyHs	686	709	Tobacco remains the leading cause of preventable death and  kills 480,000 individuals in the United States, 34,000 in California. Tobacco use kills more individuals per year than alcohol, murder, illegal drugs, AIDS, and motor vehicle accidents, according to the CDC. Additionally, it is estimated that 90% of lifetime users start before the age of 21.
2593	Hill	Jerry	66	V40hlwpKzww	484	502	Sure, I have a question on the, you mentioned in, this is more for clarification I guess, for members to, my understanding is that your comment call, provide care until you reach the point where it's beyond your ability to provide that care.
2594	Gipson	Mike	28	cmFW6p4IGdA	9	26	 Thank you very much, mister. I don't have a particular question for the presenter but, I want to go back to the AG's office. When I was a City Council member, we had at least one particular, I guess shut down.
2595	Hertzberg	Robert	99	WnmFSvHbO0k	1349	1368	And not engage in the complexities like we had to do in the old days of please send in your ballot, and you'll send a thank you note, and you track them. But, really a way when people for 30 days have an opportunity to vote. And I think, in addition to try to increasing the turnout, I think it will give greater advantage to people without resources in these
2596	De Leon	Kevin	102	N5YEVBe8-2M	509	532	As we, obviously as we know this is a non-ideological, non-partisan issue.  This is an issue to ensure that irrespective of where you live, on what zip code, that you can live in a manner that you feel with good consciousness that your children are in an environment that is safe, that senior citizens are not breathing harmful pollutants, toxins into their lungs.
2597	Monning	Bill	25	V8GPRDBjfho	0	10	And then I think, would it be fair to say that our goal would be to move those for whom we're expending less to move them up as opposed to move those who are receiving more down?
2598	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	7bdBeI04iMY	382	401	to frequency or purpose of these stops. AB 953 is a simple step in the right direction it will not only helped to define racial profiling but for the first-time require Police Department's report on a demographics and reasons for each stop.
2599	Stone	Jeff	26	LrUb6Z3dcdU	1387	1398	I'll guarantee you that that number's going to go up because I think a lot of these people really do want to go out and work but not at the expense of having the fear that they are not going to have their monthly stipend to eat and live. So.
2600	Chavez	Rocky	83	q7AsDi_3G1o	1	15	Any in opposition? Seeing none, going to the dais, any questions from the members? I've got a movement, and I think, Tony, do you second? Got a second. Would you like to close, sir?
2601	Mitchell	Holly	64	gWhhKfvsU08	334	354	Thank you very much for your remarks, Senator Leno. I couldn't agree with you more. I think before we even get into the Prop 98 versus not question, I have to comment on the remarks from finance, which are in fact, consistent with the remarks I've heard from finance since I joined the legislature five years ago.
2602	Liu	Carol	63	nqU0Ufhmqoo	2122	2145	Oh. Okay. Well, Senator McGuire, I really appreciate the work that you have done in this area and I appreciate you taking all the streamlining of the amendments and hopefully, we've covered everything that you're concerned about and we, too, are in support of the bill. So, everybody's a happy camper. Let's call the roll.
2603	Pavley	Fran	104	b4USpkALPiM	445	474	One final comment and then I'll let my two witnesses speak, and I appreciate their attendance. When I carried the Clean Car Law back in 2002, that was really controversial. I mean, remember the Mercury Vaccine bill? You could quadruple whatever that was going on. SUV motorcades parading around the capital, commercials, advertisements, death threat, you name it.
2604	Bonta	Rob	85	HBOX_ihiZFg	254	265	Thank you. Seeing no more for the members of the public coming forward to make public comment. Want to open it up to members of the committee for any closing remarks. Assemblymember Bonilla?
2605	Gomez	Jimmy	80	xuTeMXcZRA0	421	445	But, I do agree that there's a potential to solve this issue and to kind of come to an agreement. We're not saying that it's going to be completely - we're not saying that there's no light at the end of the tunnel, but the processes that it does go on suspense because it does have ongoing cost.
2606	Weber	Shirley	44	0KEfgNXXt_I	608	628	and all the folks who felt they were winners and losers every time we drew a boundary. If all of those people came to Sacramento, and my Legislator wrote a law about everybody, them putting people in places with no regards for my budget, my school sizes, my enrollment issues, I'd feel as a School Board Member, "Why am I here?"
2607	Stone	Jeff	26	npLG8Ena6eQ	678	695	Can you imagine the experience of family witnessing the suffering of that patient. His death painless? Well, we don't know the answer to that because nobody's ever been able to come back and tell us. The problem in determining whether a person suffers with any deadly drug that has killed them is that, again, they can't tell us.
2608	Stone	Mark	20	TPSat3Z_tD4	1208	1221	So, the motion is do pass as amended to housing community-development I'll take that as a motion, is there a second? There is a second. Thank you, comments? Ms, Lopez you may close
2609	Hueso	Ben	48	j_YjnTPR-gU	2284	2300	Cause we have those in print, and the authors promise to work with the committee, and to work with Senator McGuire on establishing the effective date, 17 or 18. That's okay, we'll call the vote. Madam Clerk?
2610	Bonta	Rob	85	ok4qN3L6USs	661	678	Where student need is the highest, schools would also begin to offer breakfast free of charge to all students. To protect local decision making and provide local control, AB 1240 empowers schools and school districts to choose the best method of serving breakfast after the bell on their campuses.
2611	Williams	Das	12	ch3qK2_FbyA	1489	1520	all the service areas to make progress. Frankly, if you included a hydro, one utility would have to do no more, while the other ones would have to do much more. And so, that's sort of the question of whether you would want to make the headway that unequal from the perspective of making all the other utilities except for one do more work and that one utility do none.
2612	Williams	Das	12	ch3qK2_FbyA	1470	1489	Well, as, you know, I was not here and neither you when that the original statute was passed. So, there are various arguments about whether to procure and include it or not. At the very end is, it has not been included yet, partially because we want
2613	Irwin	Jacqui	16	RjCFlLoNauk	136	161	My district is also home to a top marksman, National Guard Staff Sargeant Leif Devomark. Earlier this month, four infantrymen from the California National Guard proved themselves as the army's elite marksmen, when they brought home the top prize is the US Army's Small Arms Championship this weekend. Though, we're very excited to announce that from Ventura County.
2614	De Leon	Kevin	102	GC6hApRO4Yg	1786	1808	I don't have the agreement in front of me right now so I can't answer that question, but I do know that there has been a resolution that was moved by Senator Ricardo Lara on the issue of human rights violations in Mexico.
2615	Hill	Jerry	66	XrOqCob7jCo	1272	1285	Since the majority of healthcare providers are using electronic medical records, the communication will be as easy as a click of a button. Recent amendments have removed the opposition of several groups including Walgreens, CVS pharmacists and retailers.
2616	Mitchell	Holly	64	F-LiWOGboCo	574	597	We know we have the resources. We know the policies that it will take to do it. So as the age old adage is, either go big or go home. It's the intention and work of this select committee to engage the general public and legislators in this conversation so that we're clear about what our path should be to reduce poverty and end deep poverty.
2617	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	2D0v6cuDbfE	1550	1568	It's a legitimate effort to give people who otherwise won't have access, access to what you and I have and so I thank you for bringing this bill because what it's going to do is it's gonna let small business and not the big guys, they know exactly what's happening,
2618	Hernandez	Roger	37	NNzDQCiG5UU	2140	2155	Thank you, Mr. Speaker. As chair of the Assembly Committee of Labor and Employment, I too rise in adjournment in memory Bob Morals. As director of teamsters solid waste division, Bob was instrumental in improving the lives of thousands of workers in the solid waste industry, both through legislative efforts and the bargaining end at the bargaining table,
2619	Medina	Jose	81	8ZmrJUXXU4k	629	650	So thank you to the author for that. But, I hear two things. I hear the bill saying, and it's in the text in the bill. That there are employees doing the job that UC employees are doing.
2620	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	2D0v6cuDbfE	1568	1578	it's gonna let the small business know that they're in violation and that they need to get this kind of assistance to correct that so that people comply with the ADA.
2621	Wood	Jim	72	FR-GoqeWDgw	1197	1206	No, I'm just gonna say I wanna have, we need about five minutes, and I know you've got a lot of information here. We'll make sure all this is up on superb access. But I apologize, we're sorry. Thank you.
2622	Williams	Das	12	9zx01qulT20	296	316	And, because of the sometimes case where their attorney has to be a county employee, and may not have the exact same interests as the county at a given moment. With me today is the sponsor of the bill, Board Chairman of the Ventura County retirement system.
2623	Williams	Das	12	gRicLj3q_0M	92	126	So I just think it is a practical decision to allow the utilities to go after the below code savings, since at this point, that's the majority of the energy efficiency savings that's out there. And the cheapest to get for the right pair. Existing data shows that savings potential for bringing a building to current code standards are higher, because we've already gone after the above code, than potential savings from above code only programs.
2624	Pan	Richard	96	mTcFXIImlIA	496	509	And, these findings, they're also supported by the World Health Organization, the European Union, Centers for Disease Control, the American Medical Association, and other leading medical, scientific, and public health organizations in the Unites States and across the world.
2625	Quirk	Bill	23	jKVkIx_af_k	85	98	Remember, if we want to reduce petroleum by 50%, we need things that are less than 50% in terms of the generation, and that's the point of calling these particular items out.
2626	Olsen	Kristin	15	jj5fwuuTvrg	474	484	would no longer be illegal in California, and then various cities and counties could go in as they deem appropriate if they deem appropriate, and put additional requirements on their use in their local communities
2627	Hernandez	Ed	103	wHx-nZg7Thw	14	34	Yes, I do. Thank you again, Madam Chair, Members. I'm here to present SB 425 relating to career technical education. You know this issue was brought to me in a district by the East San Gabriel Valley ROP, but impacts career technical programs throughout the entire State of California.
2628	De Leon	Kevin	102	aItBzVMycEU	1806	1837	In fact if you notice in the details of the analysis, whether it's Republican or Democrat, the I-owe-you's that being Pacific Gas and Electric, Southern California Edison, as well San Diego Gas and Electric, are not in opposition to 350. They have taken a neutral position, in fact I'm not a position to share the information. They will share it on their own, but in fact, a few of the I-owe-you's are well underway to reaching the 33%, not at 2020.
2629	Galgiani	Cathleen	95	2D0v6cuDbfE	1443	1458	I'd like to thank the author and I'm pleased to be a coauthor with you on this. I think it'll go a long way to really actually changing the problem because what we've seen in my area for a number of years now is that businesses are hit up not just the business itself but the property owners.
2630	Roth	Richard	106	cRT-vVNBfAE	1347	1356	Well, I assume they're not being carried on our wall of debt. But, do you know whether or not the monies are being carried on the books of the counties involved, for example?
2631	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	KLz991S1PxQ	733	742	So my question is, you think something like that would be helpful? Because all the programs in the world you can have. But if you don't have the will to do it, it will be very problematic.
2632	Monning	Bill	25	I17DTXkdVm0	1739	1765	48% of foster youths are given antidepressants that have an FDA black box warning for use by children. We the State of California assume the role of the parent for foster youth. It is the job of the legislature to address the problem for a voice that does not often get heard. SB 253 seeks to address this issue, respectfully asks for your aye vote at the appropriate time.
2633	Lara	Ricardo	107	u9WQRBoV7yg	2193	2212	Members, also let's welcome former Assembly Member from the city by the bay, Fiona Ma who's in the back of the chamber. Let's give her a nice round of applause and welcome her to the state senate. Senator Block.
2634	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	UpjsW9YiW28	2046	2066	Okay, so I just wanna make sure we're all on the same page here, with this. Anyone else in opposition? So, my understanding is that this bill with the amendments will require there be training, maintenance and accountability. Am I wrong in that?
2635	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	HccZsvAseDo	1259	1265	Thank you, Mr speaker. On behalf of the California Legislative Black Caucus we, stand in strong support with our API brothers and sisters of ACR 19. Many CLBC members have had the pleasure of participating in many Asian-American and Pacific Islander cultural events.
2636	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	0KEfgNXXt_I	808	839	Thank you. Question: is Miss Honig here? I believe from Fullerton? The Board President who came up and spoke? Could you come forward, please? It's just a quick question. Would you be willing to meet with these folks to discuss the issue?
2637	Beall	Jim	92	8m8Es5iF3dE	1704	1721	That's not land use that's a business, that's different than, business license is different than land use. It, it's acknowledgement that your conducting a business in a community and that you are gonna follow, abide by the laws related to conducting business in that community.
2638	Mullin	Kevin	31	kmplgTQ8GXM	1553	1570	All members vote who desire to vote, all members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote, clerk will close the roll tally the vote. Ayes 46, Nos 25 measure passes, file items 168 through 170 pass and retain.
2639	Hueso	Ben	48	r2CpJ7yeI28	1543	1578	Thank you. I mean, this bill is complete. I don't think it has received a consensus in the public, and I don't think any bill ever does that, but we've had a chance to weigh in and give some suggestions that we believe can strengthen the bill. This bill still has to advance forward to environmental quality Committee and appropriations and the Senate Floor, and at any time in the process, I as a Chair reserve the right to bring this bill back to address any changes that can be brought up in that process.
2640	Maienschein	Brian	84	OqtPmd4MeNE	1841	1859	Thank you very much Mr. Chairman. Mr. Nazarian I want to thank you for bringing this bill. I, I do intend to support it today, but I did, I, my understanding is your office has been working closely with the opponents on a number of these amendments, and, and, just would you know, give you an opportunity to, to comment that, I,
2641	Nguyen	Janet	65	gDPCmEU7pmg	817	844	I have two more questions. One is, if I recall correctly, RDA in the past always had to be a deficit to be able to exist. So that's why this city, they always owe city money. One other thing when I found out about that, I said, that doesn't help a city if you don't start paying back the city the money, right? Into the general fund.
2642	Roth	Richard	106	tTnQ_O5DRYE	1115	1129	And is the point that anything above the 130, 032 dollars at the bottom in red, is subject to scrutiny? Which would include several agencies, including the controller's office.
2643	Block	Marty	59	qOa-rMs90gw	481	494	 Yeah. Thank you, Senator Allen. It is sometimes hard to take votes that are contrary to what we may support in the long term, just to get a better short term discussion of the items.
2644	Jones	Brian	42	7UN1Ta_jlck	458	479	he's been asleep since lunch time. And just based on his recommendation of being thoughtful, and based on the questions on the floor today that I don't think he's accurately answered, I would recommend that we all be thoughtful and think about this bill some more and send it back to Committee so that we can think on it some more. Thank you.
2645	Nguyen	Janet	65	XBK8TgfRp6Y	572	595	You get to use these shampoo and some of the common goods in the store, but you pay a monthly rent for that place, $500 or $1,000, usually, on average. In the nail salon, the problem you have is this. Some of them consider themselves as a 1099, and they get paid 1099, then they want to be 1099,
2646	Nguyen	Janet	65	XBK8TgfRp6Y	595	617	because most of their money comes from, at the end of the day, is after hours or the weekend. It's not during the weekdays because most of us ladies do work, and so we're not going there getting our nails done at this hour, right. It's usually after hours or on the weekend. And so what happened, though, is that they don't pay a rent for that one station.
2647	Thurmond	Tony	4	MO4QFekCxFk	803	820	I thank you I wanna thank you all for, for bringing this in my community. 50% of the kids in the city where I live are considered obese. 50% of the kids of color, I live in Richmond, 50% of the kids who live in Berkeley. 50% of the kids of color in Berkeley are considered obese.
2648	Gomez	Jimmy	80	u7ADTTDLP7s	176	195	The current wage replacement rate is just too low for anybody to take the time off. Because if they're already living paycheck to paycheck on 100% of their salary, what makes us think that they're actually going to take the time off and live on 50% of their paycheck?
2649	Weber	Shirley	44	BvL-PHidNXM	231	243	And so that's why this, as well as a few other items, are in there, because that's one of the major complaints I hear when I go out and do my budget presentations and who shows up are the elderly, the seniors who show up.
2650	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	FVQ4YG_BqFE	736	764	20,000 at least that found their way into the ocean into the coast off our shoreline. So, what can we do about this? Well, first, we can start by not re-inventing the wheel. In the wake of the Exxon-Valdez spill, a very effective program was created for Prince William Sound that enables local fishing vessels and crews to immediately respond to oil spills.
2651	Beall	Jim	92	C-wEOGkVqSc	36	68	Go out of the room, so we can hear testimony, because we have kind of a small room with a lot of people in it. So we're going to be respectful. And today we are having our first meeting. We have on the agenda several items. Three of the items are on the consent calendar. This is: SB 241, Senator Bates, item 3.  It's on the consent calendar.
2652	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	0uNprUHid34	1115	1138	So I want to thank you for bringing this forward. Having served in a capacity much like OCA's in the past it's amazing to me that cities and counties and districts that decide they want to outsource public services because of a claim of reducing costs somehow want to increase the costs for negotiating with their own employees.
2653	Frazier	Jim	114	Nk0Tcdx-e7s	1055	1095	Thank you so much. Any other? Mr. Palotey did you have something to say? So looks like we have no remaining questions. And I wanna thank the panel again for your informative information, it was really helpful today. To the members of the committee, as you can see, we have our work cut out for us. I think the Governor has told us that the challenge is 5.7 billion, and I think we need to get as close to that amount of money as we can. And I'm looking forward to working with each and every one of you to make that happen this year. And I'm confident we can get there. Because we have to go big or go home. This is the year. So thank you so very much for your attention, and we are adjourned.
2654	Cooley	Ken	45	CToLtc1eO8I	1197	1217	So that was actually a good line of inquiry on my part to understand what they're doing. And it just seemed to me, I've been having this conversation with my colleagues in another area where, what we know is that we have expertise in these public agencies which have been cultivated by the expenditure tax dollars overtime.
2655	Hueso	Ben	48	tINh4PHsxqM	931	944	This bill doesn't necessitate that one has to operate one one way or another, but there's flexibility. In allowing those companies that do operate as independent contractors to actually exist in California.
2656	Roth	Richard	106	Q0YUSKbr_v0	17	38	We need to move people from seeking routine medical care in emergency rooms and get them to clinics. And we need to make sure that those who need more intensive types of care certainly have the resources to do that. I'm not unmindful of the cost issue here but I think it's an important issue that we need to solve,
2657	Beall	Jim	92	D-fVk6CkUDE	920	932	Also, when I was a planner for the city of Santa Cruz, we did a seismic safety plan for the city to get property upgraded, and we didn't have an incentive.
2658	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	qjDm_sZ-lfo	473	495	However, it is still under the authority, I think we heard from the LA District Attorney's office, the City Attorney's offices, it's still subject to criminal litigation until or unless we can work out the role of the State Bar in that. I think that it's always going to not satisfy our desire to come down hard on these folks.
2659	Hernandez	Roger	37	eYvHQ6iO6CE	1732	1750	The gap which exists across our state in service areas means that transport times could range from minutes to hours, which could be the difference of life or death for a person. It is important that we, as a state, are prepared with an organized trauma system ready to give seamless and effective care of patients across county boundaries.
2660	Block	Marty	59	QT-me5fBwnI	685	699	As a result in our recommendations, you'll see that we are rejecting the Basic Skills Proposal. Not because we don't believe in the importance of this basic skills work, and again inviting members of the public to speak to that.
2661	Roth	Richard	106	k_l5daYZc00	291	316	So it seems to me, not to belabor this, So I'll be quick. Mister Chair. That if the Governor's proposal is a proposal that flies there needs to be a piece of it that is provided. Where you provide assistance to districts that really the have not districts. To be able to get into the game and swing the bat is my only comment. Thank you Mr. Chair.
2662	Hancock	Loni	98	vEySB-JPx9Q	475	489	Now we know, criminal justice research tells us this is not a good way to get reliable information, that you can't get out of machine name the names of people we're going to put in. That has now changed.
2663	Roth	Richard	106	Ty0_iZ3tnjo	404	447	Two, as a condition of receiving relief from the minimum statutory damage, under the provisions as proposed, a business must correct all violations at the facility, not just those noted in the CASp inspection reports. So, for example, if you hire a CASp, and you spend the money necessary to do so, and you take the time to facilitate the CASp inspection, and the CASp inspector provides you with a written report, and it lists ten violations that needed to be corrected, and you correct all ten, if someone then visits your facility, and there is an 11th violation that's not in the report that you have not corrected, under the current language, you lose the opportunity to secure the benefit of eliminating the minimum statutory damages in any litigation.
2664	Hill	Jerry	66	ZMZhi0vPE74	270	278	I just wanted to say thank you to the opposition for the -- I see the fishing lure I lost 40 years ago in the Mokelumne River, so thank you for having that here.
2665	De Leon	Kevin	102	pmq1wDNXXkw	984	1004	Therefore, when you actually, it's not a good feel, sort of oblis, oblage kinda like, we feel good because we're helping the poor. This actually makes sense because these are folks who are actually meeting higher amounts of CO2 in some cases because of the cars that they're driving.
2666	Hill	Jerry	66	mxsKkg9J8wc	1172	1193	I see. Very good. Thank you. Other witnesses in support? I seeing none, witnesses in opposition. Questions from the committee? Seeing or hearing none. Is there a motion? Senator Hernandez, a motion to move the bill to the Appropriations Committee. Would you like to close Assemblymember Frazier?
2667	Moorlach	John	4657	8_h1Rf31Czc	1187	1199	For the Senator, you, I think you answered my question, but it exempts state and local government buildings, and you said the state is covered through an Executive Order. Does that apply to county and city buildings as well, this Executive Order?
2668	Leno	Mark	60	MPEe2Ccro74	1584	1628	There are safeguards and safeguards added. And, we've had the opportunity to learn from the experience of the State of Oregon. And, by far those fears are realized. But, that didn't stop us from doing even more in this bill. I don't want to miss an opportunity to recognize that this is an idea not only whose time has come, but, an idea that has been worked out in this Legislature for well over a decade.
2669	Huff	Bob	105	j_gGP70jLkM	559	577	But in 2006, Reagan was inducted into California hall of fame. His statue is now in statuary hall in Congress thanks to action we took some years ago. It's what you all remember, our great Governor and President and please remember him tomorrow February 6th. Thank you.
2670	Leno	Mark	60	RuFiLUXgjss	927	951	Even the most brilliant attorneys in the land use counsel for good reason. So I appreciate the position that a defendant is in should this become law because there would be a suggestion to the jury that there is some guilt here and one needs to be presumed innocent
2671	Brown	Cheryl	13	yFQH5D8dVds	329	350	Thank you.  I know we want to move ahead on finishing this, but I wanted to just come back to the disabled veterans and the reason is because I've asked my staff to kind of go through and tell me what the issues with, the specific issues were, with the disabled vet that has been going to my office.
2672	Alejo	Luis	9	_skeu0yft7s	1785	1797	First of all, I just want to take an opportunity to also recognize these farm workers who came from Fresno, Modesto, and former farm workers who got on a bus or in a car and drove eight hours from Los Angeles to be here.
2673	Leno	Mark	60	svWS1LjAu9c	1639	1667	I think a good place to start might be to ask the Department of Finance if we could go back to page six of the LAO's paper. These are not insignificant shortcomings and I want you to have the opportunity to respond, to say you're working on it, you know, you think they are in place. Whatever, and we could take them point-by-point.
2674	Bigelow	Frank	91	-Nb5xJu_Rq4	1006	1030	Ms. Garcia, first of all, I'd like to applaud for what you're doing today. As the, probably the only member sitting here that's an EMT. Been a fireman for 40 years, and seen far too many accidents that I would love to forget and wipe from my memory banks of many horrific accidents. In particular the worst are those where children are effected.
2675	Quirk	Bill	23	AtEtvEwPM9c	494	516	We could do that if we had people who were gonna buy it and right now the difficulty is because it's never been scaled up the prices are high, but if we have a buyer, the state, things can be scaled up and at that point they become cheaper and they become available to a larger group.
2676	Gallagher	James	108	-OpN4Uo7BxE	839	850	So we're sort of saying that jurisdictions are guilty before they are proven innocent, and we are putting a burden on them to prove a negative that they don't have discriminatory practices.
2677	Bigelow	Frank	91	2b3SgDbb8jI	67	77	It has a do pass recommendation. Do you have any witnesses in support? Any in opposition? Any questions for members? Seeing known, I believe this is out on an A role call.
2678	Nazarian	Adrin	36	KzIfF7fCyGE	147	169	Currently, charter party carriers are required to register each of their vehicles and display an identifying symbol on those vehicles in order to receive an operating permit from the PUC. Similarly, to increase transparency, accountability and safety, AB 24 will require TNCs to comply with these same requirements.
2679	Patterson	Jim	119	QFffajW9pIQ	1625	1636	At that point, before filing its appeal or as a condition of filing of its appeal with the court, it would have to post the bond. Did I did I answer your question?
2680	Patterson	Jim	119	P6cBeme--dw	980	1001	Thank you Mr Speaker and members. I rise to oppose this bill and I want to at least visit the procedural question. I know that there has been a ruling with respect to the fact that it's appropriate here. Allow me to disagree.
2681	Bates	Pat	58	j_gGP70jLkM	878	895	Item three and four, Senator Fuller will be pass on file. Item five Senator Huff will be pass on file. Item six Senator Fuller will be pass on file. Item seven SCR13 Senator Jackson.
2682	Burke	Autumn	6	P6cBeme--dw	942	961	People should have choices. And like my colleague from Lakewood said, I think that that's the root of what this means. Life matters and what we all do here in this building prove that every day. What we do with our time truly matters on this earth.
2683	Hill	Jerry	66	ilwRLhZLtAc	1625	1648	Those individuals can continue to go about their business without suspension, if I understand it correctly. You don't generally suspend someone or put their license on hold or do something that gets them out of the field for that position during that period of time.
2684	Hertzberg	Robert	99	1-lHMg2FsZ4	748	758	the introduction he did is that we want to encourage people to come to California to buy it and take delivery here, cuz if they take delivery here there'll be collateral economic benefits to them showing up to California.
2685	Mitchell	Holly	64	4YUeKJp9AQ0	1384	1401	Thank you, sir, let's begin with SB 23, if that is okay with you? I'd like to note that SB 23 is a measure that seeks to remove the discriminatory and ineffective family cap in place for families receiving CalWORKS. Very briefly, just to give us some context about the bill.
2686	Olsen	Kristin	15	G4RiUnTMom4	132	147	Parents cannot fully and effectively advocate for their children during the LCAP process if they don't have clear information about how and how often their teachers and principles are being evaluated, or which schools are receiving what level of funding for what programs.
2687	Leno	Mark	60	WsNNww2cgqU	1868	1889	Madam Chair, just to back you up on your last statement. We've heard from the sponsor of the bill that the intent was to allow for some discretion and determination by the judicial council. The costs, I'm sure, were a part of that consideration.
2688	Wood	Jim	72	2gM15KHmKpo	1248	1265	So I recognize that the addition of the guidelines that seek to regulate the actual cultivation of marijuana may create some conflicts with other pending legislation. But you have to start somewhere and I will commit to you that I will continue to work to resolve the differences working with the other authors, and I respectfully ask for you aye vote.
2689	Block	Marty	59	SvIBnS8_PpY	1845	1859	The earlier we in Sub One can know about what that committees doing, the earlier we can kind of target our efforts to be compatible. So appreciate any updates. LAO any comment?
2690	Mitchell	Holly	64	o6dY6yB1_H8	168	182	This bill will clarify that the document is a vital one under current California law ensuring that the document is translated into languages that are representative and accessible to members of our diverse California communities is our ultimate responsibility.
2691	Jones	Brian	42	R3SMzNAvRKs	1257	1275	Another thing about this bill I don't understand is why is the CTA and the proponents of the bill so afraid of the profit aspect of it? I think we can all agree that the CTA and other special-interest organizations tied up in the education system make a tidy profit themself
2692	Grove	Shannon	77	G-cKeAHj51U	2586	2594	I thank you very much, and I do applaud the author for bringing this forward. And I do know that there were serious issues in the past and that we may face them now.
2693	Allen	Benjamin	70	gHROOmcULrM	230	244	This seeks to offer significant benefits to California. First, replacing just 10% of California's natural gas with renewable gas will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 12.6 million metric tons from fossil fuel displacement alone.
2694	Vidak	Andy	56	0yf1SfBcDOs	2234	2243	We have rail that needs to go from Bakersfield to Los Angeles. I think that would be fantastic. That would be good for you folks. But I just wanna take care of people.
2695	Rendon	Anthony	120	mHQI7IJaeKM	81	106	The Conservancy has been able to develop affordable facilities thanks to these fees and other sources granting over $9 million to develop thirteen affordable accommodations along the coast. But there's still quite a bit to be done. There's close to $10 million in in-liu fees that have been spent yet, so we need to work together to prioritize that money and future money to retain existing facilities and ensure that new ones are financially accessible to all Californians. Excuse me.
2696	Mitchell	Holly	64	iQQbLXy8ddc	93	110	A courtroom should not be the place where a child is forced to face a defendant for which the child was a witness to a violent crime solely to draw on an emotional reaction from the child to play to the grand jury's sensitivities. With me today is someone who should be familiar to many of you.
2697	Wieckowski	Bob	55	k4GcCA0Jbo4	1001	1018	This bill would add post-secondary education institutions to the list of places where drivers with restricted license are permitted to drive to. This change would only apply to individuals whose licenses have been restricted due for the la, due to the lack of insurance.
2698	Gomez	Jimmy	80	u7ADTTDLP7s	91	112	Although the program has benefited millions of Californians, the way that it is currently structured Is fundamentally inequitable because those at the lowest rungs of the economic ladder can never afford to take six weeks off at 55% of their wage. And they don't have the necessary job protection to have the confidence to take their leave and have their job when they actually come back.
2699	Nielsen	Jim	68	rXdeWNKFzAk	2	20	Senate Committee on Veteran's Affairs. I'm Jim Nielson, I have the privilege this year of serving as the Chair of this Committee and we appreciate your being here today. I'm gonna give some brief opening remarks, I wanna introduce the Vice Chairman and the other members will come.
2700	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	C-QK6WD4V0E	40	70	So I notice can be out order, this is our first meeting so I'm human, I make mistakes, so on issue number one, where there was public comment, so I want to make sure that individuals who wanted to talk about issue number one were able to come and comment, and they would do issue number two, but on Director Beers' comments, please come say your name.
2701	Gray	Adam	27	TgDKGcmi03Q	414	430	Thank you senator. I'm pleased to join Senator Jackson in welcoming everyone to the joint informational hearing of the Assembly Select Committee on Rail and the Senate Select Committee on Passenger Rail.
2702	Liu	Carol	63	t4_AyYAahhk	144	177	And a lot of this basic skills work has been basically the responsibility of community colleges, and they have, I mean, I remember Senator Scott as a College President complaining about the change of mission, so to speak, with the community colleges as, instead of being a transfer institution, or a CTE, or you know in the third leg, was that they become more basically involved with basic skills.
2703	Bonilla	Susan	3	JxGEdNdnkQ4	57	72	and school safety planning, that money went away when we did the local control funding formula. We lost that special category of funds. And so this is a bill that says that we would develop a license plate in partnership with the Department of Education.
2704	Hertzberg	Robert	99	UpjsW9YiW28	46	65	But what you got here, and that worries me because I've lived this in the last dozen years that I've traveled the world, is I have seen in so many instances, where people with the greatest intentions, they just don't make a product. So the question is, if it's a diode in something, I know we talked about the 5%, which I wanna get to,
2705	De Leon	Kevin	102	Kc7udwSIfNk	1628	1655	Thank you very much, Madame President. You have done a wonderful job today. We have done a tremendous amount of bills. Our Senate majority leader has already articulated the number. I think that if we stay focused tomorrow, we're going to have several committees off-the-floor tomorrow dealing with some stragglers that will be contingent on waivers.
2706	Hueso	Ben	48	4lx0MqjDD6Q	166	181	Okay, we want to show how easy it is to use. We have lots. I think we've peeled off our support. We worked with opponents on this bill to address their concerns, and I think at this time there is no opposition. But we'll hear from-
2707	Stone	Jeff	26	uk0vIxtVZmg	25	35	And I'm going to opine hopefully with accuracy that most of us have not had the opportunity yet to even read this bill from one side to the other.
2708	Mitchell	Holly	64	ew8AvQDfJuQ	675	684	So there's another way of looking at it that, contracted with nonprofit organizations to do this work, could be saving us more than it would cost us if, like other states,
2709	Patterson	Jim	119	KQICDVGfqPQ	809	839	Thank you very much Mr. speaker and members. Today I'm asking us to respectfully adjourn in the memory of George Sheklian. Giorgio, Armenian, but grew up with his family in Argentina. He left school at eight years of age to help his family make ends meet. He started by shining shoes. At 30, he immigrated to the United States with $8 in his pocket and he opened his business, which was a shoe repair and design store a year later in Fresno, California.
2710	Ting	Philip	30	sA6uJxeRGKk	436	456	the continental US that would actually charge that fee so we decided to make sure that we codify legislation that all bridges in this state will not be allowed to charge pedestrians and walkers especially in light of our really goals to reduce our petroleum usage and make sure that we ensure a healthier lifestyle and reduce our greenhouse gases. We think
2711	Mitchell	Holly	64	9Cq9HzC0GV0	975	998	And I think finally for you, Director, what's on the horizon from your perspective? What's the major, I think, issue that you look forward to tackling as the new Director to really improve safety, improve the life experience of those within your charge, as well as the employees under your direction?
2712	Fuller	Jean	49	rD0VjcELenc	1095	1100	Last year, I was honored to acknowledge top-ranking student athletes from the California High School Rodeo Association in this chamber. When we met after the session they proposed this bill idea. These young men and women spent countless hours practicing and preparing for events as well as caring for their horses on a daily basis.
2713	Hancock	Loni	98	slpYLwAvmtM	707	747	Now there's been great interest in training. Much of this has been controversial and provoked a great deal of discussion and thought. Rather than eliminating the 32 post positions as proposed in the Governor's January budget. The May revision requests a 5.2 million reduction, which reduces administrative costs, increases the reduction of non-mandated training courses by 1.9 million.
2714	Garcia	Cristina	112	0lsNxjB7bP8	1959	1971	As I will say that as a consumer we expect a certain experience and we expect certain data to be used to constantly improve that experience. And so narrowing this to such a limited amount, because it applies to a different business model,
2715	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	yhx1NvxzAgA	900	923	And yet, given what we recognize with some of the egregious behaviors of trafficking and so forth, we want to be able to provide an opportunity for someone to come into a court of law, to have their day in court. Although I must suggest that because of delay, frequently it's difficult to get that justice because memories have faded.
2716	Wieckowski	Bob	55	xJqN87zbSDI	876	895	What happens if the court, the federal court, has sliced up the pie, so to speak, and then the person files bankruptcy, it's a subsequent action? They're responsive for this, but the action comes later. Are you able to go back and reapportion it or is that a cost that's going to be absorbed by the state?
2717	Gallagher	James	108	x4d8DYXm7og	271	282	You may proceed, Mr. Gallagher. Well, with that in mind, I think this bill is worthy of support and as the assistant floor leader I encourage our whips to whip this bill and whip it, whip it good.
2718	Calderon	Ian Charles	115	nkFf3IHgULc	26	45	Afternoon, Madame Chair and members. Today I'm bringing AB 856. A measure which will close a loop hole in existing law to clarify that it is trespassing for paparazzi to fly a drone over private property. Last August, I co-authored a joint oversight hearing of the assembly committee on entertainment, sports, tourism, internet, media.
2719	Thurmond	Tony	4	YGvsvPIzjxQ	879	900	People who had specialized training to help us have the conversation so that there wasn't more harm done by well-intentioned folks trying to lead the conversation but bringing in, you know, we brought in a group. Our local women against rape organization, actually has a program geared specifically for talking about violence with young men.
2720	Stone	Jeff	26	pIm79elnbMQ	1636	1656	to my 59 to 77. Why are they getting paid more money than we're getting paid, when we're doing the same work and we have a higher rent to pay than we do down there? So, these are questions, I think, are appropriate to be asked when the taxpayers are on the hook for paying this money. Like I said, if Los Angeles wants to give them $200,000, that's between them and
2721	Pan	Richard	96	gB_BkuvgLvc	669	705	So I would say, first of all, there is no restrictions in both current law or in the bill that prevents a physician from doing that. There are none. So now what we're doing is you're, my concern is, we're now adding language to tell a physician to do something that may not be necessary. If a physician feels that a test is necessary to perform, to be sure that a vaccine is safe, they can perform that test. If a physician feels that there's a genetic association in a sibling, a cousin, some other relative, it's not safe for vaccine, they can provide medical exemption for that vaccine.
2722	Stone	Jeff	26	pIm79elnbMQ	1656	1667	the nurses and the constituents in LA County to deal with their Board of Supervisors. But we shouldn't, the taxpayers of the State of California, be supplanting that contract. They should be paying the difference.
2723	Allen	Benjamin	70	UOAgtw9idpM	809	828	and recreation and conservation that the National Park Service puts toward this work. And they're beautiful pieces of property, I mean, you know, Carrizo Plain and the Southern Sierras, that southern sequoia section that's just south of Sequoia National Park. And I'm so glad to have them receive
2724	Pavley	Fran	104	knpBhgRlo8Q	698	714	I was curious about something. First of all, it has been brought to our attention, and there's been some desire by some of the many non-profits and other stakeholders that they've been a greater part of the discussion.
2725	Ting	Philip	30	0xUa-SoTZfU	89	105	Cuz I guess that's what we've been trying to figure out from a legal perspective, you have very, I mean if you look at the broadest interpretation, Like Justice Thomas' interpretation which is once you create a school once you've create a religion.
2726	Stone	Mark	20	RFWwgE7ubok	2218	2234	Thank you. So that motion is due pass as amended to Appropriations, that. Mr. Gallagher is seconding it. Oh. Mr. Wagner seconded. Sorry, I thought I heard something. Mr. Gallagher.
2727	Hertzberg	Robert	99	miQ0Fm1d12I	21	45	Ladies and gentlemen, if you're here for that, you can stay for the rest of the presentations. File item number nine, Canella SB 537 has been pulled and lastly file item number twelve, SB 593 by senator McGuire has also been pulled. Let's go, we've got senator Galgiani here, File item number 3, SB 313. The floor is yours.
2728	Pan	Richard	96	CdKj6oLMa4k	1366	1382	Okay. But, What I'm looking for, I realize someone could try to do that. But how do we put it the law to say that the employer has to get there versus saying, "oh they can't. But there's no legal force behind controlling who doesn't"?
2729	Bonta	Rob	85	iq_O5tryJ2s	911	928	Thank you. A quick question for the auditor. The auditor report included some recommendations to set a time frame for closing investigations, and we just heard that the Department didn't agree with that recommendation. Did you have any specific suggestions on how long that time frame should be?
2730	De Leon	Kevin	102	fjQhThyumBs	1146	1159	But I wanna underscore one thing, too and I wanna go back to what I said with Ms. Burke, too. I also wanna be careful. Economic growth is obviously critical, and I agree wholeheartedly.
2731	Chiu	David	7	86lIew9ia6A	1037	1055	And what we have heard from folks is that, when you tie funding to reimbursement of being able to prove when applicants who are being served by organizations have received definitive decisions from the federal administration, with regards to immigration.
2732	Hill	Jerry	66	d6E9NdP26E4	457	474	Thank you Mr. Chair and members. The CDC estimates that at least two million Americans are infected with, and at least 23,000 die, from antibiotic resistant infections each year. There are multiple causes of antibiotic resistance, the overuse and misuse of antibiotics being one of the most prominent.
2733	Wieckowski	Bob	55	jKVkIx_af_k	519	530	We'll keep that open for the absent members. Thank you very much and nice morning. Assembly Member Leno. I mean Levine. Ha ha, AB 157, the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge.
2734	Chau	Ed	116	LP2al6_ixVo	135	158	According to the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, California has six of the most expensive rental markets in the country. Nationwide, rents in 2014 grew the fastest in the San Jose and San Francisco metropolitan areas increasing by 14.4 and 13.5% respectively.
2735	Mitchell	Holly	64	leLv2BAfLGY	1415	1440	Eileen Richey, ARKA. The issue of equal access to services is essential. However, rates for interpreters and translators are a significant barrier. Especially since translators and interpreters that are familiar with our field come under the median rate cap. So, that is a very difficult issue for us, and one that we hope that you would address. Thank you.
2736	Grove	Shannon	77	wK5CwGDTeOM	756	772	Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I too rise in support of this bill and I thank my colleague from Tulare County for bringing this forward. I also applaud my colleague from Salinas for making the comments. I know as a deep connection to Tulare County, but it is true, Porterville does, is ground zero.
2737	Pan	Richard	96	zjh5VKf9m04	188	211	And instead as we're looking at things like retiree health costs, I'm just concerned about how that overall expands. And then, certainly the other piece is that, of course from the state's perspective, whether we have a high-deductible health plan or not, how does that actually effect our overall state cost as well as, of course very importantly, the health of our employees and our retirees.
2738	Wieckowski	Bob	55	H8qQQkSchzo	1579	1593	Right, it's not, it's not everything. I'm not professing that it's everything, but it is an improvement of how the calculation. And again, it's ASHPEG that's going to be ultimately setting these standardization.
2739	Wagner	Donald	88	7KrRcZ9ORsY	1954	1976	What I failed to see in this bill unfortunately is an appreciation of those heartfelt perspectives. This bill is bringing to the legislature and asking us to use very heavy hand of government to force private citizens, our constituents to violate their conscience.
2740	De Leon	Kevin	102	SxRX-lKXiDU	1057	1072	More polluting cars that are larger because of work purposes.  More polluting cars that are larger because of work purposes. They need long hauls. And if we are successful by incentivizing and providing the bundling, and the fact that we will have policy questions before.
2741	Baker	Catharine	74	CD2KiD3xDgY	732	745	And do you know, how many st, what per, either what percentage of students or how many students by number are participants in this program? Just to get a sense of the scope of how much, how many students benefit in comparison to the expenditure.
2742	Stone	Mark	20	leLv2BAfLGY	1107	1129	And obviously, will have much more influence on making sure that this week, that we hopefully will include an appropriate amount of money and go down a parallel path to make sure that at the end, the Governor sees the recommendations and how serious those recommendations are.
2743	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	SCWpb6PxRGE	1566	1589	Because I, I think we don't appreciate the challenges that other people have going through the kinds of day to day routines that, that for most of us we, we can't comprehend. We, we just haven't experienced. And how little consideration we give for the things that we have that, that others don't.
2744	Weber	Shirley	44	U9EPCHTiWm8	1521	1535	I want to thank Senator Mitchell for bringing this forward. And we heard this report at a retreat or meeting the Black Caucus had in silicon valley. And we had read the report, seen the information.
2745	Hancock	Loni	98	zieucXg-cLU	234	258	Lots of things that we all know in our hearts use our energy and are very restorative. Thought we might wanna look at something like that. There are methods of doing this kinda cost benefit analysis that could show that it is very cost effective.
2746	Pavley	Fran	104	-_4-MnSxShM	1767	1792	Thank you. Anyone else? Opposition? I noticed, would like to tell the members this bill has been double referred to environmental quality, allowing time for the author as well as my staff and EQ staff to work on any final resolution on amendments. Senator Stone, any comments from anyone here? Senator Vidak?
2747	Liu	Carol	63	WPX0fE7wHjw	18	43	Madam Chair, members, SB 224 regards the Elderly Parole Program. Last year the Governor created the Elderly Parole Program in partial response to the order issued by the three judge panel in the Plata/Coleman v. Brown. The program allows inmates who are sixty years and older, and have served twenty-five years on their current sentences to be considered for parole.
2748	Bonilla	Susan	3	0JpwnSkUZnE	1532	1546	Well, it is an honor to be here, I apologize for my late arrival. I was stuck presenting bills in multiple committees today as most of us are, thank you so much for taking the time to prepare the information and the presentations.
2749	Gipson	Mike	28	nsdCapqFbmM	114	153	Nearly 40% of the foster youth become homeless and reported estimates that there are over 10,000 homeless college students in California. Yet we know actually, the actual figures are much larger given the number of students who don't identify or are afraid to do so because of social stigma. With that in mind, AB 1228 seeks to expand current law to include homeless youth with an understanding the often overlooked intersection between the two homeless youth and foster youth's population.
2750	Moorlach	John	4657	07ilphfHuEw	1018	1033	There was one of those really great awkward moments so with that colleagues, I think we need to be a little more careful how we negotiate or at least we need to give the administration a little more help in trying to fix the problems.
2751	McGuire	Mike	93	zWP9Ch_UvEs	44	62	As a result, California has some of the oldest polluting buses in the nation. These older buses emit nearly twice as much pollution per mile as a semi truck. In addition, buses manufactured before 1990 can produce as much as six times more particulate matter in nitrogen oxides.
2752	Gipson	Mike	28	nsdCapqFbmM	82	114	 Thank you. Members, current law requires CSUs and requests that the community college and UCs campus provides priority to current and foster youth on campus for housing. Current law also requests that the UCs and the CSUs campuses explores ways of using administration by exempling-- exempling-- I don't know, to help foster youth transition into college.
2753	Wolk	Lois	94	BllaAgaiebY	868	879	3 to 0, those proposals are rejected. Not because we didn't like them but a lot of them need a little bit more work. A little bit more information.
2754	Monning	Bill	25	r81aKKdk2dA	1020	1043	Yeah, and I would just underscore that, as framed, it was a dispute among different potential county behavioral health regional center, the plan, but it wasn't resolved, and the ongoing lack of resolution put the patient at risk and put family members at risk.
2755	McCarty	Kevin	22	gjsHvnVIeLU	1188	1205	As you know, vast research shows that investing in early education pays big dividends. Foremost, this helps address our achievement gap. Helps prevent kids from entering our juvenile justice system, and it helps fight poverty. You know, in this year's state budget, we focused on this issue.
2756	Pan	Richard	96	BQgV9eqQ2Tw	1070	1080	SB 573 will allow the state to open its data in a secure in efficient manner which has the potential to vastly improve our government's efficiency in accountability, and foster economic development.
2757	Wood	Jim	72	9PxlbB74Usg	425	441	In one county there are no providers willing to accept patients. In three of the counties that I represent, only one provider willing to accept new patients, and in Sonoma county the most populous of the five counties that I represent, only nine are willing to accept new children's beneficiaries.
2758	Fuller	Jean	49	oDMixRIfl_Y	687	702	And there were a lot of programs, new programs, the Legislature didn't authorize that were authorized by the CPUC. And so for us, that made a very large problem.
2759	Atkins	Toni	110	4MjmF7EnXtg	82	100	Proposition one passed by voters last November includes $17 million for projects in the river conservancy water shed with projects estimated to take five to ten years to complete. Grantees must be monitored for compliance with grant conditions on capital projects for up to 25 years.
2760	Baker	Catharine	74	DFwwvEWhxJg	1122	1142	Thank you Mr. Chairman. I've received some increase in my district. First of all, thank you Chairman Nichols for joining us today. We've seen increase in concerns in my district, which is East Bay Area, about the safety of filters that are required on a certain diesel vehicles, their exhaust pipes that are model year 2007 or earlier.
2761	Allen	Benjamin	70	xZgWg023k_I	304	317	which is something we're going to be thinking about and talking about as well. We've also been looking a lot the hybrid system that they have in Colorado where every voter is mailed a ballot and then there are voting centers that are open for two weeks before each election
2762	Hancock	Loni	98	B0PWp2aeSfk	1821	1837	I mean, we're really working to bring some of the innovative programs from certain prisons like San Quentin to other prisons and I will say the department's done a fabulous job on giving out those contracts and getting them in the field. I think they're gonna make a difference.
2763	Stone	Jeff	26	N91f_wLf7XI	459	485	Thank you, madam chairman. It seems to me that, maybe I'm wrong, but the 24 month mile moniker was maybe in response to a billion dollars taken out of the program over four years, it was more of a fiscally derived decision rather than a practical decision. Is that fair to say?
2764	Hernandez	Ed	103	JM1ztwrhmks	1494	1509	Your quote was innovative medical medicine loses their patents after a certain period of time. So I would hope that that would continue to evolve into, as we continue our health care discussion.
2765	Brown	Cheryl	13	iq_O5tryJ2s	1099	1146	Thank you. Thank you so much. It's been a robust discussion. It has been very enlightening. And I wanna focus more on you and your department, rather than the nursing homes. I wanna focus on how you do what you do. It seems to me that there seems to be some problem with accountability. First of all you started out telling us how many nursing homes, hospitals, everything that you had. This particular hearing is just about nursing homes. So, there are 1,200, am I right? 1,200 nursing homes? And you focused heavily on Los Angeles. There are how many in Los Angeles?
2766	Holden	Chris	78	mEidzFiLEmY	663	689	So the effects of this legislation are negligible, to the extent that the concurrent enrollment programs continue to perform successfully as studies in California have indicated. The front end costs pressures to expand community college funding to accommodate concurrent enrollment students will be substantially mitigated by the savings realized from reducing the need for, for remediation in the CSUs and UC system.
2767	Roth	Richard	106	tTnQ_O5DRYE	850	887	If that makes sense, and then I assume that there are other items in the report where there's more money or less money that is left on the table that should be used more efficiently. Well, that would be an interesting figure, right, because the total budget's 3 billion, so if the total is 30 million on a 3 billion dollar budget, while we should be obviously sensitive to that and urge the judicial branch to be more efficient, it's somewhat less impactful than if it were 500 million-dollars on another computer project.
2768	Mitchell	Holly	64	j_gGP70jLkM	1155	1181	Thank you very much madam President. I stand today as a member of the California legislative black caucus and as the women's caucus to also recognize the disproportionate number of women of color, african american women unfortunately at the top of the heap, who suffer from various forms of heart disease and the whole point of wear your red dress day is to acknowledge the fact that we simply don't know it
2769	Pan	Richard	96	1ThUxLCsowo	100	126	The apparent reason for refusing to acquire these reports is the UC cannot produce information pursuant to a California Public Records Act request that it does not possess. This is a manipulation of the California Public Records Act and goes against the public interest. To date, UC has invested over 239 million and ten Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Sequoia Capital funds. However, the public does not know the outcome of some of these investments because of this loophole.
2770	Hueso	Ben	48	6K6tNBJxn7k	187	206	That's what I'm-- If you go back to that profit column, that's where I'm having a hard time understanding that if you see one the one hand, you know, the profit column has at about 32 cents of every unit then it spikes up to 117 and 89.
2771	Wood	Jim	72	jDVMk92LYlk	1309	1326	And maybe that's because it was so much easier and cheaper to get tobacco products in the military then it is anywhere else. I love my country, I'd do anything for it. I'd protect it, including going to war myself so that my son wouldn't have to go, who's 19 years old. If I could change the age of military service I'd do that too, but I can't do that.
2772	Thurmond	Tony	4	GV2uLrBMX6U	710	730	She was born in the Philippines to missionary parents and Marietta spent her life in the Oakland and Berkeley area and was a champion for children and families. She helped to integrate the schools in the 60s at Emerson Elementary School in Berkeley and she worked with physically disabled children at the Whitney School.
2773	Gipson	Mike	28	rNW_uEjgPtM	28	44	Thank you very much Madam Chair and Senators. Thank you for giving me this opportunity to present Assembly Bill 709, which seeks to require charter schools to comply with the same transparency and accountability law as traditional schools.
2774	Stone	Mark	20	B4ry1_3tU0U	1287	1302	And regardless of who commits acts against them, this Legislature's been pretty clear so far: we want to be in support of them. So this is, I feel, a very appropriate step for this Legislature to do. It's why my recommendation with the amendments, is to pass out of this Committee.
2775	Wood	Jim	72	Y6AL-ziJQBc	844	860	So in the past, if the institution where the, say not an on-the-job training but an institution that's actually providing the education certified that the person would be graduating and eligible to take the exam. They were allowed to do that before?
2776	Nielsen	Jim	68	U931SFow8w0	1061	1076	I like that latter part, you pay to have them take it. I'd like to, you know, keep track of that. Well, I'm raising some issues that I think are ongoing of concern. And we'd like to pay attention and have that dialogue with you, and we'll be watching after that in the budget.
2777	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	I1DeZTgw_DI	1664	1678	As a legislation has a secular purpose of promoting the family and increasing pay, in no way does it advance or inhibit religion, unless the Chamber's arguing it is their religious principle to force people to work for minimum pay on every day of the year.
2778	Pavley	Fran	104	xvcU4IJP8VQ	556	591	A question out of curiosity. I know some cities, but not all cities have a, a really complete deferred and maintenance program for their local streets  So that we know that keeping up on maintenance is a lot less expensive than letting your roads deteriorate significantly. It seems to me that's part of the discussion or should be part of the solution
2779	Eggman	Susan Talamantes	73	4sq_B6zlasQ	1679	1697	incidents from 1996 to 2012, i84 which involved a fatality among young children was motivated to introduce this bill when I had constituents come to me what triplets and one of the triplets despite everything they had done ...following instructions to keep that child safe one of them was killed by strangulation by a window
2780	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	_4l4q_6Hap0	676	702	Well since 1994, the DMV has been tracking the type of identification used to get a drivers license. And two of those identifications are subject to either falsifying documents or using a birth certificate, a US birth certificate, which shows that you're a citizen, or a US passport, which shows that you're a citizen, and so it's only the information from those individuals that will be forward.
2781	Leyva	Connie	62	MpQ4SGzO7GE	239	250	And I think what the bill says is the address of each residential unit that was offered, so you have to provide that, the total number of nights and the amounts paid for the occupancy.
2782	Chavez	Rocky	83	XXqQ4bkVgnA	844	861	I'm sure a lot of the professors and your business schools are very aware of what we're trying to do here. I have to go to another important meeting but I just want to make this one really, two statements.
2783	Leyva	Connie	62	MpQ4SGzO7GE	250	269	So, going to Senator Ross, some of his questions he's left. But, I think that's something you guys could probably do. I mean, you're a $13 billion company. So you maybe could hire a few people that could input that dat, that data. It's only, it's asking for the address. It's not asking for people's name or any sensitive information.
2784	Hall	Isadore	1	fRdlkKyIGD4	662	688	Well, the Chair's recommended do pass with the current amendment. So the Chair's not gonna be requiring the bill to come back to the committee. If there are additional amendments, those amendments will be considered as it moves forward to the next committee, and then to the floor. I hope I gave you the short answer.
2785	Hertzberg	Robert	99	hp2WTRF5hkg	551	575	In this situation, we have a line of 845 customers of 6,100 gigawatt hours, back in 2012. All I'm saying to you is let's, let's do exactly what you say. Let's open it up, right? And let's not be crazy, because that would be problematic. And let's test whether those guys have left, maybe they got out of business. Maybe they went off to Hawaii. Who knows what they are, if they're still real, because they're old waiting lists. Let's create a 6-month window.
2786	McGuire	Mike	93	JX8xAEiw8s4	200	251	Since 2006, rates of psych med's has continued to climb, 9% total foster care population in 2006, fast forward it to today, we're at 15%. With very little state oversight or action taken. Even more significant, we've seen a fairly dramatic decrease in the number of foster youth in the system over the past decade, and I want to thank the department for the work on this. But California's reliance on psych meds, have increased even though the population has dropped. And it's simply not acceptable. That 72% of the total $226 million spent out of Medi-Cal for psych drugs over the last decade were spent on foster kids. 72% of $226 million.
2787	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	JuhOyjEkHd4	46	66	And it would be helpful to to hear more about how Metrolink is on track to be the first passenger carrier in the country to have this system on its entire or to have this control in its entire system. And so our, let's hear for the first and then go on to Shamus Murphy.
2788	Stone	Jeff	26	c8SqTr4brJk	39	54	One, when we do the bid specs, we're not competent in asking for what we need for a one size fit all program or we're not managing it well, or we're not holding the contractor accountable.
2789	Gallagher	James	108	-Nb5xJu_Rq4	404	427	Yeah, you know, in the bill right now, there's a provision that would waive the reporting requirements, if there is a project labor agreement on the project. Why waive that reporting requirement in those cases? Why not just have it across the board and in every case that you do this reporting for contractors to demonstrate that they have a skilled workforce?
2790	Weber	Shirley	44	jsGbKJLFERc	297	314	I went to school districts for a week where constantly changing IT, we didn't have in-house people, and we sold a bill of goods every time you turn around, somebody selling IT to us, and then we'd have to pay a fortune to have them install it and a fortune to maintain it, and by the time people figured it out, it was outdated.
2791	Leno	Mark	60	4PUbEmkSLAQ	72	93	Children who are raised in poverty are more likely to drop out of school, a child without a high school diploma has a seven times greater likelihood of finding his or her way into our criminal justice system, so poverty impacts crime rates, which is a definition of the safety that we have in our neighborhoods and our communities.
2792	Nielsen	Jim	68	J-efxTqVOiQ	260	271	They labor even harder than we do in the dark of night, and we thank them for their valiant efforts. And our members, who've labored long and hard in the subcommittees that got us to this point.
2793	Lara	Ricardo	107	rn8iMdWxrk0	1456	1474	SB 10 will not be a brick and mortar office. It would not be an added bureaucracy. Instead, it would be a strategic hub of innovation and strategy that will ensure we don't miss opportunities to maximize our state's investment in our immigrant communities and economic prosperity. I respectfully ask for your aye votes.
2794	De Leon	Kevin	102	TKhvu3W6NHQ	1156	1179	So given the fact that a lot of folks knew, that perhaps theoretically at least, that this was looming on the horizon and obviously because of the we're in the fourth year of a crisis, historic drought. I'm not a meteorologist, none of us are, nobody in the audience, but we don't know if frankly it's gonna get better or if it's gonna get worse.
2795	Hancock	Loni	98	nqnHx0FnCOc	1025	1051	Okay, we'll wait 'til the May revise, but you know we'll be waiting with bated breath, right, for the May revise. Yeah, and thank you very much, because it's helpful to us. So, this is really the same topic, but let's move to the in-fill beds then, which actually are gonna get back to, I think, the core question, which is,
2796	Gallagher	James	108	6e0LFFmZAnE	772	785	that if you are, truly, refusing service to someone solely based on their language or with their immigration status, citizenship, that's already gonna be covered under the statute, right?
2797	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	_wQgbHlbFh8	27	43	Good afternoon, Assembly Member Wilk, my apologies. We were hearing a rather difficult bill on the genocide. I didn't want to get up and leave, for fear of offending everybody, as compared to just anybody.
2798	Calderon	Ian Charles	115	BISvC49mosc	1486	1505	and these are tech companies that feel like they, under the Chamber of Commerce amendments, if they are a good actor, they will be more punished under what was being proposed by the Chamber, as opposed to the original version, and were are actually very adamant that the bill stay as the original version rather than with the amendments.
2799	Dababneh	Matthew	50	9MQl_MfHN90	2052	2071	How would this law affect their requirements when they're selling a private car or also, if they're in the business of selling cars? I mean if they're not, right now, I've seen people that are kind of popping up, selling cars over the Internet. You can buy a car on Craigslist. You can buy a car through a number of different websites. It's obviously not on a dealer's lot.
2800	Stone	Jeff	26	y23O4kWOpz4	608	623	We have compromised potable water that could have been used for our citizens. Senator, frankly, it's zero. It's zero. I think that there are some things that DOGGR has been doing that's been good.
2801	Galgiani	Cathleen	95	2Dc5I9_7zFA	1208	1235	So here's a question in Part 2, if you have an apartment complex, are you allowed to rent out unused spaces as just parking? Like for example, around here, there are a lot of staff members who need parking spaces. I think Capitol Towers complex here in Sacramento, I know they require payment for their parking spots if you want a parking space.
2802	Alejo	Luis	9	MlLd7E1te-c	791	801	regs and guidelines are coming out as different parts of the bond roll-out what do you see in terms of perhaps East Porterville benefiting from part of that those funds?
2803	Block	Marty	59	KyjcaFzffNo	1326	1341	What this bill does is it provides for California scientists, UC and other scientists to study these rivers, do the research, so that we can now know when these moisture events are coming.
2804	Gomez	Jimmy	80	rzSOQHmJW3U	1618	1659	SB 644 Hancock. LEAP program internships for persons with developmental disabilities. Do pass as amendment to add a five year sunset provision. A roll call. The meeting is hereby adjourned.
2805	Leno	Mark	60	l1HWjxTN3mM	1311	1335	And so if I could, I just want to share with you that in the association's original opposition letter to our bill some months ago, it attempted to cite UCLA civil rights projects forthcoming report, analyzing suspension and expulsion data at California charter schools, to support their claim that there's no problem.
2806	Thurmond	Tony	4	WE6m9wVcbNQ	1021	1042	Thank you for sharing. Look, I'm happy for all of the folks who said that this has helped, that e-cigarettes has helped them to stop smoking. I do have some critical questions though because I think that this is a serious issue and is impacting young people in a serious way.
2807	Stone	Jeff	26	7ULUe19PTjQ	650	672	One, the patient has a terminal illness and has exhausted all conventional treatment options. Two, the patient's doctor has advised the use of an investigational drug. Three, the investigational drug has successfully completed basic safety testing. Four, the patient has provided informed consent.
2808	Hueso	Ben	48	519YUTER2IM	1713	1730	And before us adopting a standard for either type of generation. Neither agency was to adopt a performance standard unless first determined that the standard would number one, not harm reliability of electrical grid or hamper further deployment of renewable energy or reduction of GHG emissions.
2809	De Leon	Kevin	102	-v1uD0LX8sQ	1068	1087	And I'm elated that we collectively work very hard to move an agenda that will hopefully deliver real results to the constituents that we represent. Now, Houston Texas is the fossil fuel capital, if not the world, at least the United States of America
2810	Baker	Catharine	74	dKlfu24NXRk	691	708	Thank you Mr. Chairman and thank you Member Gonzalez for the interest in making sure more participate in our democratic process. I guess my concerns about this bill are two-fold. First of all, there's-- I haven't heard any evidence that the lack of registration is why people don't vote because there's a lot of people who are already registered and they don't vote.
2811	Quirk	Bill	23	KMXnTjJiK-4	936	953	Yes, I mean certainly I would hope that when we get through all of this, we'll say when there's civil litigation that you're able to view it. The question is to what extent should that also be made public?
2812	Eggman	Susan Talamantes	73	9fvwP7KwrvY	2016	2034	I don't know about you but some of my hospitals, when I was first running. I said what can we do cuz the physician shortage. Get rid of the corporate ban. We need to get, if we can do that we'll be able to do a better job recruiting, getting people in. So again we're talking about a structure that, there's no big evidence that I've seen that says it provides a higher level of patient protection.
2813	Mayes	Chad	79	H9sj-95HbgQ	1223	1239	The one thing I'm a little, looking for the right word here, maybe a little concerned with this resolution is the Census Bureau they've got the supplemental poverty measure data 2013.
2814	Lara	Ricardo	107	8ZmrJUXXU4k	139	147	Members of our finest educational institutions should not be engaged in a race to the bottom for pay and benefits for its workers. I respectfully ask for your aye votes.
2815	Beall	Jim	92	u1CD9eH0kHI	61	79	But what I'd like to do is get a statement that shows what the real balance in the general fund is in the future. Like, if we could get, here's the balance. Here's the real balance based on the Department of Finance estimates. Here's what they estimate we are going to be looking at down the road.
2816	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	H1s_v6dAj4A	165	180	So it would really be helpful to me and probably to all of us sitting here today to get some ideas form you. Setting some performance standards as we were talking earlier with our Departments of Social Services.
2817	Lara	Ricardo	107	Gf9OHu0urRM	973	993	I mean, members this is another area where we really need to look at. With the fact you have a handful of African Americans. I think it was three in the UCLA Law School class. I mean, that's shocking. The other thing is, my question is we tout the UCs' diversity. Are these international students counted in the diversity mix?
2818	Thurmond	Tony	4	6ioGJXSDTzs	1636	1642	You know, I'm a both kind of person, right? And I want to make sure you have enough money to pay your rent and eat. Not have to choose one or the other.
2819	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	I1DeZTgw_DI	1225	1239	However, as far as, and to do away with the first line of opposition, yes, we're going to change the collective bargaining agreement exemption to mirror the overtime collective bargaining agreement exemption that does not have a reference to paid sick days.
2820	Allen	Benjamin	70	6q5JSfST1YQ	875	887	I want to thank the committee and its staff for lending its expertise and advice to my staff as we worked on this issue. And as this bill hopefully moves forward, I expect and welcome the opportunity to engage with stake holders
2821	Chavez	Rocky	83	vE1aI3Q_hng	115	145	Hey Chairman, and by the way, you're doing a great job running this meeting, it's a tough one, I appreciate what you're doing. I'll announce to the group, everybody's been asking me why I'm mad on this. I guess I have not made my mind up. As Dr. Pan, you and I have talked before, but I'm listening intently to discussion and I'm just going to ask you a couple of questions to kinda focus me and I'll go to the other group. And you don't have to give me the big speech, I just kinda wanna get the answer.
2822	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	JG7mRMz5Gp8	1573	1582	I might add, in making sure that we have first class facilities in Los Angeles Unified School District. With your indulgence, Mr. Chair, I'd like to have my witnesses present.
2823	Allen	Benjamin	70	6q5JSfST1YQ	888	896	to balance the unique concerns of both state and local governments and those who work on the roads. I respectfully request your aye vote on this measure. Thank you.
2824	Pan	Richard	96	YovLyNfdmT8	1250	1267	And actually I find its felling, I know you said don't look at any individual plan, but on page 12 I noticed that one MCO under the tier tax, so actually the mid-sized one which is smaller, would actually have to pay a larger tier tax than a large MCO, right?
2825	Weber	Shirley	44	Ks2cqtpLqGI	922	955	Okay. Now, oftentimes local control funding formula is somewhat misleading because there's a big thing and then there's the smaller piece that deals with concentration grants. Is this the $10.8  billion for concentration grant or the overall local control funding formula? Because one addresses the issue of poverty and language and foster care, which is a portion of it, but not the whole piece. I am trying to figure out exactly how much of this is really for the poverty and income issue, in terms of the concentration grant that is a part of the local control funding formula.
2826	Hernandez	Ed	103	o_iCJQqprWQ	1621	1628	And what do you attribute that to? Is that because we have higher areas of diversity and, you know, more areas of need than other states or what's the reason?
2827	Chiu	David	7	1ULf869aoVg	1275	1293	Mr. Dababneh has asked for an aye vote. The clerk will open the roll. All those vote who desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote.
2828	Mitchell	Holly	64	66IpAVpTbHU	1023	1032	I participate every year and it's great. It's feel-good, but it's not enough. When the article states black students are far more likely to live in poor communities and attend public schools, lacking in college counseling and academic resources, such as AP and Honors courses, needed to qualify for college, and they're less likely to live with parents and caregivers who have attended college who can advise them. And that was a quote by Tyrone Howard, a professor of education at UCLA, and he leads their black male institute.
2829	Stone	Mark	20	8AAoooSnIWE	878	890	Thank you Mr. Chair.  And, so we have Jerry Alistar, Program Coordinator of the American Friends Services Committee, and Jim Lindburg Legislative Director of Friends Committee on Legislation of California, in support.
2830	Thurmond	Tony	4	eYTxGLtgMco	2050	2067	I kid you not, on the very first night I was sworn in, we were asked to vote to close ten schools. I couldn't believe it. And for someone to say, we know it's not good for kids, and we're gonna ask you to do it anyway. They were high-performing schools that served kids of color, and that we're doing what, I could not believe it.
2831	Beall	Jim	92	yp3pHtPtFfM	1711	1733	I don't want to go on at length. But, I want to say I'm finding myself in agreement with my Republican colleagues on some of these issues with the receiver and, I'll just say this.
2832	Liu	Carol	63	Laqdju9yTYg	114	137	So, it's an interesting, from my perspective of how we are evolving because I think the public is not wanting to incarcerate and wanting more people to be treated for their issues. As opposed to just lock them up and throw-away the key because it doesn't seem to be working.
2833	Pan	Richard	96	m65WWf8IMs4	850	870	There is no other restriction on the judgement of a licensed physician, so anyone who said that they have a licensed physician who told them they couldn't get immunized, should be able to get a medical exemption, and then those children, because they're not immunized, require protection. When you talk about do you have children who may be partially immunized, they may have certain vaccines, they may not take other vaccines.
2834	Medina	Jose	81	3I7f3vKVAeA	508	530	Thank you, Mr. Speaker. There has been much discussion on SB 350. As with most things, one size does not fit all. This is definitely the case in my district with SB 350. I appreciate the author's attention and willingness to accept the most recent amendments, however, they still do not go far enough.
2835	Medina	Jose	81	3I7f3vKVAeA	530	549	It's not uncommon for a bill of this magnitude to have unintended consequences. Members, I attend to support this measure today despite some reservations. I have a small public utility in my district, it will be negatively impacted by the unintended consequences of this bill.
2836	Hertzberg	Robert	99	emhy9UKtKg0	1269	1285	Yeah, I just want to, the thing is, look big co's have a zillion people out there that read all this stuff. Nobody in small businesses reads this stuff and know what we do, except they're worried about worker's comp and they're worried about labor commissioners and that's about it, right we pass all these laws.
2837	Brown	Cheryl	13	uMVL-8VKWCc	498	518	Between 2005 and 2012, the number of assaults resulting in injuries to staff at the Atascadero State Hospital doubled, and there are 3,000 assaults per year at Napa State Hospital. A substantial number of the assaults are believed to be committed by maligners.
2838	Gordon	Richard	117	elRk6CudldM	1996	2026	And I am committed to trying to work with them and with the department to resolve that problem because I think that that would be helpful in the bail process. So, when I took this on, I thought this looked like kind of a simple bill and here I am realizing that if this moves forward today, I've got a lot more work to do because I think there is an opportunity and we ought to take the opportunity.
2839	Baker	Catharine	74	_wQgbHlbFh8	1257	1266	Thank you. And thank you for this bill. I'm gonna support your bill today, and I haven't had the creepy experience that our colleagues have had, but I see it coming.
2840	Bates	Pat	58	-Hx2WQtEpHs	903	916	Well you, we've talked about business model earlier, and in the hearing and you seem to have one that's really put you at at the front of the education nonprofit.
2841	Mitchell	Holly	64	9Bh-K6ce5kc	1914	1932	Thank you very much. And we will hold that item on page 41 open. Moving on to item number 8 Medi-Cal continuation of the 1115 waiver workload page 43.
2842	Dodd	Bill	71	MhEV1ONtJ2I	247	262	- OK. So regardless of the contract, the first thing you said there is that we failed to plan, staff, and manage this project from the very beginning, on so many levels.
2843	Leno	Mark	60	ELlYlrBZUfQ	1390	1403	Well stated. I've got one more question, then we're going to give Ms. Bosler the last word on this issue and then we're gonna move forward. The repairs. Is $1.5 billion in the right neighborhood of expense?
2844	Weber	Shirley	44	dv1TuQD9iKk	1116	1127	And you're lookin' and seein'. You're drivin' within the speed limit. There's nothing wrong with your car. And you're thinkin', "Oh my god, what now?" And you know it's gonna be an experience where they're gonna take you out your car, sit you on the curb.
2845	Hertzberg	Robert	99	b7XHatlYhkw	1777	1788	in either house and sits back and analyzed this and said, sorry we're not gonna do it. Everything's acted upon. And so if you have a situation where somebody's been gone say, statute of limitations is run, whatever it might be.
2846	De Leon	Kevin	102	FHGwb8kBog8	1141	1171	Whether its the State Controller with the situation, whether it is the DMV. Whether it is the Secretary of State and this issue of BreEZe. But what's before us right now is you, as an individual, and whether we have. Can you please turn that off? And, whether we have the confidence in your abilities  to lead this department. And I do believe, you know, the confidence is there.
2847	Quirk	Bill	23	pqf8UezhQwo	144	165	Good morning, Chair and members. Yes. Assembly bill 33 would establish the Energy Sector Emissions Reduction Advisory Council and charge it with analyzing various strategies that could be implemented to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from electricity sector.
2848	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	ok4qN3L6USs	90	102	Just on a note, nothing is more important in a district like mine where we have far more than 21% of English learners to figure out a reclassification standard that moves people into speaking English proficiently.
2849	Hill	Jerry	66	cwCFlp-Kh9Y	1729	1759	I thank you and your new staff level positions that those in it have done I think an excellent job of refocusing the commission and taking the direction that is I think important especially related to safety and I think is the President obviously share mentioned I think you and I were out in front of the PUC in alternate days last, every couple of years doing different things naturally but I appreciate that focus on safety.
2850	Gatto	Mike	46	ch_qINsbUNA	1491	1513	However, some cities do have laws on the books that prohibit-home owners from removing their lawns, and this bill would require cities to allow homeowners to replace their lawns if the homeowners so wish.
2851	Block	Marty	59	nlURi31-KJY	1251	1265	years, 37 years as an accounting Professor at San Diego City College, while also concurrently teaching at the high school level for 32 of those 37 years. He enjoyed policy work but he really loves the students,
2852	Roth	Richard	106	JZLdEqkqLz4	2261	2275	Well you probably prefer that. You'd probably would not want to be paying the state's legal costs if the state wins however infrequent that is, right? You answered my question I just didn't understand is there any.
2853	Beall	Jim	92	pJxZbc1RoIw	1307	1325	Because it's very unreliable as a nexus because unless you have some specific project, you cannot. Like I would say getting people to do active transportation. Maybe some of those kinds of things would be nexus. There's some areas of transportation.
2854	Leno	Mark	60	xOTz1OskesQ	880	904	I could also further respond, Senator. The suggestion is that this very onerous and very costly. I think you can think it through to yourself. We're talking about one little label to put on. It's not very costly and in fact, before these products were deemed to be non flammable, they had to make note with a label on their products that they complied with the fire safety standard.
2855	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	0J9n2c3eCds	1202	1227	it's impacting other users and ground water basins. I just, it seems so premature to me and with that in mind I just can't support this until you can come back with something that demonstrates, with evidence demonstrates that this is having a negative impact or is not achieving the goal which is to be able to try
2856	McCarty	Kevin	22	B6r57uGOz9Y	817	832	Okay. I see we have Mr. Troy back there with the Chancellor's office. Did you want to say something as far as the community colleges? I'm not sure if the Board of Governors adopted some type of budget principles as far as a wishlist if there are any additional revenues available.
2857	Pavley	Fran	104	kvK2sg30nzk	494	511	The expenditure plan looks at reducing GHG's right, mitigating climate change. But there's those double win possibilities out there on adaptation. Could you talk about one or two of those, someone? That you could quantify.
2858	Thurmond	Tony	4	9UYl1IR1e0U	502	526	Thank you, Mr. Chair. I actually wanted to ask Mr. Martin if he could elaborate. You were explaining that this bill would create additional financial burden for charter schools. I believe you were and I'll be honest, I don't always think that creating an expense for something that has to be done is enough of a reason to not do the thing.
2859	Beall	Jim	92	9GlTqPUGK00	69	91	AB 8 of 2013 extended the funding for Carl Moyer and several other emission reduction programs. AB 8 also required the ARB and most local air districts to convene a public process to now evaluate the 15 year Carl Moyer program.
2860	Stone	Jeff	26	L-zMn7PZXCE	31	46	What are you doing to make sure that we issue those citations in a timely way? Or at least let the institution know that there is major issues that we're concerned about, that they're putting the public at risk?
2861	Thurmond	Tony	4	q7LT4HnI37Y	1062	1084	And there was something about how fines and fees get assessed. And it struck me, the comment was to the effect that there aren't any, and that struck me as odd. It would seem to me that if there are bad actors that you, as much as anyone else, want them to be identified. That there be financial consequences for that and
2862	Holden	Chris	78	3qih0GbNdAY	238	257	Numerous studies including several conducted by the James Irvine Foundation in California have shown that concurrent enrollment programs decreased at the time that students take to graduate, increased student confidence, increased average GPAs and increased the likelihood of graduation from college.
2863	Low	Evan	11	8bOmzPkZfE0	1145	1161	This simply put would make a requirement for service learning upon graduation from high school. As we all know, much of the opportunity exists to increase our opportunity in terms of educational as related to civics, and to sense of duty to our respected communities.
2864	Gallagher	James	108	OqtPmd4MeNE	2017	2038	So I don't know if that's something you guys might be open to working in the future and then the other one is on the, the stand, the having it have to abide by this private organizations standards. Is there any openness to maybe saying, look, they'll have to, you're considering good faith, those standards?
2865	Hueso	Ben	48	ejG5Ru6MX_o	864	879	We'll work with you to craft that language to ensure that the person has that breadth of experience, absolutely. Within that person's experience is not, right? Am I understanding that?
2866	Mitchell	Holly	64	yiLVh_sTRu0	796	808	Moving on to State Hearings Division, the Health and Human Services Agency, Office of Systems Integration, overview of the state's Hearing Division, first informational, then we'll hear about BCP number two.
2867	Wood	Jim	72	YSUIHVlik4w	182	197	We are on a tight schedule, so if I get a little tight with you on time, please don't take offense at that. We have a lot of speakers. There's a pretty ambitious agenda so we will try to move things along.
2868	Nielsen	Jim	68	YLKuY8cYE0M	1773	1788	I really don't like that. I remember years ago my executive officer, or chief administration, came in said, boy we've got a lot money we can spend. I said what do you mean? Where did we get all that money? Well we can buy some computers and blah, blah, blah.
2869	Wilk	Scott	19	h-QyikgWJeU	294	312	As you may know, tomorrow will be the 104th anniversary of the President's birthday and June 5th will be the eleventh year since he has left us. To me, Ronald Reagan is a quintessential American. Grew up, humble roots. You know, his nickname was "dutch" because you look like a little dutch boy because they couldn't afford to go the barber, so his mother would put a bowl on top of his head and cut his hair.
2870	Hill	Jerry	66	UqQcd0TyhPE	1556	1566	If we could do the title, but it should probably be practice and that maybe the next step forward at some point in time, but I do think there's some consumer protection related to it as well. Is there a motion?
2871	Moorlach	John	4657	wxAms1gWFJA	2064	2082	What's been a little disturbing in the last two years is that we were proposing to widen the 405 Freeway and expand 17 bridges, only then to have Caltrans come in and say, "Hey thank you very much. We'll take the middle lanes." And so that's a little disturbing to be a Self-Help County and then have the state try to commandeer what you're paying for.
2872	Gatto	Mike	46	L_fXwOpVblo	686	699	How many people knew that those samples were then given out to researchers to do research on? There's not been a single parent who has come to us who has said that they were aware of this.
2873	Weber	Shirley	44	sxH5Xtvq9A4	264	274	Racial profiling is not. Racial profiling is first of all is based on perception. People are stopped because they believe they are a certain type of individual that they may not be.
2874	Moorlach	John	4657	Q9LdqK3BIlI	1100	1124	And it also states in here that it's obviously higher than the actual cost because in the code it says unless the fee is reduced pursuant to this section. I'm just sort of concerned that we're extending a fee for another three years where there's no correlation as to what it really, that's really just covering the actual cost.
2875	Hill	Jerry	66	lR1EcqihPaQ	1555	1592	Very good. Well there was a, some issues that were mentioned to respond to. I see we have Issue 7, Issue 10, and Issue 13 were designated in the paper and then certainly the members of the committees can ask any questions that they feel appropriate. But if you do have a prepared response for Issue 7 which was laid out, that's the issue of the Commission's revenues and the predictability of those. Or the lack of predictability.
2876	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	2UiNZW2oc6A	73	88	Title IX has been I think one of the most significant civil rights for girls and women in our state and county, actually this is a federal legislation, in the last fifty years.
2877	Garcia	Eduardo	38	1fxZCVj9XoA	491	511	As you know, the metal theft problems have impacted not only public agencies but also private entities, builders, the farm community, and many state agencies as well that have been impacted by the vandalism and the theft of metal.
2878	Rendon	Anthony	120	hrVBNy8V670	221	235	We have engage the stakeholders on a large email list so they know what kind of proposal we have been receiving and we encourage open discussion of those proposals. That's where we start and how we will proceed to consider all the issues that they identify.
2879	Atkins	Toni	110	8g5e-OGL0_Y	1157	1173	in the holocaust. She moved with her family to California in 1950. In 1956 she went on a date with Andrew Viterbi . It may have been the only time that chemistry proved more important to him than engineering. If I may I'd like to read a lovely statement about Erna from Rafael Reif,
2880	Hernandez	Roger	37	23L8yaBtAnI	603	619	She's been asked to remove small business, she's done that. She's been asked to remove the emergency services community, hospitals, she's done that. Every step of the ways she's fighting to keep give us the opportunity to keep our families together on such an important holiday, one we all enjoy.
2881	Mitchell	Holly	64	zjaMes6iB6Q	150	165	Lastly, it mandates training for physicians, social workers, foster kids, caregivers, all those, all the key stakeholders that are in this child's life, regarding psychotropic medications, and what we know about them today.
2882	Mendoza	Tony	52	2Yu9E6dAMwM	1360	1377	But, having the protections of having to keep the experienced teachers there, teachers with a lot of knowhow, for me I find it very rewarding when I was a new teacher I would go to them and get the support that I needed.
2883	Hall	Isadore	1	OaKXojP7k_0	1628	1655	Yes, thank you, Madam President and Senators. AB 521 requires an HIV test to be offered to any patient upon being admitted to a hospital, subject to patient consent. Members, HIV and AIDS is a devastating disease that continues to be a leading cause of death in the United States. By increasing opportunities to test for
2884	Gordon	Richard	117	c9Ojvyv2LI0	528	539	What are we gonna do in the long term? Yeah. To adapt California to what will be a changed environment. And so I'm pleased with the focus and look forward to working with you.
2885	Allen	Travis	43	hnhklV-igrA	2069	2085	Ultimately, our goal is trying to protect public health, increase vaccination rates, prevent the likelihood of an outbreak, protect kids, make sure the parents know that the government is taking reasonable steps to ensure that when they send their kids to school, they will not be exposed to dangerous communicable diseases that we have the tools to stop. That's what this is about.
2886	Weber	Shirley	44	_MyNlUiIS5o	709	725	In a recent poll shows that 55% of Californians and 85% of African Americans in California believe that blacks and other minorities do not receive equal treatment in the criminal justice system. Another poll shows that more than three in four black voters in California believe the police
2887	Hernandez	Ed	103	WbtRyMk2fD8	1265	1283	No, no, I agree with the safety net. I don't know if that's gonna change behavior of law enforcement to go after somebody who is abusing animals. I think it just unfortunately falls, it's not the highest priority in what they want to do. My only concern is just the precedence setting that it is setting to bring other providers from other states and
2888	Nguyen	Janet	65	6Q9j6EYWwEw	1498	1520	We should never let any of these families have to deal with that. We had to make that decision when this legislative fail us from Orange County. I fought for those families because I was in that situation and it's wrong that we're making promises we cannot keep for these children and families.
2889	Mitchell	Holly	64	0QEuIEsELpg	72	86	Let me begin by accepting the committee amendments. Both those are listed on page six and seven of the analysis, plus an additional amendment that is included in the mock-up, that has been provided to members.
2890	Hill	Jerry	66	N-Bfbq4TmhI	1736	1754	So you're not delaying anything if the communication is five days after the dispensing of the product. And, and, and the, the opposition from these large pharmacy chains is interesting because as I mentioned in my opening, they already do it million, they communicate millions of times a month in California to the physicians.
2891	Mitchell	Holly	64	4YUeKJp9AQ0	531	551	They also have a responsibility to respond to home owners whose units have been damaged as a result of damage in a commonary they didn't attend to. And so we've addressed it in policy Committee. I've said it repeatedly that we do not believe they will be held responsible, and I think code sections and their OCCRs clarify that.
2892	Dodd	Bill	71	r49jrzf4Gi8	419	442	RD 108 is located along the western edge of the Sacramento River in my district and delivers water to nearly 48,000 acres of farm land, within southern Calusa and Northern Yellow County. Energy is a siginficant operating expense for RD108. Water and recycled water enters and leaves the district through a number of pumping facilities.
2893	Anderson	Joel	57	PFemgtd0i88	810	825	What I like about this bill is the very thing that you spoke against it. I like the flexibility that every community is different and further along than others, and this would give them the flexibility to choose how to best meet the need in their community.
2894	Leno	Mark	60	Skk_s7qoQEk	1885	1898	And I would argue strongly that no one's voice is being ignored or not respected through this process. And it just takes some time. We wanna bring everyone along as far as we can.
2895	Beall	Jim	92	hqvUVHybZBI	335	365	I think we need to really focus on that so we never see this kind of thing happen again, this is just horrible. I had several hundred people in my community that lost tens of thousands of dollars and delayed their education worse yet and their family was depending on their education being achieved and they weren't able to complete it due to this catastrophe that happened.
2896	Allen	Benjamin	70	ZMZhi0vPE74	798	809	In fact, we're going to add in language based on our conversations with the opponents that will make it explicit that the Board can actually say that a permit would not even be necessary in certain cases if they felt -- if it's de minimus.
2897	Weber	Shirley	44	eiRf682j8LU	1979	1993	Because that simply reinforced what was happening every day in the lives of young people. What I did was an enrichment program where I taught African American history to these young people. And as a result of that, they had the motivation to go back and become excellent in every subject.
2898	Dodd	Bill	71	6dKd_uGq3Mo	1020	1035	I, the, the committee staff, I guess, is saying add the following language to ensure that a franchisee would not be able to file suit to seek additional remedies if the franchise is sold by a franchisee before the franchise relationship is terminated.
2899	Brown	Cheryl	13	60U_LMI0eIw	953	976	One of the things that I think is, I personally do, is give bigger tips. And so, I don't know how much money they make, but now I'll go back and I'll talk to the owner. And this particular owner has done what you said. She has worked with her employees.
2900	Mendoza	Tony	52	SK-C_51Liio	964	981	Mr. Leno, Senator Leno, thank you again  The testimony was really good on both sides. Appreciate you coming by. The Ellis Act was intending to allow landlords to exit the rental business. And I know that San Francisco has very strong tenant protections, which is good.
2901	Huff	Bob	105	_C-l6C8Fln0	845	863	That is we made history by electing the first Vietnamese American woman to the California Legislature and that is Senator Janet Nguyen. I've served in both houses as many of you have and that tradition will changes as you can served 12 years in either house, but we kind of like our red carpet here in the tradition that hails back to the royalty and those guys over in the green carpet.
2902	Leno	Mark	60	nj31ZcgCRww	189	214	Thank you. So the issue before us of course is the growing phenomenon and use of e-cigarettes. A serious health risk to the state of California specifically, because the largest growth in the market of e-cigarettes is among middle and high schoolers. This should concern us very much.
2903	Perea	Henry	33	3kfM97VupkU	485	513	And I think we would be doing a big disservice to many of our constituents. I mean look, I'm raising my family in Fresno, I have a young daughter, a young son, I want them to breathe cleaner air. And certainly I want to incentivize that future technology or whatever it might be that is absolutely at zero, but until we get there. I'm afraid that we'll pass up on technologies that can help us breathe cleaner air in our communities and diesel trucks.
2904	Huff	Bob	105	_C-l6C8Fln0	899	918	Among the things we need the tackle, we certainly need to continue boosting our economy and making sure that the unemployed and find a job and we need to continue to work to reform our education system, so that every student has the opportunity to learn from good teachers.
2905	Mayes	Chad	79	XCc8jyb6PaM	1487	1498	In fact, I think from what we've seen, vaccines have been really a wonder of science in making sure that, to stop the spread of any diseases, but In looking over the analysis here.
2906	Allen	Benjamin	70	y6U-ceBCkoc	90	108	According to a 2003 study by the Water Board, the power equipment used by suction dredgers to vacuum up the stream beds can cause a plume of mercury-ladened sediment to travel downstream, which, of course, can be harmful to both water quality, public health, endangered species, and cultural sites.
2907	Stone	Mark	20	0xUa-SoTZfU	610	636	And then has an expectation that they're going to perform their functions as written for that institution. That's fine as a teacher. The example, a Jewish individual teaching at a Catholic school. Is there a presumption, then, that that person will live their lives according to Catholic tenants when their lives and their whole culture, their history, their beliefs are actually different.
2908	Nielsen	Jim	68	MoWOcX9DkpU	679	693	I think that's certainly worthy of consideration and again I'm not convinced of the need the manifest need of something of this magnitude at this point that's going to lie just a third of a billion dollars.
2909	Achadjian	K.H. "Katcho"	5	kQ8roglP29M	1910	1923	Thank you, Mr. Chair. It doesn't have really to do with your bill, but I also have received complaints when cars are towed legally from a parking lot because somebody didn't pay or it said, "no place to park."
2910	Liu	Carol	63	c9mBAjkLpP8	41	92	We have five. We have a quorum. Before we begin hearing just a couple of bills, I'd like to begin this hearing with a short tribute to John Muckler who was a friend and mentor to many. I know Dr. Pan said this on the Senate Floor. And John passed on March 3rd. He spent most of his career working on education policy and served in many capacities, including: an education consultant to the Assembly Ways and Means Committee, education adviser to Willie Brown, Speaker Willie Brown, Executive Director to the state board of education, Secretary for Education under Governor Davis, and education advisor extraordinaire and a partner in a well-respected consulting firm. John is known as the father of Proposition 98, which established a minimum funding guarantee for public schools.
2911	Allen	Benjamin	70	MbrLwdg2wyw	520	534	This will be a quick portion of the agenda. And I apologize for the change in the scheduling. But, it has to do with some scheduling issues. So, you can sit up in these chairs and speak to us and we appreciate you both being here.
2912	Fuller	Jean	49	A5ksLI96f9Q	578	598	Mr. Minor I appreciated our time together again. And you have a, a very good grasp of the professional qualifications and experiences that you needed and you have a good heart. And it seems to me that I'm willing to trust your heart today to let you have another chance. Thank you.
2913	Gipson	Mike	28	kmplgTQ8GXM	905	932	Thank you very much. Body, I will simply ask on aye vote, again this is in my district, I believe that the Coompton Community College have made great strides, and I think that we need to make sure that our state receiver, the persons in charge continue to make sure they live up to the laws and report back to the community on benchmarks and making sure that they have a clear path of success to remove Community College out of trustee. Thank you. I ask for an aye vote.
2914	Gomez	Jimmy	80	gln4qw7E9v8	531	557	Good, just thank you for coming and thank the chair for his excellent job today and his hard work over the years. There's a lot of issues we need to look up, but we have to have the discussion based on the facts and I know funding and revenues could be a major issue that we're gonna have to break down. A lot of the money over the last several years coming into the general fund has been dedicated to Prop 98.
2915	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	QkQlxH8U7IE	1393	1402	Well I appreciate that and I think that's shared by many of us and let us continue to work together. I appreciate your effort and the discussion today. Thank you very much.
2916	Lackey	Tom	10	seV-S-c1PNk	237	258	Mr. Chair, Members.  This is certainly an honor to stand before you for the first-time I've met before this Committee.  As many of you may be aware, my career is 28 years long with the California Highway Patrol and enforcing laws, as they relate to irresponsible motorcycle driving, is nothing new to me.
2917	Roth	Richard	106	xQtK7XDQgbs	1401	1417	Or, further capping the out of state enrollment that these popular universities at a level below that of 2004. I assume that's when increase in out of state tuition, I mean, the out of state students started to ramp up.
2918	Mitchell	Holly	64	k4GcCA0Jbo4	1552	1566	I'm very concerned about making sure rules are adhered to, and the ethics around civil, civil seizure and forfeiture are well understood by law enforcement. So I'm working with committee staff to ensure this training is funded by the formula in this bill.
2919	McCarty	Kevin	22	eyvCaUn-6sE	1682	1697	Thank you. Any other comments from committee members? OK. So just maybe to follow up on my earlier question, maybe for you Mr. Cabral. This is an area of interest of the subcommittee.
2920	Roth	Richard	106	SCWpb6PxRGE	1894	1919	Thank you Madame Chair. First, I want to thank all of the participants in this process, particularly the participants in opposition to the bill. And I want each and every one of you to know that I have the highest respect for you. I have the highest respect for your advocacy and your focus on this issue, and I pledge to work with you and your organizations to, to achieve what we're talking about here, which is equal access for all.
2921	Leno	Mark	60	dSqmLCv394A	53	73	That's not to suggest we shouldn't do something, which is why I support the bill. To what degree do you think this will up their game? Or do you think that they're struggling because they just have not found appropriately strong defensive technology?
2922	Hall	Isadore	1	zjaMes6iB6Q	820	841	Still morning, good morning. This feels good to be back on the green carpet. You all look great over here. Mr. Lahill is still, I'll leave it alone. Whenever you say so, Mr. Chair.
2923	Calderon	Ian Charles	115	KTS25NPAjyE	1372	1391	And I know that if it were myself or my family that was in this type of a situation, that I at least had the comfort of knowing I lived in a state that provided me the ability to try and swing for the fences and save my own life. And that's what this bill is all about, but I'll go ahead now and turn it over to my witnesses.
2924	Chiu	David	7	a4X1msw4NL8	2046	2115	Seeing and hearing no further debate, the clerk will open the roll. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote.
2925	Nielsen	Jim	68	TPx_LL6qRDw	267	286	I got a little ahead, if anyone in the public that has not yet testified that would like to forward. Some of my old friends, please come on up here. I know Pete Connerty was chomping at the bit to get up here.
2926	Weber	Shirley	44	ITEaoTWbk6c	696	716	Second, it provides an additional $31 million in new target expenditures that include the following: $17 million in additional funding to support emergency food aid to 29 counties most impacted by the drought. It includes $4 million for emergency drinking water in disadvantaged communities
2927	Wood	Jim	72	UUDrPWxX9_Y	305	353	We have here a plant, Exhibit A, that came from Mendocino County yesterday and I'll discuss the significance of this in a couple of minutes. As you are well aware, there are very few environmental regulations for medical cannabis cultivators An estimated 60 to 70% of all of the marijuana consumed in the United States comes from three counties in my assembly district, commonly referred to as the Emerald Triangle. The challenges about conflict with state and federal law have led to a grossly unregulated industry. This has led to serious, and somewhat dire, environmental damage. The biggest problems we are facing is illegal water diversion, unpermitted ponds, unpermitted roads, the judicious use of pesticides, fertilizers, and rodenticides. This is having devastating effects on our watersheds in the face of an already catastrophic drought.
2928	Grove	Shannon	77	9-tqw489jZ4	292	309	Thank you Mr. Speaker. I do rise in support of this bill but I did want to make a comment and follow-up with my colleague from ... . And I know the author's intent and I would appreciate addressing this in the close. My colleague from ... addressed the language that was in the bill that
2929	Mitchell	Holly	64	OHqd1YALBQA	192	222	I represent both Culver City, the new highly merging, hip restaurant location in the state, and less West LA and South LA- that's the Senate district I represent. And so in meeting with restaurant tours were largely small businesses in the district well some of the large corporate chains, we really talked about how the model is changing from the full-service model to what they're calling the fast casual model.
2930	Cooley	Ken	45	PclGdiV7D64	468	485	This will strengthen us in our function of oversight. And I believe it will make us a stronger institution, vis-a-vis the next governor, because while we think about, you know. I'm a ten year member, you're a 12 year member. The real clock running on us actually is, is now the three and a half year clock.
2931	Wieckowski	Bob	55	u6fOz6AZ8WM	1035	1048	Right. I'm just worried about if I give all the money to the counties and locals, which fixes their problem, I created another $5 billion hole for the state, plus the six billion that we need to get the back log.
2932	Wolk	Lois	94	YkUq4Ko6zik	570	615	All right. Thank you for that discussion. We'll hold that open. Look forward to seeing that when we get to the May revise. Let's move on to item three which is the transportation management systems, the TMS system for maintenance and engineering. The governor's proposal is 6.6 million from the SHA and 64 permanent positions for Caltrans to support the TMS. The recommendation is to approve. Any comments from members? All right is there a motion?  All right. It has been moved. Any public comment? All right, seeing none please call the roll.
2933	Wieckowski	Bob	55	u6fOz6AZ8WM	1048	1067	So, I get half of it restored with the VLF and the diesel, but unless I have some sort of vehicle miles traveled, even if it's just for hybrids and electric cars on a flat fee, we're never gonna get our backlog I don??t wanna create more problems, but I wanna get some-
2934	Achadjian	K.H. "Katcho"	5	QoWDHxezaEY	1231	1250	Currently, psych tests are employed to treat serious and violent offenders. In their capacity, many technicians have been threatened and even assuatled. By paroling inmates and and discharged patients AB222 would enchance level of protection for some of the most vulnerable employees at the California Department of Corrections and the Department of State Hospitals.
2935	Stone	Jeff	26	wPtjftt3FVU	551	563	hydraulic fracturing, matrix acidizing, and other drilling techniques to be prepared to support their statements with facts, science and researchable data to verify that their information is accurate, correct.
2936	Mitchell	Holly	64	oU8cNlNqQyg	926	942	And that is just contradictory to what the Feds anticipate and so, to use Senator Stone's term, throwing good money behind bad that we're, I mean it's just, ain't gonna happen.
2937	Garcia	Cristina	112	JQ5xKCGxzzk	1444	1455	And so this bill, I think, is not just about eliminating discrimination, but also saving lives. I mean the science shows that, you know, that one-year deferral is something that we do for so many other things, so that we are safe.
2938	Hall	Isadore	1	mqEFhmjNwxk	1500	1523	Thank you. Mr. Chair and members, SB 63, Seaport Enhanced Infrastructure Financing Districts. SB 63 adds seaports to the list of enhanced infrastructure financing districts approved projects and allows the port to have access to new and vital seaport- Move the bill. Infrastructures- We have a motion and you have a second.
2939	Brown	Cheryl	13	omT12LxK-8I	936	957	Mr. Chairman and members. Thank you for the opportunity to present AB 348. AB 348 is simple but powerful bill that would build upon this year's health trailer bill for the 2015-16 Budget Act, SP 75 signed by the governor.
2940	Hueso	Ben	48	RFWwgE7ubok	2261	2289	It would be a minor change in terms of how the DMV processes information, but you could accomplish one card through one transaction, and I think that has been in terms of for people that carry a lot of documents around, or people that don't want to make a lot of expense when they're traveling. This is a much more efficient program. This saves you a lot of money.
2941	Jones	Brian	42	5kU8DLIkLSI	119	138	Well thank you. And I recognise that. The assembly didn't spend a lot of time on this. It was originally proposed by the Senate Budget Committee and I hope that it's just coincidental in that the Chiropractic Association is the only association that opposed the vaccine bill.
2942	Hernandez	Ed	103	Zuskh5gsbNQ	383	397	And, yes, there's gonna be less impact on certain plans, but just if you can kind of, talking a little bit of difference between the tiered structure and just a flat rate and I think that might also, because there's gonna be a proposal on that as well.
2943	Campos	Nora	76	17weTAXeEGA	985	996	Thank you. The only thing I want to say is let AB 80 be a call to action for our boys and men of color in California. I respectfully ask for your Aye vote.
2944	Weber	Shirley	44	KRvT4-vnFFc	860	882	We have proposed general funds in the Assembly budget because we felt that might be more agreeable, this is a state park. I mean, around this building, is a state park. But we have proposed general funds because we know that the tours that come up here are beneficial to everyone at the Capitol, and to be able to provide for their families, relatives, classrooms.
2945	Gallagher	James	108	qBs9W23Am_w	2229	2249	But I think that is the tough decision. I think that's something that we should very much be thinking about. And we're the judiciary committee. We're overseeing judicial policy and I don't see any other reason for this bill, any other reason for this bill, than to protect public employee unions.
2946	Weber	Shirley	44	mOH5gnV89FM	1661	1690	It expands the location that the CPUC may hold its monthly meetings to include Sacramento and requires the CPUC to notify the Legislature if it contract with outside legal counsel to represent the CPUC in any criminal investigation an expense exceeding $1 million. I respectfully ask for your aye vote on SB103.
2947	De Leon	Kevin	102	OOj1xAhpXgw	178	207	And often times many working-class students hold one job, two or three jobs just to make ends meet, so I think it's really incumbent that we make the right strategic investments for economic growth in California. It was mentioned earlier on another debate that we're the seventh largest economy in the world. That number brings I think a lot of pride to all of us, and we just aggregrate the date, obviously there are parts of California that don't feel like the seventh largest economy in the entire world.
2948	Bloom	Richard	2	CVYbaFO-ROE	115	133	It is the intent of this bill that area's including those that might not be currently recognized nationally or even statewide, as artistic communities will come together, organize, and become arts districts. State designation will nurture local creative economies and benefit communities.
2949	Stone	Jeff	26	zr4fqdcgBEU	1536	1559	And let's not put the developmentally disadvantaged at the bottom of the totem pole year after year. I say do something bold. Do something courageous and show leadership. And let's give these people the restorations they need so they can take care of people that cannot take care of themselves. I beg for your current thoughts.
2950	Irwin	Jacqui	16	SfuHS4UPco0	1266	1293	Are the appropriate services, appropriate areas that you're building in. But, what is the timeline for opening the doors on some of these projects? The money was just issued, and it seems if it's a few years down the road, the next round of money is going to be issued, and the following round of money's going to be issued before anybody's really opened their doors. So, how will you along the way judge how effective a job you're doing?
2951	Mitchell	Holly	64	6XCg5Ws00TU	1217	1234	Okay. It, I want to just back up and get clarification, because as I recall, while we were there, we asked the specific question if this unit would be open prior to the resolution of the other units that are currently in question in Sonoma.
2952	Leyva	Connie	62	nqU0Ufhmqoo	2100	2118	And however we can make sure our youth are prepared for the future is what we should do and also, in talking to different manufacturers, California Steel in particular, manufacturer's are worried about their employees who are aging out, who are retiring and not having a back fill. So, there's no down side to this bill. Thank you, Senator McGuire.
2953	Monning	Bill	25	rrDz5IDQFPY	2547	2565	On item four, we have a 2-0, now we have a 3-0. And now page 43, adopting placeholder trailer bill language on genetic disease screening program, we have 2-0, and now we have a 3-0.
2954	Perea	Henry	33	nsi_dMaCc9g	441	452	I have several disadvantaged communities that are served by mutual water agencies and they should be able to participate so that we do not exclude various areas throughout rural communities.
2955	Pavley	Fran	104	2DrBtZGT7V4	374	387	All right, that, thank you very much for that clarification, and I look forward to working with you, and I appreciate your 15 months you've worked at this. We're seeing improvements. So, thank you Steve. I appreciate it. So, one thing we have, that's really been beneficial is the memorandum of agreement between the State Water Board.
2956	Bonta	Rob	85	WYVStu1Ty2M	1431	1445	One of the greatest leaders within Filipino American and California history is Larry Itliong, a prominent labor organizer and farm worker who fought for social, economic and racial justice on behalf of farm workers and working people.
2957	Pan	Richard	96	msMPqU5kPd8	196	213	Now if you want to sort of solidify that in statute, obviously this is not the immediate time to do it, but I'd love to have a conversation with you about that. Whether if that's something that would make this issue, make this bill more workable for you. We can certainly have that conversation as well.
2958	Dahle	Brian	47	td32uLu5rbg	608	628	Are there other witnesses in support, witnesses in opposition? Seeing none. Questions by members. Seeing none, we have a motion to do pass as amended to probes. Please call the role.
2959	De Leon	Kevin	102	Gcdptg51L2I	1060	1081	This is a man who is a gift to the state of California because you represent your constituents with passion. You believe in your values that you would adhere to every single-day. I really truly enjoy spending time with you in Japan with Maymay, with all the meetings that we had every from morning to night.
2960	Chavez	Rocky	83	JG7mRMz5Gp8	836	856	And that could be anything. They could decide they don't like the way his tie looks today. So they could have him go. Now the word cause is one level. And that could be somebody that says in a contract, you know, you didn't do something, but what if there's a case of something that really egregious.
2961	Chiu	David	7	Tqcxk8QJsXU	2044	2067	And, we will be recessing now for 90 minutes. We'll be reconvene hat 510 again members will be reconvene at 510 at this time this how stands in recess.
2962	Chang	Ling Ling	18	qCEr8jDp5Hg	299	309	Not only is our state's average cost far above the national average But in cities like San Francisco, LA, and even San Jose, the cost of purchasing a home is far above California's average.
2963	Dababneh	Matthew	50	kAZMIWno7zI	615	628	and to make sure that they're working to ensure that their customers and constituents are given a certain respect in treatment after the fact, to make sure they're made whole I think that the government should hold those standards for themselves.
2964	Hueso	Ben	48	GUxOzh3Wh0Q	1595	1617	I know the author is familiar with this. We've had a chance to touch on that briefly. But we're looking at demonstrating that it has an environmental benefit, that it reduces greenhouse gases, and that it be opened up to other energy sources that achieve the same thing on the renewable side.
2965	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	43wK_WUALhw	891	926	And I think probably from a political perspective if we can show numbers of how people are advancing out of poverty, it will generate a sort of belief that we can do it. I think at this point in time a lot of people think poverty's inevitable. And frankly with a lot of the policies in place today, it is inevitable as we keep the lowest earning workers at the lowest paid numbers and we reduce the responsibilities of corporations and the 1% to pay their fair share of taxes.
2966	McGuire	Mike	93	31Xp8hxYTr4	17	27	First of all I just want to say thank you to the Chair and to committee staff for all of their work on this bill. We are grateful for your partnership and we will accept the amendments as proposed.
2967	Thurmond	Tony	4	oSkLr6XY8ps	1862	1876	But, I've heard it stated that many of the systems want to move away from serving folks who are on Medi-Cal. And given the growth in Medi-Cal that was described as part of the Affordable Care Act implementation, we're gonna see even more.
2968	Hertzberg	Robert	99	6z8E6Rb3Uio	767	783	Is there someone missing? Or just this is holding off. OK, Measure passes five, one is the vote. OK. Next, this is SB 433 by Senator Berryhill due pass to appropriations.
2969	Lara	Ricardo	107	nJXs6pD2ors	1653	1668	Next Madame Chair, I will present my SB 42. Which will require prescribers issuing schedule two and three drugs to consult California's controlled substance utilization review and evaluation systems, known as CURES.
2970	Nielsen	Jim	68	BtMKi99jQsY	1417	1431	Thank you Mr. Chairman. I must respectfully say, I probably feel more strongly about this issue than any other one we're gonna deal with in the budget. I put myself in the feet of local law enforcement.
2971	Patterson	Jim	119	79bMZ-eNloc	1500	1526	So that's why I think the policy committees, other than in this moment in time as these things come forward, their voices can only be heard by me in a budget trailer bill committee. Rather than affording them the opportunity for the due process of legislative activity to take place.
2972	Brown	Cheryl	13	k8jlrtfy69g	1036	1056	With specific responsibility to the needs of skilled nursing facilities. I wanna hear regularly from that person about their first-hand experiences accessing unannounced into the facilities that persons will have jurisdiction over, and providing feedback on their observations.
2973	Pavley	Fran	104	vpNS8YXwTNY	1471	1493	I just wanted to make a comment, thank you very much, going to have to go vote in another committee, but certainly supporting this. And listening to the testimony, it's actually, a lot of it's been since, in 2001 and 2002, a lot of the same comments. But what this bill does is set targets.
2974	Thurmond	Tony	4	9oY9RNUdfPk	670	683	Lifting the cap on the family grant. Changing the length of time that families can receive support. You talked about child care, any other barriers that you were seeing in the 24 month period where families were not successful?
2975	Beall	Jim	92	YgvT8VYILiE	108	131	Oh, you do? Okay then we will ask if anybody has any questions. I had a question, because I saw your presentation before, so I know what you did. I thought, has there been any other states that have approached this in any particular way that's been creative in your opinion? Anything else that's going on in other states?
2976	Hertzberg	Robert	99	1-lHMg2FsZ4	188	202	I'm sorry. So, so. But. Hold on. But I'm trying to understand this. My when I look at this, I mean, it might have a tourist effect, but these are expensive cars currently. And people aren't running around, they're, they're, they're rich people that gotta afford one of these cars, right?
2977	De Leon	Kevin	102	mgO95LX_sqE	217	230	They're ahead of the curve. Let me emphasize, once and again, taking control of their own destiny. The county again, will be able to expand its transit system, and address the key needs in the county. Again, this is a very bipartisan measure.
2978	Gomez	Jimmy	80	G2qYCBsWgfA	708	729	Programs such as the energy savings assistance program or ESAP assists low income customers by replacing old and inefficient appliances with energy saving alternatives at zero cost. The benefits of this program, as they relate to providing energy and water efficient appliances that would be otherwise unaffordable to these low-income families, are not in dispute.
2979	Ting	Philip	30	843OfhKnV14	1344	1367	telling at all, it is that we need to see them more often. One of my biggest issues with the PUC is they really started to, frankly, step into our role, which is policy making. And we've seen them really, almost lose focus on their regulatory function and start to steer clear into areas of policy making, which are firmly in our purview.
2980	Calderon	Ian Charles	115	22ufHgqGK-A	1892	1904	Thank you Mr. Chair and Members. I really appreciate your support I look for this measure moving forward and being able to work with every single one of you I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
2981	Morrell	Mike	51	IKESHE_NOXc	889	907	a significant figure in both the Inland Empire and around our state. Hardy was born into a share cropper family in Jones county North Carolina and as a teen he was both the captain of is football team and his basketball team
2982	Hill	Jerry	66	KoF0I8ZWJLM	153	183	In 2010, then Attorney General Jerry Brown settled a case with the nation's largest makers and installers of turf fields, requiring them to reduce levels of lead in their products. In January 2015, the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet began redirecting crumb rubber grant allocations to other uses, rather than continue funding applicants that use waste tires on playgrounds and on athletic fields.
2983	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	EtJ6XaeStes	1915	1928	One specifically what he's talking about, making sure that the home environment is, is safe and protected, because that seems to be one of the major problems that we have, especially in the intercity and other places.
2984	Rendon	Anthony	120	DE6Za__0TWg	658	680	They've been exceptionally forthcoming with respect, visited my office on several occasions, and are providing constant updates about the efforts on behalf of the staff at the CPUC, so we do appreciate them. If there's no one else who wishes to speak, this concludes the July 13th Informational Hearing. The hearing is now adjourned.
2985	Stone	Mark	20	w-20_U9xFyk	1418	1451	Okay. One of the challenges for WBEs and DBEs really is access and this is a lot of an access issue that we're talking about. Larger contractors, who are looking to get contracts with the state, know how to do that and knowhow to lobby. Are there changes that we could and should be looking at with respect to disclosures about those lobbying efforts and about interaction with state government that would help shine the light on the access issues that we have?
2986	Pavley	Fran	104	np2bbuatBtE	1102	1122	And I'd like to make sure you continue to work on this when it goes through the Appropriations Committee Some of the suggestions and recommendations I think had a lot of validity to them. And the motion would be due pass as amended and refer to the Committee on Appropriations.
2987	Nielsen	Jim	68	GIcgVGMKBjg	1397	1420	They're going to fund it out of existing sources I understand and is reported to be doubling its size of numbers of the employees. That money will come from fines on water users, diverters, people who take water and divert it from a stream even if they have the right to that water.
2988	McGuire	Mike	93	aMmnutMx8lk	300	326	If Henry Trione had not lived, Annadel would be a subdivision. It was the establishment of a critical and absolutely magnificent piece of land right in the middle of an urban area, long before that was even considered important. During the budget crisis in 2012, when state parks were closing down, Henry Trione was the one who personally provided the majority of the funds needed to keep Annadel State Park open and thriving.
2989	Melendez	Melissa	41	7f5uDPxTBXo	753	767	Under AB 1014 the penalty for filing a false petition is a simple misdemeanor, it's a slap on the hand. Knowing the long lasting effects of a GBRO and what it will hold against an individual, I think the punishment does not fit the crime.
2990	Chu	Kansen	32	F69ZqGovNMY	421	447	It has been very useful to hear about how those federal monies, federal grant are used to provide services to low income Californians and their families in a way that is responsive to specific local needs as well as to dire circumstances. Like the drought that are faced by the entire state.
2991	Hernandez	Ed	103	7vLzhqaEeV8	629	642	I thought I heard somebody from there, and that was a concern because I've authored bills in the past that were meant to ensure that hospitals can't use contractual provisions to hide costs for other services. So explain to me what you meant.
2992	Leno	Mark	60	bq30nlpq090	1385	1407	But all about fifty billion dollars worth of income revenue that the state doesn't doesn't realize in the result of accident  expenditures each year. At what point. would the OLA suggest you've really gotta look at this? Because this is a balloon that just keeps expanding.
2993	De Leon	Kevin	102	dPeGakg4w7Y	49	67	Los Angeles, as you all know, is one of the most congested transportation corridors in the country and with the projected population growth of more than one and a half million people in the next 30 years, we can assume that congestion will only worsen, unless investments are made to improve quality and mobility.
2994	Achadjian	K.H. "Katcho"	5	Rt-g3tEX78Q	1150	1166	Madame Speaker, I am pleased to present HR6, which will recognize February 28th 2015 as rare disease in California. There are 7,000 diseases that are considered rare. While each disease affects only a limited number of individuals, the impact on the American population is on the other the significant.
2995	Chavez	Rocky	83	B6r57uGOz9Y	194	217	I can figure they're not good, which goes to the other slide you have here when you're talking about single parents, 95.3 women, 3.8 men that's really shocking. Having been a single parent myself, as a male and seeing that just really strikes me.
2996	Atkins	Toni	110	Rt-g3tEX78Q	1208	1250	Thank you. I'll take that as your close. Seeing no other members to speak can we open the role for co-authors? All those who wish to vote to be added his co-authors please vote. Okay, tally the role. 71 co-authors are added. Members, we can take a voice vote on file item one. All those in favor say aye. Opposed? The motion carries.
2997	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	z_QlsHBgTk4	1295	1313	That didn't happen. That didn't happen because people became myopic in a kind of me, me, where's my money kinda attitude, or just don't want it. And there's nothing, absolutely nothing, no matter how you bend over backwards, to satisfy them.
2998	Chavez	Rocky	83	dpByeg5zAi8	1288	1306	And what this also does, this bill requires the school districts to offer a professional growth or remediation plan to a certif, certificate employee who's received evaluation rating ineffective or has received 2 consecutive evaluations at minimal effective.
2999	Chiu	David	7	UFmCagPc99I	271	281	Thank you for your presentation. Let me first ask colleagues, any questions to the panelists? I do have a follow-up question to Dr. Chavez. And first let me say thank you to the LAO.
3000	Hueso	Ben	48	tINh4PHsxqM	875	897	There are others that employ under the workers independent contractors model, they have been challenged. Some have found to actually, when their independent contractors have been found to actually have an employee business relationship.
3001	Lara	Ricardo	107	GC6hApRO4Yg	1667	1683	Thank you, Madame President and members. Just briefly I want to thank our Pro Tem for leading the charge on such an important issue. When it comes to U.S. citizen children that itself been deported with their families. When you deport the breadwinner, you know, you essentially deport the entire family.
3002	Wolk	Lois	94	D2hWZq64n8Q	880	898	The change in direction from the NCCP permit to a biological opinion permit essentially, how does that affect the implementation of the Delta Reform Act? So I'm looking at governance financing oversight of this project.
3003	Allen	Benjamin	70	MpQ4SGzO7GE	320	341	I've got a few questions. First of all, I, I it seems to be just a lot of, I'm having a hard time under, I, I heard all the wonderful folks who came up and spoke. I am, I'm having a really hard time seeing how this bill impacts individual home share folks like the people who came up to speak.
3004	Thurmond	Tony	4	NlzNfy_j0A8	1532	1543	 Thank you. Any questions from the committee? Seeing none, if you would take us through the proposed trailer bill language for the pilot, or for community replacement plan funding?
3005	Patterson	Jim	119	jAVMxyN_c9U	141	163	Thank you Mr. Speaker and members. I really want to echo those who have suggested we have to be very careful about how this is done. Taking the tour of the independent systems operator the first-year I was here and then the second-year I was here.
3006	Pavley	Fran	104	GeGPm9PK4o0	6	26	As Chair of the Natural Resources and Water Committee, I think it's very important that we review an amazing report that came in, in an independent science study, but let me begin with thanking you all for coming. And this is a two-hour hearing, it'll end at about 11:00.
3007	Dababneh	Matthew	50	NEf6zh-NPIY	1799	1813	They said this program had run a deficit every year. They said this program wouldn't benefit workers because it actually cost jobs in the state. None of that seems to have panned out. We have a surplus. I've also worked in the children's hospital.
3008	McGuire	Mike	93	LuelkxPlWfo	651	672	By signing both the privacy form, as well as the terms of service form, you have signed away your privacy and the privacy of guests. In, in addition, vacation rental platforms are already providing the federal government with extremely sensitive information on their hosts via mandated 1099-K forms.
3009	Nguyen	Janet	65	1E-hERPJ9VM	1048	1073	Okay. Yeah, because we've done many in my district. When I was a county supervisor we would go into the school district and the under served areas, and we would have, it's actually, sometimes we have the dental van. Other times we just have, there's actually these mobile ones where you can carry it.
3010	Rodriguez	Freddie	69	VkWyifymNDY	877	887	The system has never developed to the capacity of providing this information. There are many things that we can do better to develop the system that we can locate 911 wireless callers.
3011	Nguyen	Janet	65	lA7lgET9urw	361	371	so I seek your input on the distribution of the cost increases that we are seeing and how we can contain these costs in a manner that will not affect our residents.
3012	De Leon	Kevin	102	LhZTpLi6UbE	1717	1732	Thank you so much. Okay, I want to thank our appointees; those folks who were in support of Mrs. Husari or Mr. Wade, please come on up, please come on up.
3013	Pavley	Fran	104	M0MScnK_2Tc	684	702	The court also decides many other factors, but this is a legal way to decide who gets how much water and who are the rightful property-right owners on that particular basin. It's complicated. I think the big winners in the adjudication process are the lawyers.
3014	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	Y13vuRnCz5Y	1240	1257	And, I would like to ask whether and, then asked the authors to respond. But since you're here representing the oncologist, you know, these are people who deal with death and dying on a daily basis.
3015	Block	Marty	59	RJGZrXESD6M	120	134	SB 13 deals with pre-emptory challenges. It increases efficiencies in jury selection by reducing the number of pre-emptory challenges only in misdemeanor trials from 10 to 6 per side.
3016	Wieckowski	Bob	55	WSuppHjpCKY	1611	1624	Then the concept is that it's not a fraudulent conveyance but it is a pre-petition planning that the debtors have moved money into the value of the house to reduce it.
3017	Hertzberg	Robert	99	898OiW72jWg	122	153	But, if you're gonna look and you well know by virtue of your expertise as an accountant in this space, you've gotta analyze all costs. I certainly saw this in my world as the time I was out of government. But, when you have a private sector, folks, you got a whole process to be able to do bids. And then you have bid protests, and you have time delays, and you have litigation. And you have exposure to a whole hosts of costs that, when you look at the balance sheet, it seems to me, that when you're gonna look at trying to deliver those services, you should look at that.
3018	Cooper	Jim	21	6gxr39Gyjlk	21	38	The DMV Pull Notice Program helps businesses and government agencies ensure that unsafe drivers are taken off the road quickly by notifying employers when an enrolled participant is involved in an accident, convicted of driving under the influence, or any other actions taken against their driving privileges.
3019	Nguyen	Janet	65	lA7lgET9urw	234	248	Health care reform made many promises. However, Californians have not only seen through an expanded coverage, mostly through Medi-Cal, therefore this hearing on Making Health Care Affordable is timely and extremely necessary.
3020	Alejo	Luis	9	dAMeavSqnLk	215	225	This bill passed at the Senate Floor with bipartisan support and joint support of several co-authors who represent Monterey and Sacramento counties. I respectfully ask for an aye vote on this marvelous bill.
3021	Huff	Bob	105	BmeSyindq90	706	729	We spend over half of our general fund budget on education when you factor in higher education KTwelve everything it's a huge investment, and yet what we focus on mostly is not output, but how much we're putting into it. To that point one of your first things you talked about was staff and faculty factors should be weighed most heavily because teachers are the fulcrums of schools.
3022	Dababneh	Matthew	50	6G5U2kPEBw0	1528	1545	Thank you Mr Alanis. I will say.In your comments on the EMV override and the system, Ms McGreevy if you could touch on something that he pointed out, that how will this affect online commerce and internet sales as well with the new system.
3023	Grove	Shannon	77	R3SMzNAvRKs	1101	1114	They didn't get the funding in the very beginning on time, and so the organization that founded these charter schools used their money from the organization to put them into the school so it would succeed and survive.
3024	Weber	Shirley	44	8YNqtXYvNaM	939	955	Obviously, this is gonna be held over for additional conversation, but I think we should look at this as a situation where whatever we do will be ongoing. That we will have to address the issue of the trucks eventually. But I never try to look at resources as being so exclusive.
3025	Burke	Autumn	6	DT3707YnrIQ	667	687	By expanding CalCAP, the program funded by our cap and trade resources, can reach communities and consumers that may never have been able to reduce their carbon footprint or energy, without a little help. With AB 1393, we'll be able to partner with financial institutions to invest in cleaner, smarter communities for all. I respectfully request your aye vote.
3026	Hill	Jerry	66	s0a4gZFkKY4	1568	1578	 Thank you very much. Others, anyone else in opposition to the bill? Seeing no one. We will bring it back to the committee for questions. Comments for--yes. Senator Mendoza?
3027	Hall	Isadore	1	31W9cfaQWLY	55	88	As the non violent protesters across the bridge they were confronted by Alameda state troopers, Alabama state troopers who brutally attacked and beat some even to death. Americans across the country witnessed this massacre as news stations broadcast this vicious brutality live on television.
3028	Daly	Tom	118	WYVxOJwtXj8	1529	1548	Then I think a modern governance structure will work better, similar to the OCTA in Orange County, the transportation authority, and many other joint county-city bodies some of which have five members, or seven members. So I appreciate you, the time today. And I respectfully request an aye vote.
3029	Ting	Philip	30	Q9Mn4k8Lves	691	705	Again, it creates a little bit more openness so that when we have our precious community colleges and they're threatened, that we have an opportunity to speak in public, that we have an opportunity to hear them deliberate in public, which is really all we ask of any public agency.
3030	Stone	Jeff	26	TrPgAQvjTc0	735	770	SB32 will require greenhouse gas emissions be reduced to 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. It also authorizes interim targets for 2030 and 2040, but California chamber, representing businesses from Chico down to Calexico from Santa Barbara to Mono county has dubbed SB32 yet another job killer for the State of California.
3031	Hancock	Loni	98	Lv2k4fcWClc	632	647	Well, at some point, you're absolutely right. It's an assessment issue and then the question is how that overlaps with issues of privacy and rehabilitation and a fresh start?
3032	Stone	Jeff	26	uk0vIxtVZmg	71	84	We have a horrific drought that exists today, it's gonna exist tomorrow, it's gonna exist three months from now. Hopefully we'll get some rain this winter, but what we're handling, this is a one size fit all.
3033	Stone	Mark	20	1l8Sm-QNSvU	913	925	California having our own brand of poverty needs our own brand of solution, and that is why we've proposed and earned income tax credit. The analysis, and I appreciate the analysis, raises some very good questions and one of which is, why now?
3034	Perea	Henry	33	hGRwdCC6_e8	1016	1024	Mr. Speaker and members, AB617 to it's going to make it easier for California to meet ground water goal passed by the sustainable ground water managements act last year.
3035	Beall	Jim	92	_3f-5R48ZaU	762	788	CC Myers, okay, very famous for the work they did in emergency repairs of the collapse of the Bay Bridge. You went through a process with that to fix the bridge in a very rapid way. What wasn't too much told was the fact that it costs a lot of money.
3036	McCarty	Kevin	22	9-tqw489jZ4	1662	1681	academic success, preventing kids from entering the juvenile justice system, and fighting poverty. Unfortunately every year tens of thousands of kids are left behind and don't have access to either a traditional kindergarten, Head Start, or state preschool program. This bill attempts to address that. Preschool prepares children to be ready for successful in life.
3037	Nguyen	Janet	65	oFD3dFY_sMo	1551	1563	Well, you understand why I made up the number. It's a lot easier to understand, if you were given a $1,000 a month. And then $1500 to work full time as a parent, as an adult, you would choose welfare.
3038	Leyva	Connie	62	_JbASqkciSI	1275	1299	Thank you, Mr. Chair. I would just say thank you for the opportunity to be here. I've been told as a new legislator we should not fall in love with our bills and I am not in love with this bill, but I am in strong like of it because I think that it really helps small businesses, which we have so, so many in California and it puts them on equal footing with bigger businesses who have more resources. So, thank you for hearing me and I respectfully ask for an aye vote.
3039	Stone	Jeff	26	Tb_ZR86SMpk	306	371	Thank you Madam President. I rise in opposition SB 572. I think this is a local control issue. I think is a former local elected official. One of things that we don't like is when the state tells us what to do with the federal government tells us that do when we see our constituents on a weekly/bi-weekly basis and hear their concerns why would we want to preempt any decision that a local school board would have. They have meetings, they are subject to the Brown Act there has to be a compelling reason why they be closing a school down, probably declining enrollment, consolidating with other schools to better spend their money. I think this is meddling I don't think we should be meddling and local governments responsibilities in place yet another mandate on them. Let's set the school boards though, I think is the best for their constituents, their students. Let's let them make the decisions on behalf of the taxpayers in that area and promoting good education and let's not meddle into their affairs. I urged a no vote on SB 572.
3040	Chiu	David	7	xdTTK0YoutY	598	614	Colleague, seeing and hearing no further action, Assembly Member Campos has asked for an aye vote. The clerk will open the roll. All those who vote who desire to vote. All those who vote who desire to vote. All those who vote who desire to vote.
3041	Bates	Pat	58	WbtRyMk2fD8	1361	1385	There's a motion, any other comments? Members, I am going to lay off the bill today. I now have- Oh, sorry, I have the mic. Here we go. It had turned itself off. Does that mean it doesn't wanna hear me? Probably. Anyway, I think we need you to do a little more work, in terms of some evidence showing anti-protocol so
3042	Bonta	Rob	85	sO4d30mS8eM	1147	1161	Thank you Mr. Chair. Mr. McCarty, I just wanna thank you for your leadership and your passion, and your commitment on this issue in bringing AB 47 forward. We obviously have a tremendous need in California to strengthen our early childhood education programs throughout the state, and this is a bold measure.
3043	Jones	Brian	42	D1U0Ojzunqk	567	595	And I represent a rural community too. We have a little bit of this, obviously not to the extent that you do. But it is completely appalling to me that of the lack of leadership in California on the environmental aspect of this. When California, we uphold ourselves as being on the front lines, the forefront in protecting the environment.
3044	Quirk	Bill	23	nJsCwYpjBcE	1255	1287	Thank you very much. Then I will make my recommendation. So, first of all I agree with most of what we set up here, both in support and opposition, with Member Gonzalez, with Member Jone-Sawyer. My concern about this bill is I don't think it has the right approach to protecting the families, to protecting officers against rape and kidnapping.
3045	Cooper	Jim	21	JX3K3k4qzkE	261	273	The bill adds examples of security officer duties to assure individuals, employed by a business such as a bar or a restaurant and who provide security services, are not unlicensed. Additionally proposed amendments are intended to clarify the definition of work week for private companies.
3046	Gordon	Richard	117	skOoMkG_5XA	1160	1178	Yes, thank you Mr. Chairman; appreciate the the conversation about this issue. There's been some suggestion by the opposition that you know, we ought to wait and see what Covered California does. I would remind you that Covered California affects almost 2,000,000 Californians.
3047	Hancock	Loni	98	dv1TuQD9iKk	126	142	And I understand that you have a proposal from the NAACP... about how we can look at that in a more systemic way and figure out not to have that happen, and I'm wondering if you could talk about it.
3048	Mathis	Devon	75	wyPJESdYFaE	1373	1414	When you started out you were talking about there's a difference between say younger populations with disabilities needing long-term care and we often overlook that and look more at the aging populations. As far as insurance packages things moving forward in your professional opinion would you see it better suited to have something more towards like younger populations with disabilities versus aging populations and have different plans because a lot of times things get mixed up. I'm the father of two special needs children. So I've been dealing with this since birth with one and since age three-and-a-half with another.  So in your professional opinion sir.
3049	Thurmond	Tony	4	8M2h8_iX1Ao	1156	1167	First and foremost, I also wanna offer my thanks to everyone who's testified today especially for those individuals who testified for family members who they've lost or for themselves.
3050	Chiu	David	7	sR3YZBZSyxQ	1150	1164	Seeing and hearing no further debate, the clerk will open the roll. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote.  The clerk will close the roll, tally the votes, ayes 72, nos 0, measure passes.
3051	De Leon	Kevin	102	YGvsvPIzjxQ	106	129	With the passage of SB 967 in 2014, which established an affirmative consent standard, the first application of the Yes Means Yes in the country, California took steps, proactive steps, to aid college age women in addressing the issue of college assault and violence. However, we can not be satisfied with the implementation of SB 967.
3052	Hernandez	Ed	103	dCf0VaDDxwk	142	162	the fact that we have been underfunded in Medi-Cal and DDS for way too long. It was a brave move on his behalf and I am particularly pleased because there are issues that I have been talking about for close to 8 years. Many individuals may not know this, but the amount a physician gets paid for
3053	Stone	Jeff	26	pIm79elnbMQ	1503	1519	So it's even higher. So since that contract is coming up, would it not be appropriate, when we're dealing with Los Angeles to give them the option to let the state take over that responsibility at a lower cost, or have them supplant the difference of what it would've cost the State of California to do the same.
3054	De Leon	Kevin	102	E7bFLC4httQ	43	65	Fantastic, we've established a quorum. Why don't we go to file item number one. That is Mr. Gareth Elliot, I see a name tag for him. We have a speaker Emeritus John Perez, John A Perez. And Mr. Eloy Oakley as well. However, I do not see- There is a spelling error. There is a spelling error. Okay, all right.
3055	Patterson	Jim	119	nZglKWPAZEc	502	521	to some degree where a lot of Californians can't afford, the cost of living in California. Some of that has to do with well intentioned policies that contribute to a very high surcharge of price of living in the State of California, and I think there's got to be a very serious balancing act between those
3056	Olsen	Kristin	15	d_EaaILk1VE	81	96	ACA 1 also updates the 30 day in print rule to allow committees to review bills after they have been in print and online for at least 15 days instead of the 30 days currently required, that was established when the legislature first convened in California.
3057	Pavley	Fran	104	Q93W3yN07bU	717	736	We're also looking at an amendment to have a pilot program to speed up a general planned development so that general plans are mainly  advisory or statements of vision but not necessarily have to go through CEQA.
3058	Melendez	Melissa	41	jcqm9XlDQYM	1076	1094	Now, we had an opportunity when we were going through the budget process to allocate money for that community, yet we did not, but we have this bill which seeks to expand a program when we can't even pay for the programs we have in place.
3059	Ting	Philip	30	0xUa-SoTZfU	45	60	I wanted to go back to Professor Griffin's point. And I think our challenge with trying, as we go broader, I think we always want to start from a very broad perspective, as we have two very core issues, that seem to be butting against each other.
3060	Hancock	Loni	98	vEySB-JPx9Q	373	390	Thank you so much, Mr. President. As the joint author of this bill with Senator Anderson, I was proud to be a co-author with him on the same bill last year when it was much more comprehensive.
3061	Cooper	Jim	21	-O56kS7yA2Y	565	580	As we move into the next topic of body-worn cameras, community, and law enforcement goals and objectives, I believe it's important to remember that the use of video surveillance can be effective. But as we have learned, it's not the panacea to improve relationships between the community and law enforcement.
3062	Mitchell	Holly	64	NOpjVjVZw80	7	27	Budget Subcommittee three started. I understand a Republican caucus was called, so we'll be joined shortly by Senator Stone, Senator Monning was called into a meeting with the pro tem, he'll be joining us. But we will go ahead and honor your time and get started. We've got a pretty lengthy agenda today.
3063	Levine	Marc	8	jKVkIx_af_k	556	570	Additionally, this project will include adding a bike lane to the bridge to close a significant gap in the 270 mile Bay Trail. As the committee analysis points out, this bridge was built in 1956 with three lanes in each direction.
3064	Maienschein	Brian	84	ASNmI2rHU9I	1784	1800	And I think, that would be pretty problematic. I, also, am concerned, you know, it was brought up earlier about cost of drugs for other countries. Certainly these, these other countries are operating in circumstances much different than ours.
3065	Wood	Jim	72	k0jwR3_bc5U	910	941	I appreciate your comments. First of all, Prop 215 doesn't cover collectives, though the collectives are the ones making the money, so that just as a point of clarification, from my perspective it with all due respect. So, it is entirely possible that a county that has decided to ban cultivation could establish a program that actually issue zero tags. You could do that.
3066	Maienschein	Brian	84	RFWwgE7ubok	943	965	And certainly to support this author too which I would like to do. But I think this is an area, and you're hearing it on a bipartisan level across this committee, that this is something in particular I guess from the lawyers who have been paying it. That this is, there needs to be substantial changes here.
3067	Wood	Jim	72	h3qpDny4S5o	356	369	And I guess what I would really like to see is an opportunity to collaborate and look at the program more holistically and say you know what this program we could plug all the holes in the boat and it may, you know, the engine may fail or something else.
3068	Beall	Jim	92	-1v9avmnxCY	1047	1062	Basically what you're saying is you have three categories, the around the transit station's a half mile, the senior housing, and the special needs housing. Okay, those are the three categories.
3069	Chavez	Rocky	83	Ks2cqtpLqGI	2208	2281	My last issue is: I'm happy to see that the general fund has $940 million for early childhood education, but if you think about it, in the general fund we're spending $67 billion for education out of general fund. The way we frame this discussion, and we call it childcare, we need for everybody to forget the term childcare. We're not talking about baby-sitting. We're talking about early cognitive development of children and because of the challenges we are having economically in our society, many families that are just barely paying the rent are warehousing children in centers where they are not developing cognitively. So, children are going to school and some kids, like my grandchildren, are going in and they can read and write because I'm able to make sure they have that ability, but it's an economic issue. If young children's parents, because their economic situation, cannot have that quality cognitive development 1 to 5, then those children go to school not prepared.
3070	Grove	Shannon	77	wK5CwGDTeOM	806	816	So they have to go with their buckets down to the center of town or the center of the street, fill their buckets up, and carry it back to their house. That's happening right here in California and has been happening since August.
3071	Hertzberg	Robert	99	r2CpJ7yeI28	548	573	Like for example, I was around when we did AB 32, helping out in certain areas of that, and we went to the Air Resources Board as the institution to be the place to deposit that responsibility. why? Because we propose trusting conference and Mary Nichols will, you know, unless we can keep her working there for a hundred-years, is that the right agency? What diagnostic, what homework have you done to make a determination, is that the best place that we need to go to?
3072	Alejo	Luis	9	yAgUQvRrkrQ	899	921	Including the top leadership, Kevin McCarthy to, let's find the right balance and allow a ballot measure to move forward. 20 years ago, my first visit to the capitol was to protest the inauguration of Governor Pete Wilson in January of 1995 shortly after Prop 187 passed.
3073	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	jSYoUQmoG0c	135	157	Still housing, still our rental housing market is hot. AB 396 does not require housing providers to hold units during any po, point in this process. Furthermore, in, and if another qualified applicant comes along, the housing provider is still within his or her rights to choose that other applicant at any time.
3074	Hill	Jerry	66	UpjsW9YiW28	597	618	That's a very far extreme. And that's why, frankly, the original bill was talked about the Federal Trade Commission standards. You know, they are vague, and they, I don't think that gives anyone a comfort level of some factual basis to move forward with. And 5% just looked at some of those companies that, so that's where 10% to me looks like
3075	Wieckowski	Bob	55	CfbKdUW5Buw	1621	1643	So we, they are complying with the law If their permit is due July, or August of next year, they don't have to submit it right now under current law for renewal until February. So we're saying if this became the law you'd be out of compliance. And there's enough things that are wrong. That I'd like to have some attention done to the effective date.
3076	Bloom	Richard	2	BMNgYibzIuk	1043	1070	I just wanna ditto your remarks, Dr. Weber. Again, this is an extremely important cohort for us to understand and be able to count and with the understanding that there may be some resource expenditure required I don't think we're going to be able to quantify that very well because this is a very transient population.
3077	Frazier	Jim	114	Paz6OIae0eQ	122	144	Who better to ask how things are working or what needs to be fixed than the customers and the experts in their field? We were successful in passing a funding pack if, God I wish that was true though, if we were successful in passing a funding package and believe me we will be, then we must develop a freight program that is sustainable and supports a vibrant economy.
3078	Hernandez	Ed	103	218-RTK66_I	1543	1557	According to the CDE, all 58 of the county officers of education and over 75% of school districts are certified tobacco free, with more than half of California's schools now 100% tobacco free, the Legislature should make it clear.
3079	Block	Marty	59	ljoLf-DKwGg	1347	1372	Okay, show that item passing three, zero. Now we move to the last item on agenda part a, which is educator misconduct. I'd like to invite the same folks back. And we'll begin with Department of Finance.
3080	Hertzberg	Robert	99	akOKQetVqu4	1052	1061	And the point you made about volunteerism is huge in terms of the numbers, I see it, in terms of kids wanting to volunteer an intern. The question is how do we turn it on to us, right?
3081	Mitchell	Holly	64	Mt9BcU600uM	561	573	Thank you very much, Mr. President. I appreciate that. Good afternoon again. Thank you for bringing some time to meet with me,  appreciate it. Good afternoon to you sir.
3082	Dababneh	Matthew	50	eYvHQ6iO6CE	392	410	Many are not that lucky. While this is a complicated situation, I ask for this committee to vote this bill out today to allow us to continue to work with insurance companies, the doctors, the consumer advocacy groups, and, hopefully, many on this committee who would like to add their voice to this discussion.
3083	Baker	Catharine	74	Jfvd2Tinaec	474	493	Thank you, Mr. Chair and fellow, fellow members. Good afternoon. Joint author assemblyman Hadley and I are pleased to present to you today AB 1048. AB 1048 repeals the limit or cap on school district budget reserves that was instituted through last year's budget trailer language.
3084	Anderson	Joel	57	E_gAhll2czw	679	712	Even more knew him as a devoted father and grandfather, as well as a dedicated and loyal navy officer. Dale survived by his wife Mable, his sister Wayona Holt, his children Dale, Paul, Dennis, Regina, Mora, Marianne, Katie, Bridget, Douglas, 18 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. Dale with a man of strong faith who loved this family, who served our country with distinction and honor. We who knew him will always remember him lovingly. Dale Helmer go with God, may your soul rest in peace, thank you.
3085	Liu	Carol	63	imNDOA_EHUU	32	46	Was that, that bill was. I know, but we didn't have a motion. Did we have a motion on that bill? No. We didn't. Okay, so we need a motion on the- Thank you. Bill has been moved to-
3086	Gallagher	James	108	OqtPmd4MeNE	670	694	They never asked to be part of the story, but unfortunately they are. And so I think it's only right that when someone's gonna go out and sell their story, or sell their rights to a story, that the other people who never wanted to be part of that story, wished they'd never had this happen to them and their family. That they have some say and some ability to be notified of that and to, and to act accordingly.
3087	Stone	Jeff	26	LrUb6Z3dcdU	1363	1387	I think that there's a lot of fear that if they leave the system, they have to fight to get back in the system. So there needs to be some process, stream-line process, that if for any reason, they maybe they take a job, that may be too challenging for them at that point in time, that they can get back into the program quickly. And have the assurances that they get back in the program quickly.
3088	Galgiani	Cathleen	95	4l5FjBTBUZQ	1228	1242	should embrace this opportunity to provide serious consequences for criminals looking to use date rape drugs to facilitate a heinous crime against someone who is incapacitated by that drug. Thank you and I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
3089	Wood	Jim	72	JVAurJ3HeDI	924	948	Thank you very much Chair and members. Thank you for the opportunity to present AB 243 today. This bill, through an excise tax on medical marijuana cultivators, will provide resources to mitigate some of the negative effects of the cultivation of marijuana. It will protect the environment, provide additional resources to local law enforcement, and create a grant program for environmental cleanup of illegal cultivation sites.
3090	Baker	Catharine	74	Jfvd2Tinaec	590	609	And these are, are costs that for many school districts can wipe out their entire reserve in a single year. It's something that, it frankly is of great concern to our districts now because it's something that can kick in right away. There's been an understanding that this cap on reserves won't kick in for several years down the road.
3091	McCarty	Kevin	22	B_DlPPzaBGc	1240	1265	There are nearly five hundred million PACE projects in California, but it can be expanded extremely allocated more revenue such as an opportunity increase, the loan loss reserve program here in California through cap and trade revenues, or focusing on incentive-based efforts like we see with alternative zero-based, or zerio emissions cars.
3092	Stone	Jeff	26	N91f_wLf7XI	501	528	I think it's fair to say that our county representatives, if there was enough money to extend the program to four years, you would probably be very supportive of that I would imagine, as long as we had the items that you suggested as recommended: repeal the maximum family grant, increase grant levels, bring back the earned income tax credit.
3093	Mayes	Chad	79	2cybSlRCgP0	515	527	And one more question. We're talking about the budget, and that the fact that the Governor has had this language in the trailer bill, moving forward. But doesn't the Governor have to sign this bill for it to become law?
3094	De Leon	Kevin	102	BHYxE3t9U1s	58	91	We're going to bring you up if you want to say anything, if there's any family members, if you have any family members here today. I want to make sure that we acknowledge any family members who have come up. I know that, you have a personal issue that you have to get to urgently, so I don't want you to spend a lot of time during the interviews with staff as well as interviews with the members themselves, folks feel very confident about you. But if there are any family members that you have with you today, I want to make sure that we give them an opportunity to recognize.
3095	Pan	Richard	96	uUsytMtXn1I	806	830	Okay. And, I guess the other question I have is because what this bill says is that you can't use the blood spots are identified by DNA and for example there are developments of new technologies for newborn screenings. So actually at UC Davis, they were looking at blood gas cromotography some other techniques.
3096	De Leon	Kevin	102	_C-l6C8Fln0	1567	1598	We're almost there too. I want to also point of personal privilege, we have with us today the former Pro Tem of the California State Senate, former treasurer, former Attorney General. That is Mr. Senate Pro Tem, because again once a Senator, always a Senator. We won't recognize him as former Attorney General or former treasurer, we're going to always recognize him as a Senate Pro Tem, Senator Bill Larkin.
3097	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	QZvfELCftBU	314	334	But invading our privacy and property without permission or legal authority should not be one of them. Just as I can't walk into your backyard without your permission, I shouldn't be able to fly my drone in your back yard, while you're enjoying the outdoors with your family. This is not just an issue for home owners.
3098	Fuller	Jean	49	A1UTGLmNv2E	362	391	A quorum is present. Would the members and our guests beyond the rail and in the gallery, please rise. We will be led in prayer this morning by our guest chaplain Rabbi Ruven, mosaic law congregation Sacramento. After which please remain standing, we will be lead in the pledge of allegiance to the flag by Senator Vidak.
3099	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	RFWwgE7ubok	66	90	And again, the responsibility of the bar as we know is to protect the public. And one of the ways that we protect the public is to make sure that people are not holding themselves to the practice of law who should not be. And for me, personally, I think this is a critically important component of the bar's activities. I had the good fortune, or misfortune, of practicing law for over 22 years.
3100	Obernolte	Jay	86	GxQLQjba08A	941	953	Okay thank you. I have a couple questions for the CPUC. I'm wondering if you'll agree with the LAO's contention that the document that you provided to the Legislature was not a zero based budget.
3101	Weber	Shirley	44	SuJy5eE040k	1278	1291	And rather than putting it out for grants to come in at some of the levels. But they did have leave 20 million just to phase down the 40, that was the general thinking. Phase it down to 20, and then phase it out completely.
3102	Hertzberg	Robert	99	gDPCmEU7pmg	1878	1892	5-0, we'll hold it open for the members. Thank you very much Assemblywoman Brown. It's always good having you. Okay, next up. AB 204, right? AB 204. Assemblymember O'Donnell, from the great area of Long Beach.
3103	Mitchell	Holly	64	L-zMn7PZXCE	521	548	While I appreciate the robust discussion on my home county, I also want to make sure that The State Department is clear that while that is, that's a contract negotiation, that's a very important issue, we're also clear that you have a direct responsibility and oversight over a very broken system statewide right now. So I don't want us to get caught up in this conversation and lose the bigger picture, which is our,
3104	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	R2eb9EMkWP0	703	716	So is that the impedi- cuz I agree. I'm going to support this bill, and if you don't want to take an amendment that excises the attorneys' fees, cuz I think you've reduced them by virtue of this-
3105	Hill	Jerry	66	670ewxdSqNM	1629	1666	We will now move to the fourth, panel, Educational Institution Efforts to Assist Corinthian Students, please come forward. We have Paul Feist, Vice Chancellor of Communications Community College Chancellor's Office. Michael Cunningham, PhD Chancellor National University System President, National University, and Todd Erickson, Vice Provost, Enrollment and Strategic Initiatives for William Jessup University. Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you for your participation today.  Mr. Feist you are up  First?
3106	Hancock	Loni	98	Oc8_cozASuQ	1325	1354	Right. I think we want all the parties involved and specific recommendations are helpful as well. You should probably say that we will be reconvening the hearing at 1:30. I invite all of you back again, and actually, to the extent that some of the panelists can be here too so they can comment later, this is all very helpful to us right now. Thank you.
3107	Leno	Mark	60	R0xKhCYzBZA	213	233	though may not, because of their own timeline of their projects, be able to get their EIR certified by the end of 2013 which is the date in the current AB900 law to be able to have the calendar year of 2016 to complete their EIR certification.
3108	Fuller	Jean	49	iXqi4cKnhU8	806	837	Very good discussion on security.  And I feel that you are very qualified.  And the only question I have for the, through the public today is what additional types of new business services or innovations do you foresee of the tech providing in the near future?  Just very briefly, maybe more about what we end-users we'll get to do than about the specific technology.
3109	Bates	Pat	58	9eA3HqZp1ws	1684	1699	Thank you, Madame President. Members, I rise this afternoon to ask that the Senate adjourn in the memory of Jerry Lynn Salyer of Oceanside, quite a beloved member of that community. He was just 61 when he passed away on January 30.
3110	Jones	Brian	42	dfinQbvsuZo	686	696	Thank you Mr. Speaker and Members. I rise to present AB 1383 and I ask for your aye vote. 1383 will establish a voluntary preference for employers to grant a veteran in hiring.
3111	De Leon	Kevin	102	YGvsvPIzjxQ	226	244	Therefore, it is very important for young people to be exposed to this information in as many venues as possible, especially in schools, so we can empower young men and women, and especially men, young men, to create and develop and sustain healthy relationships between them and their peers.
3112	Dahle	Brian	47	AY2GGpXPzCw	940	958	Seeing no other witnesses in opposition, bring it back to our members. We do have a motion by Mr. Stone. Do we have a second for the bill? We have a second by Mr. Rendon. Okay questions by members? Seeing none, would you like to close?
3113	Grove	Shannon	77	xhI7BgS1JK0	1237	1263	So I look at insurance and I think that they price their product or agree to insure that product based on risk. I understand that you're using the Section 8 issue in the low income housing and all that, but I mean insurance companies price Section 8 housing as a risk just like they price the guy that drives a McLaren or a DeLorean that has two speeding tickets. He's more apt of a liability risk than you or I driving down the road.
3114	Low	Evan	11	QkQlxH8U7IE	1845	1872	And so the language, when posting for the job opportunity is very clear that, when focused on area in terms of internet posting, or posting on paper. Whatever promotional material, specifically, no discrimination. It's specifically outlining that of previously have worked for an agency before. That's where it clarifies that issue. So, to answer your question, interest of issue at hand, it's specifically to the language at hand in the publications.
3115	Bates	Pat	58	uKMBP4F7FFc	374	396	Ultimately the cost to lock up offenders for a long period of time is minor in relation to the lives that we've already lost due to the existing statute and the lack of tools for law enforcement to take appropriate action. The families of these victims are paying the highest price in the death of their loved ones, therefore it is imperative that criminals with these intents are held accountable,
3116	Alejo	Luis	9	99NWh04_JOI	10	24	Thank you Mr. Chair and committee members. I'm here as a joint author of AB 684, joint author with Assemblymember Susan Bonilla. And I'm also the author of AB 595 to urge your support of this measure.
3117	Quirk	Bill	23	mNQQzzy6ePQ	771	802	I think there was an excellent close, which I agree with. Something that everyone who had who spoke today agrees on is that this should be a felony. Theft of a handgun. So we all agree on that now. The representative of the District Attorney is telling me now that things are in fact that is now more difficult to call this a felony, that in courts they are now calling it a misdemeanor.
3118	Lopez	Patty	89	ufpnr2TGLO8	128	147	Thank you Mr. Chair and as a former pardon I am glad to hold in this hearing today. I know for the first hand the struggle that foster youth have in our community and in the schools. And I would like to thank the panelists for taking the time today to present this important issue
3119	Williams	Das	12	79bMZ-eNloc	1220	1251	And that does not just effect Montecito because I articulated, that means then there's a demand for water to be stolen from our adjoining jurisdiction. So that means the entire south coast is affected as of Santa Barbara county as one jurisdiction tries to stop people from trucking water into a place where there's enough money where people can pay for it.
3120	Bonta	Rob	85	DJsU22tiuNg	1741	1753	Yes. I want to thank all the stake holders for their engagement in this process and commitment to the core fundamental component of this bill, which is to protect the patient, as you have so eloquently outlined.
3121	Bloom	Richard	2	KKyvS4cSSIw	672	693	If I might just follow up very briefly, I appreciate the responses each of which was somewhat different from the other. I would just say I think it's important that we set goals, as we have with the 98% level here, but set goals on this other metric as well.
3122	Melendez	Melissa	41	8AAoooSnIWE	512	523	and that was because they had, you know, built a new shelter and of course the everyone has to buy in. and that doesn't change the fact that it's $800,000 a year for a small city to pay for an animal shelter.
3123	Wieckowski	Bob	55	GC6hApRO4Yg	905	918	I'm sorry my mic was not on. On second thought, Madam President, I would ask that we will move the bar pilots act of 2015 to the inactive file.
3124	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	Z0exSkj14Bo	930	958	We have old systems. We have sort of a mindset that is let's leave things as they are while we're pushing to try to make things better and yet the technology just doesn't fit. Whether it's because, as Senator Leno pointed out, we have a system in place that almost requires us to deal with these huge companies that move at the speed of maple syrup in winter.
3125	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	Fotikfq9Ybo	1667	1677	Or, if we've lost our privacy, is there any way we can get it back? I don't know what the answer is, but certainly we need we need to have that discussion.
3126	Hernandez	Ed	103	o6dY6yB1_H8	2452	2468	Yes, I would. And we all agree that this is a very vulnerable population. But most importantly it's for individuals or parents who don't have the resources to be able to give these most vulnerable children the services. So, we understand that there's a lot of work to be done.
3127	Dababneh	Matthew	50	gCJqYiGvi7w	842	859	I actually really appreciate the chair of this committee for helping us come up with a reasonable timeframe. I don't think three years and three months is a rush, but I do think within the day, we should have the goal of implementing a product that allows our constituents across the state
3128	Garcia	Eduardo	38	HZaArTsCL5U	1350	1371	Mr. Speaker. I have the great honor and privilege to introduce a very special person, Becky Chavez. Becky Chavez is here. She is the daughter of Richard Chavez, Cesar's youngest brother. As a young girl in Delano she witnessed her father, her uncle, and others others build the United Farm Workers Movement.
3129	Monning	Bill	25	Y13vuRnCz5Y	1731	1756	Just a reminder this status quo in California we have already established a right it is practiced in hospice care, paliative care ,end-of-life care. That it is the law the State of California that a patient using an advanced directive can direct the physician to hasten death by not extending life.
3130	Levine	Marc	8	MlSwdKqMUx4	920	959	Excellent presentations so, thank you for being engaged and continuing that engagement through very difficult years we've had and hopefully very positive years with your participation to come. At this point this morning we will move to public comment. There is a microphone at the front of the room for you to speak in.  There will hopefully be, I would expect, some great public comment. I'd like to provide for two minutes of public comment for each participant and, please be mindful that there are other people behind you that would also like to speak. So mindful of that time. Thank you.
3131	De Leon	Kevin	102	smXlkYaEapc	422	442	And I do personally believe that both of you are very good people and of very good values. You've entered into an environment, a dynamic that is extremely challenging, very challenging. Especially with the heightened media sensitivity and a whole variety of issues.
3132	Gaines	Ted	24	zqM_Vy0kspE	2288	2297	But, it's really a problem, you're talking about efficiency, you're talking about oil changes that are supposed to occur at 10,000 miles and they're not occurring in the real world at least in this case.
3133	Ting	Philip	30	GYqLytCM9KA	272	294	This is a unique opportunity to get federal farm bill dollars. We're already behind because the State of Washington already got $6 million in matching grants, so by moving this bill forward will get an opportunity to really make sure that California gets every dollar it is owed from the federal government for our low income communities who can get access to fresh fruits and vegetables. Thank you. I respectfully ask for an aye vote.
3134	Wieckowski	Bob	55	heZIL8I4UGg	141	162	After Professor Frank, we will hear ... I'd like to have our second speaker, Terry Rivasplata, of the Association of Environmental Professionals, and that will be followed by our third speaker in today's agenda, Christopher Calfee who's with the Governor's Office of Planning. Good morning Professor.
3135	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	IRk3z3ZISoY	173	213	While the state's overall wage gap is slightly lower than the national wage gap of 78 to the dollar, the persistent disparity In earning still has a significant impact on the economic security and welfare of millions of working women and their families. Indeed it is estimated that we leave, women leave 33.6 billion dollars a year on the table because of inequities in pay. That would feed a lot of children, clothe them, house them, and particularly for lower income women, that is the difference between providing good quality lives for the families or not.
3136	Bates	Pat	58	E1_HgghcmCU	1705	1729	So don't disadvantage one to advantage the other, vice versa. They both should have an opportunity to survive and we can't over-regulate them if we really want both industries to be able to survive. So I will be supporting the bill today. I think you guys have gotten a lot of suggestions on where to go and what should be in the study. But, don't kill it now. There's no-
3137	Waldron	Marie	29	1ULf869aoVg	1151	1167	Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise as a proud principle co-author of AB147, which is legislation that enjoys wide bipartisan support. My district and the state at large has many wonderful rescue organizations that stand ready to help these animals in need and help reward these cats and dogs with the brand new life.
3138	Wieckowski	Bob	55	dWQgHfO0lk4	112	130	Because climate change is so slowly, however, even if all greenhouse gas emissions were to cease today, we would have to contend with the ongoing impacts of climate change from our carbon emissions in the past.
3139	Garcia	Eduardo	38	kQ8roglP29M	499	520	Yeah. I just wanted to say thank you for bringing this bill forward Assembly Member Perea. Unfortunately, you know, your area and the area that I represent, Imperial County, compete for some of the worst air quality areas in the State of California. And I think it's appropriate that everyone in our districts have the ability to also drive a clean energy vehicle.
3140	Leno	Mark	60	cmtzGGvG9SA	298	309	We don't disagree. So, we haven't identified exactly what that overall cap would be, but we'll work with them to find it. And that's, while I'm at it I should go over the other points that they raised.
3141	Nielsen	Jim	68	RLVvRo75HJI	1388	1410	If I may, Mr. Chairman. There may be some people that are happy with this proposal, but I think once it is implemented, and there are many aspects of it, this piece here is facilitative of what did somewhat last year and of the last two years with the drought emergency legislation, excuse me.
3142	Atkins	Toni	110	CY8dWb1-gXw	1476	1497	The bill today really is trying to make sure that small and medium size businesses, have the ability to compete as we are looking at tax credits for other industries. Last several years, we've looked at large corporations, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, in terms of the possibility of tax credits to create jobs.
3143	Rendon	Anthony	120	m6dFsAKXJbs	1327	1347	Thank you Mr. Speaker and members. I rise to present SB 48 which adopts several reforms to the Public Utilities Commission. This bill is a part of the Legislature's PUC reform package, which includes my AB 825 and SB 660 by Senators Leno and Hueso. Specifically, SB 48 clarifies that enforcement of open meeting act and
3144	McCarty	Kevin	22	Hi5Vq6PdNIY	1780	1795	So granted, you know, hasn't been a significant increase but it has been an increase. So why hasn't enrollment growth also been able to increase by one percent per year over these years?
3145	Bloom	Richard	2	3I7f3vKVAeA	409	423	You know, we hear a lot about SB 350 that it's going to kill jobs and destroy the state's economy, but it's a fact that California's clean energy and climate policies have helped make our state the seventh largest economy in the world.
3146	Dababneh	Matthew	50	zdfniIDuOwc	164	174	Can you be here in six hours? Can you be here in a day and pick these animals up? And I'm not saying that's necessarily any one institution on this table today but obviously that happens. They've documented it.
3147	Hueso	Ben	48	PLWNz_3ZqZQ	692	731	There will be a process that can be established adminstratively to create a line item account and terms of if we decide to put this Blue Ribbon Committee under the auspices of the Kelly PA, they can kind of establish either a location or a way to charge other departments if larger work is generated to kind of cover that in a way that fulfills some level of their requirement of their organization to create, to fulfull their mission.
3148	Santiago	Miguel	17	eYTxGLtgMco	805	824	So again, we had the, and the reason we structured in the 6% 4% and then the 13 cause we knew we were going in a contract negotiations and we had a 3% that we could work with over 3 years given the COLA adjustments and giving growth money that was coming to the district and, and it would pencil out.
3149	Gaines	Ted	24	SuWeFSpE-9A	81	102	And creates civil immunity for emergency responders who damage a drone that is interfering with emergency response. As this Committee is aware, early in the course of this drought-heightened fire season, private unauthorized drones have repeatedly halted fire fighting efforts.
3150	Gatto	Mike	46	mOH5gnV89FM	550	570	such crimes since its inception about a decade ago. What the court did in the ... decision is it overturned Proposition 69 which was passed by the voters of the state and the court held unconstitutional under California's constitution all of California's DNA collection in the
3151	Gatto	Mike	46	mOH5gnV89FM	535	550	Thank you Mr. Speaker. Just before Christmas last year the California court of appeal dealt a serious blow to anybody who is waiting to solve a crime that could be solved by the help of DNA testing. Of course these crimes are most often rapes and murders and DNA testing has solved over 300,000
3152	Weber	Shirley	44	nugSHhjUz14	1392	1416	We've also adopted a cap and trade plan that built upon the governor's May revision proposal but added 180 million in additional investments in areas like biomass, biosolids, dairy digesters, biodiesel refining, active transit and transit passes. They expect that it will also be a big part of the forthcoming conference discussion with the Senate in the areas that we differ.
3153	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	MVCeSI-m6QA	770	789	They wanted to see if she would lose it. She knew she was being tested, but she passed and her toughness paid off. So once the doubters saw that she could do her job, the thaw was complete and she became like a daughter to them, being significantly younger in years.
3154	Mathis	Devon	75	KbV7aq9eFHo	642	664	Absolutely, once again, members,what this does is goes specifically... What this does is this goes after specifically the back log. The, I mean, there is no debate, you know, you've heard comments today that there's concern over the county veteran service offices, obviously they're in dire need of help as well.
3155	Thurmond	Tony	4	LNIc8kuNihE	786	816	This makes perfect sense but I wanna make sure that, for example, the caseloads that public health nurses are required to maintain will allow them to, in fact, do what is intended. In my limited contact with some of the agencies, it just seems that the caseloads are so high, I wanna make sure that public health nurses will actually be available to help young people navigate the drugs that are being presented to them and if that's been given consideration, caseload sizes.
3156	McCarty	Kevin	22	am7rCfKJLME	381	399	and the Department of Finance to make sure that the proposal works for everybody, works for the CSU, the state, and the local communities, not that there's any visceral opposition out of the gate, but it came with a little bit of uncertainty as far as what it would mean, so I just want to ask that you work with us on that issue.
3157	Dababneh	Matthew	50	_wQgbHlbFh8	1236	1244	And just to follow up, have any other states already passed similar legislation around that foot level that have had a time to be implemented yet, or on that path?
3158	Medina	Jose	81	-F9OB-5fyEQ	545	567	So I agree with Senator Lotta, that it is not a blank check that we give to UC, that the citizens of California also deserve that the money we give to UC be used even fairly. And so that raises questions in my mind on the process, the way that we've been doing it.
3159	Gatto	Mike	46	ch_qINsbUNA	1534	1552	The second component of this bill would provide incentives to homeowners who do wish to remove their lawns. And we all know that removing a lawn is a very responsible thing to do and I think this bill helps homeowners who want to do the right thing. And I respectfully ask for an aye vote.
3160	Roth	Richard	106	Yb_JXmadNgw	2175	2192	So how did that work? So, you sold property to the Redevelopment Agency at a below market rate, to have it developed for affordable housing, and what was gonna be the basis for calculating the money coming back to the city?
3161	Brown	Cheryl	13	HccZsvAseDo	2130	2146	I rise because, Larry Sharp was a member of our community and I really needed to just let you know, adding on to Mr. Stei-- to my colleague from the 40? 45th.
3162	Anderson	Joel	57	_4l4q_6Hap0	1373	1392	So, I'm picking on the assembly woman at this point, but the bottom line is I don't want to create a circumstance where someone's being prosecuted out of ignorance, and we failed them because we're trying to cut a corner.
3163	Hueso	Ben	48	ejG5Ru6MX_o	1357	1376	You know, I think Assemblymember Brown explained it, I guess, the best today. Breaking down silos, that's something that I've been working on in different areas. We have lots of committees and commissions and agencies that don't necessarily work together on common goals.
3164	Harper	Matthew	14	Z5dUcZuiBfw	451	480	Additionally, I think it's important to point out that one thing has happened significantly since this bill was passed just the last year, and that's the referendum. This Legislature, unless this Committee passes this legislation, will not have the opportunity to be able to say whether they agree with the hundreds of thousands who signed the petition to reject this law.
3165	Fuller	Jean	49	pqf8UezhQwo	1772	1786	And if this is the case, why does the bill limit rack sales to newer facilities built on or after January 1st 2016? Shouldn't newer facilities already be considered the most efficient, best equipped technology before being built?
3166	Pavley	Fran	104	FapiTOGMI3c	2021	2044	The audit from the EPA was in 2011. We read about it in 2014 where you can see how much this is costing, frankly the oil companies who are paying for per barrel fee with probably eighty new positions between the Department of Conservation and DOGGR and State Water Board. A lot needs to be done.
3167	Jones	Brian	42	yqnYbnynOzA	997	1019	I'd like to see some compare and contrast on that. On the on the measles outbreak I'm not familiar with it. Obviously you said it was eradicated in 2000 in California. Can you describe, what is the, what is the measles? What does it look like when you have it? and what's the prognosis once you have it?
3168	Hueso	Ben	48	Ydll29eHOng	1240	1258	She helped advance that group's goal in making life a better experience for seniors who also were very poor, didn't have access to a lot of the basic necessities that people take for granted
3169	Hill	Jerry	66	XrOqCob7jCo	1136	1152	Thank you Mr. Chair, this bill is important, necessary. It changes federal law and we appreciate your vote. This is Andy Foster, the executive director of the commission who's here and is doing such an outstanding job. That's why this is such a good-looking bill today.
3170	Chau	Ed	116	z7GYIGDOm-s	93	112	Absolutely. Thank you again, Mr. Chair and members I'm here to present AB 161, the bill will establish a title protection for athletic trainers. Currently, anyone can label himself or herself as an athletic trainer without the proper education, training, or certification.
3171	Irwin	Jacqui	16	ufpnr2TGLO8	229	257	the proper placement because it can completely change trajectories. From going into, basically, jail to having a great education and being able to move forward in life. And I think it's very important that we look at how we can increase the odds for these most vulnerable kids in our society.
3172	Quirk	Bill	23	nQyRqNn-8MI	569	592	But, I mean we have low-income for telephone we have low-income for energy I just can't see why we don't do it for water. I mean we are probably by not doing this, in violation of UN standards much less just the standards we have here as people in California.
3173	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	2UiNZW2oc6A	263	275	Now, victims of sexual harassment in schools, another element of Title IX, and that includes harassment of boys, had no clearly established way to seek any kind of justice or financial settlements.
3174	Leyva	Connie	62	GUxOzh3Wh0Q	1767	1782	So while I completely support alternative energy, I have a question about one of the opponents who said we were subsidizing polluters with this bill. How would you respond to that?
3175	Beall	Jim	92	6rjOa1qOGPA	2389	2413	I tell you what my issue is, is the interregional issue. So that's the issue. So it's gonna go through a process. We deal with relinquishment. It's gonna go to the California Transportation, Caltrans, and the Commission. And when it goes through that process, you wanna work together. Got it? Essentially.
3176	Bonilla	Susan	3	mCVaWE-xXHw	620	640	Mr. Chair and Members, I respectfully present to you today AB 179. It extends the sunset date for the Dental Board of California to January 1, 2020 and the sunset date for the Board of Vocational Nursing and Psychiatric Technicians, BVNPT, from January 1, 2016 to January 1, 2018.
3177	McCarty	Kevin	22	B6r57uGOz9Y	697	706	Are you open to it though, or do you think that you would prefer to focus on what you've already done to date, which is on those augmentations to the existing programs?
3178	Wolk	Lois	94	SvIBnS8_PpY	203	218	Let me talk to you about One E which is a billion-dollar expenditure that you're looking to put out, you must put out quickly, or we lose the money.
3179	De Leon	Kevin	102	G_UP3VHeRGY	542	571	And on top of that if you can go a little into detail in regards to the importation of energy into California and the potential less in state renewable use within the state of California. Because as we know with the EIM the angle objective obviously is to stabilize the market and to lower costs. How do you see this working out through your vision?
3180	Ting	Philip	30	vYqU_TjNJ4I	641	662	Thank you. Anyone else in support? Any opposition? Then I'll bring it back to the committee. Any questions or comments? So I guess my quick question I'm a big believer in incentives, but I also believe in sort of, that we should look for the return that we put out.
3181	Gray	Adam	27	Zr9Ph03Ms5A	786	825	Morning members. I rise today to recognize an outstanding organization from the very heart of my district. I have the privilege of introducing a simple equation under the leadership of their advisor Kelly Turner, joining us here today in Sacramento. They address the needs of girls and women transitioning into society from juvenile justice facilities, enrolled in alternative high schools, or in foster care. They offer personal development mentoring and assist the girls with youth leadership and civic engagement.
3182	Leyva	Connie	62	2w72Z1tf27E	936	984	Lower service standards have also resulted in planned shutdowns of mail sorting centers, including locations in California, potentially affecting some 64,000 postal employees in California and over 20% of whom are US military veterans. At least one of these planned, one of these facilities is planning to shift and distribute, including absentee ballots out of the state. These plans threaten up to 15,000 jobs nationwide. Delayed mail has become rampant since the closing of mail processing facilities, and yet the postal service has decided that they want to close another 82 facilities across the country. Any additional closures will further impede the public's expectation of an affordable and universal United States Postal Service.
3183	Kim	Young	82	bXJhxM-W13s	975	1014	And then they will actually bring them back on and place them in different departments. This is something, I think it goes quite well with what we're discussing. Preparing the next workforce and preparing them for the jobs that are already available, so instead of trying to start from scratch, I think we need to review some of the best practices that're already taking place, and if we can incorporate that into what we're trying to do, I think that would be a win-win for a lot of people. So it's more of a comment and observation that I've had.
3184	Leno	Mark	60	cKW0dtBGGXY	1785	1810	Some consumers would enter the store already informed, I would imagine if this is completely foreign to a consumer, that he or she may not even pay attention to the label, even if their eye catches it, it just doesn't mean anything to them. Another consumer, more curious, might have his or her eye caught, and it says no flame retardants, gosh is that a good or a bad thing.
3185	Pavley	Fran	104	pmiSwefin48	109	121	I know you'll be conscious of putting them in the ground but do you have to craft a partnership or maintenance agreement that the entity who's the recipient of the trees?
3186	Hill	Jerry	66	KoF0I8ZWJLM	390	408	Clarifying amendments on the study language to make these clearer for OEHHA. Clarfying amendments making it clear that maintenance of existing waste tire fields is okay during the two year study period. Three requirements for schools and local governments instead of the moratorium.
3187	Dodd	Bill	71	mgHzB-qdttI	1495	1506	I'm sorry Madam Chair. I, I'd like the other side to talk about the the access to care issue. That's the one thing that I, I still have some reservations on. Please.
3188	Ting	Philip	30	j_YjnTPR-gU	2084	2092	So, again this is not just a concern for only the current CCA's, but really how do we make sure we have a phase in for a CCA start.
3189	Rendon	Anthony	120	843OfhKnV14	1488	1516	So, I wanna thank you for including those particular elements in what is probably gonna be a larger package of PUC reforms that I think we need to work on. So we have a, and with respect to Mr. Hadley's mention of the statutorily mandated hearings. Absolutely right, and I think it's something that the PUC, we need to have more of.
3190	McGuire	Mike	93	zWP9Ch_UvEs	805	817	They share all the benefits of a local community's services, but they often share none of the responsibilities, and as with any growing industry, there needs to be balance.
3191	McGuire	Mike	93	zWP9Ch_UvEs	818	838	This business of home sharing has evolved from its roots of couch surfing to being a multi-billion dollar business, and our bill is simple, all it does is make online vacation rental businesses follow local laws just like the rest of us. No more, no less.
3192	Nielsen	Jim	68	jAn9ObwSR14	351	364	That's what the Committee wants to see happen and we're going to try to set the parameters in our budget decision to ensure that that happens as we proceed.
3193	Cannella	Anthony	61	CKcxsxPbopg	95	113	The competition recognizes outstanding achievements in engineering and land surveying projects completed by California firms. The display highlight some amazing projects up and down the state. Also with me I have several leaders in the industry: Katrina Barrows, the past President of the Professional Engineers in California government.
3194	Nguyen	Janet	65	jWp79DKV-DI	1166	1176	at the end of the day they don't have a place to live and a place to call home. It's a whole different story. Yes, ma'am. And you can rebound and you can go back to where you started.
3195	Mendoza	Tony	52	EhsW00cBA0A	1525	1537	I'm glad that you brought this bill forward, I think it's, having to be part of your district and knowing your district very well, it's, we come across very knowledgable on it.
3196	Hernandez	Roger	37	u8oZZTgP2Tw	271	280	Wonderful. Thank you very much. Anyone else wishing to speak in support the bill? Ok, none. At this time we will call forward the opposition.  Any one in opposition of this bill, please come forward this time. Ok, none. At this time we will call forward the opposition.
3197	Mendoza	Tony	52	E1_HgghcmCU	1018	1039	But you could, I'm thinking about maybe a potential placard. When you guys show up, when I was talking to some of the staffers for Mr. Low yesterday, that when they come up they actually have a placard on their car, pink mustache whatever. Why can't they have a placard issued from DMV saying that this is a commercial vehicle during that time period that they're driving, right?
3198	Roth	Richard	106	ehjG4WNbq0w	688	705	Well, I'm glad you clarified the issue with respect to the applicability of state law and taking in the right to hire your own appraiser and go to court to argue over the valuation of the properties. My understanding that, that process applies, sir?
3199	Mitchell	Holly	64	rD0VjcELenc	579	597	Welcome back to session, colleagues. We'll begin with privileges of the floor. Privileges of the floor. Seeing none, we'll move on to messages from the Governor. They'll be deemed read. Messages from the Assembly, deemed read.
3200	Monning	Bill	25	JK2AAP7nJZs	116	129	Members, I would ask that you plan to be back here at 6:30. 6:30, please, so we can finish our work on the file and get out of here at a reasonable time. Please be prompt.
3201	McCarty	Kevin	22	GE9yKeDoFKQ	1868	1882	Alum Rock, in Santa Clara County and I get streamlining the application process and having people go off the free lunch application process as opposed to doing all the paperwork.
3202	Cooley	Ken	45	cflx69hA7mw	1249	1269	The Friday before that final election I was out at 6:00 a.m., at Loaves and Fishes working as a volunteer, because I personally have felt that working on behalf of homeless is sort of a way to keep me grounded. To keep my feet on the ground in my public aspirations responsibilities.
3203	Anderson	Joel	57	GChQsueBjgw	700	713	I believe that part of the issue is that many of the school board trustees aren't taking their job seriously as they should. And that they're not including how to address these issues with the collective bargaining and the rest.
3204	Rendon	Anthony	120	9Qb9_l0YcHY	1895	1918	I know you're a tough spot. I represent a lot of cities where there are new counsels, new staff. I've said this before, I represent 9 cities of which 5 have former council members in prison. You have these new councils that have inherited exceptionally difficult situations and I know that to a large extent you're in that same boat.
3205	Beall	Jim	92	fMvnlUAhyII	771	783	Sometimes it's things like we found when they rotated judges, the arraignment calendar comes in, the new judge comes in, they start raising the bond levels and things like that.
3206	Levine	Marc	8	RoufXhlsVZI	1181	1193	And to hear that that is likely an understatement of that economic impact is pretty heartening to know how important this industry and this sector really has become for the state of California. So again thank you very much and I look forward to working with all of you long into the future.
3207	Cooper	Jim	21	bn5R6N5l4NI	683	694	But most of these MOUs do withstand the tests of time. I've negotiated MOUs on both sides so. I mean, once in a while but I would say the majority of things are negotiated at the table or the bargaining units, you know, remain in effect.
3208	Nielsen	Jim	68	u0-ac-4sGAg	1534	1549	Mr. Chairman. I have great respect for the author, he's a fair man and a hard working man. I've always seen him looking for the good of the state. I will argue In this particular bill though I think it is problematic, and there is a huge economic impact.
3209	McGuire	Mike	93	GQ9li0L2Ssk	2303	2317	Thank you so much. Good to see you. Anyone else who would like to speak in support of this legislation, please step forward? I would like to be able to see if there are any individuals here that would like to speak in opposition. All right, we're going to close it.
3210	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	4INVuEQu1gA	1736	1752	According to the 2010 census by the United States, we have approximately 6.1 million children under the age of 12, but according to the Department of Social Services, we have the capacity to care for approximately 1 million of those children.
3211	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	1AD-QUnKZQc	1434	1452	Moved? Is there any opposition? That's, thank you very much. There is opposition, I'm so sorry. I didn't see you back there. All right. There is opposition. That's why you're here, its true. All right. Here we go. Opposition. I'm assuming that there's no other support? Witnesses in support? All right. Opposition, Mr. Belote.
3212	Alejo	Luis	9	fNO-vhR1Uas	1788	1805	When it's this type of a unique and dire situation for these types of communities and these types of economically disadvantage senses areas, where we perhaps should we do something a little bit differently than we do and other types of situations. So, we have some questions from other colleagues here.
3213	Leno	Mark	60	E7fL6Rs-58o	712	735	Without it of course they are seven times greater likelihood of finding his or her way into our criminal justice system. This bill entitled the Preschool for All Act, will assist all low-income children who do not have access to transitional kindergarten to have access to state preschool programs.
3214	Stone	Jeff	26	7VfcnWx6nzU	925	937	And then two, you mentioned the flight of people that are arrested that post bail and take off and you never see them again. We're still in possession of their $100,000.
3215	Hernandez	Roger	37	eYvHQ6iO6CE	1692	1704	This bill also requires that MSA's develop a statewide trauma plan to address all aspects of trauma care system and report to the legislator the status of the development or implementation of the statewide trauma plan.
3216	Nguyen	Janet	65	qBs9W23Am_w	376	388	It is only right to give aid and protection to allies that fought alongside the United States Armed Forces. In closing, I respectfully ask for your aye vote. Thank you, and I can answer any questions.
3217	Leno	Mark	60	h8juzK-Kjc4	253	281	We've seen our poverty rates increase as the top 1 % has garnered 95% of all the economic benefits since the recovery started in 2009. And this of course is bad for consumer spending and our economy suffers employers actually don't hire, and potentially fire.
3218	Dababneh	Matthew	50	tC7sJemEjBU	807	827	For institutions that already have a program in place that will be, obviously, the first option. For those institutions that don't have a program in place to adopt these animals, we're simply asking them to allow a 501 c non-profit animal welfare organization to step in, have an opportunity to adopt these animals out, and prevent them from being euthanized unnecessarily.
3219	Moorlach	John	4657	wxAms1gWFJA	757	784	I think this year I just found out we've got 2.3 billion. Next year we've got another sizable amount of funds that could pay for these bonds. So I'm wondering do I request legislative council to review Prop 98 to see if that's were the payment source can come from. That's sort of the direction.
3220	Hill	Jerry	66	YdjLhzjfzcg	327	346	Yeah, I can see coming without the appropriate, and I noticed in some of the reading that you have to have the particular tools that are necessary for the trade, and that sometimes they may not bring the correct tools and that can be a problem, so I appreciate that very much. Thank you for that, and for the comments.
3221	Cooper	Jim	21	iF8zLPAheNg	1521	1533	our kids. Obviously in some of the other states they have had major problems with children. Just think about it the little detergent pods that small kids eat now. they are gonna have marijuana gum. It mentions in it, in the bill.
3222	Cannella	Anthony	61	TKhvu3W6NHQ	158	186	So as we talked about yesterday in the environmental work that was done for this, it talks about impacts of groundwater and says they're significant but unavoidable. And that was disheartening for me, because look if you take surface flows away from farmers, they're going to pump more and we've got a real crisis with groundwater pumping.
3223	Nielsen	Jim	68	y2dm_Q__xog	710	740	In addition, I'd like to discuss with you, in the future we not exempt agencies of government as was done last year to the Water Resources Control Board, exempting them from OAL review. I was around the creation of the office of administrative law, working with speaker Liam Mccarthy. And our point was that we've got to make sure a regulation has a statutory basis. It is not an underground regulation.
3224	Hill	Jerry	66	U-gbn_qz8sg	1559	1573	Or would the supply adjust and then we'd have a reduced supply at the end of the day because of that and would it actually increase in the end of the--?
3225	Glazer	Steve	10481	OaKXojP7k_0	1320	1330	2019. That would allow us to again reevaluate this and ensure it's done in the best interests of the state and the tax payers, and with that I ask for an aye vote.
3226	McGuire	Mike	93	zieucXg-cLU	904	912	No. Thank you. We're really happy that you came today and want to keep in touch so please don't leave without us getting your information and we'll let you know when the next hearing is as well.
3227	Nielsen	Jim	68	_ES7C4KFvkc	432	443	One good point that is made about the Career Tech Ed is that Career Tech Ed has embraced excellence in education and standards and those are important and should be built-in to this.
3228	Hadley	David	40	Jfvd2Tinaec	908	931	And we can only use half of this rainy day fund in any particular year, and of that half, we can only use about half of that for education.So we're talking about approximately $600 million. Could be drawn from the rainy day fund in a single year to meet educational funding downturns when we see the need to draw on this rainy day fund.
3229	Baker	Catharine	74	kQ8roglP29M	987	999	And yet, it won't receive any of the benefits, I think, that you're focusing on when it should because there will be an air quality issue there. And so that's my greatest concern with the bill. I don't know if you can address that.
3230	Holden	Chris	78	2I6PZI7YgJ8	1148	1181	Three, accelerate learning for students by creating a framework that allows students who demonstrate competency, to up to fifteen units of community college course work, instead of eleven units. According to James Irvine Foundation study; concurrent enrollment can help low-achieving students integrate into a college environment, increase the likelihood a degree program will be completed, decrease the length of time to complete a degree program, and stimulate interest in higher education among high school students.
3231	Wilk	Scott	19	h-QyikgWJeU	400	448	However Reagan stood strong on those founding principles and gave voice to those I believe that America was a shining light on the hill. Now as a nation we have not achieved all those ideals. We in this house work every day to make those things come to reality, but it's about the journey getting there and working together. We will get there, so I hope you'll join me in honoring the only person to ever serve as Governor of California and President of the United States of America, Ronald Reagan. I asked the first roll be open to co-authors.
3232	Beall	Jim	92	GcYm7_0fTAo	168	194	We need to take some strong action on this. More than we've done in the typical health programs. And I'd like to work with any Senators who'd like to help me and assembly members to raise the level of prevention awareness for this particular public health problem. I think we have to do something and I support you for your efforts. Thank you very much.
3233	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	47vy5JeX0sg	798	816	Are there any other privileges of the floor. Seeing none. Messages from the Governor will be deemed read, messages from the Assembly will be deemed read, reports of Committee will be deemed read and amendments adopted. Under motions and resolutions and notices.
3234	Cooley	Ken	45	UvJ80C9MwvM	1753	1777	Let me just ask here, Vanessa, just since I've got you here, hearing that comment from the Department of Education. Do you have any comments or observations or thing you would put a spotlight on this transitional to local control funding formula? And providing supportive services, just is there anything that hearing that testimony sort of fires off for you as someone whose looked at these issues?
3235	Mullin	Kevin	31	X5ZwfIJ2xIA	689	705	Members if we can have your attention we will be moving to business on the daily file. Business on the daily file, item number one a ACR5 by Assembly Member Jones Sawyer. The clerk will read.
3236	Hertzberg	Robert	99	yhx1NvxzAgA	1234	1247	And then it also extends the time if it's a minor, rather than under the law, it changes it differently. And then in addition as a bolt on, we're gonna give you a one time window. To litigate these issues.
3237	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	519YUTER2IM	1826	1843	The 2015 standard car isn't going to have to meet the 2020 standard. It's not going to be retrofitted, there's no requirement of retrofitting here. This is as we create new plants, they're going to have to abide by the latest new technologies under the formula that we've just discussed.
3238	Berryhill	Tom	54	Uhijp_1CdK4	1067	1079	Having said that, my farming community is very concerned that there needs to be a few amendments taken. I like what I'm hearing, that there's a commitment to work and getting through all this stuff.
3239	Stone	Jeff	26	34DjaBqbEpQ	842	861	And in Riverside County we certainly had had a number of emergency where we've had to mobilize, fires, and of course earthquakes are always a concern. Can you briefly tell me the relationship between OEMS and FEMA, and local EMS programs and all the 58 counties in the state?
3240	Stone	Jeff	26	HgBIr1hupMw	2245	2259	But I still think we need to be transparent and really understand what the real costs are to know what the challenges are in the state so that as we improve better financially which we hope that the state does that we can ensure that our providers are paid appropriately. And we get our kids taken care of.
3241	Mendoza	Tony	52	HutoDdelxCc	966	990	I appreciate that answer. I wasn't born in any military base or anything like that myself. I was born and raised in south-central LA so I know the schools are in despair and there's a lot of need there as well. But I do see the value of you know, not leaving $240 million on the table. I wish we had that opportunity for all the other schools, but you know, I see the need.
3242	Bloom	Richard	2	C5FKcnZ9gio	953	973	This is a very Democratic measure. This allows Democratically elected local government officials to choose by their vote to ask the voters by a two thirds majority to enact an increase in tax.
3243	Nguyen	Janet	65	vHDzhT6IdSE	26	40	Good afternoon. Thank you Madam Chair and committee members for giving me the opportunity to present this before you. SJR5 urges the United State Government to reauthorize the Humanitarian Resettlement Program to include disabled veterans of the South Vietnamese Army.
3244	Cooper	Jim	21	WE6m9wVcbNQ	1618	1628	So I really don't know what the big deal is. We're trying to protect our kids, it's the bottom line. So, I respectfully ask for your support for this bill, thank you. Thank you Mr. Cooper.
3245	Thurmond	Tony	4	gf6xiaI75uY	1505	1528	Thank you. Quick question Mr. Rand, thank you for your testimony and, yeah, I'm glad that you clarified about the question of audits because I've visited many charter schools and many of them are nonprofits and I know that they're required to do an audit so. And that made complete sense and I, you know, I'll support this bill because
3246	De Leon	Kevin	102	YGvsvPIzjxQ	1172	1179	I think that'd be our close. So with that, I thank you very much for your indulgence to our wonderful colleagues of the Assembly. And we respectively ask for an aye vote.
3247	Thurmond	Tony	4	eLkMhyjfqgI	1762	1791	Joseph Berry, representing Disability Organizing Group for Initiating Total equality. I just want to echo what Mister Thurmond said, and that is that, unfortunately whether's a cut with our I-H-S-S hours or cut with our Social Security money.
3248	Baker	Catharine	74	9fvwP7KwrvY	1540	1557	But I'm not seeing how this actually, given that the document between the doctor and the NP governs what protocols can happen, that this is going to really expand care, which would be the goal I would think. I suppose that's a comment.
3249	Hueso	Ben	48	CVYbaFO-ROE	1106	1123	But also to provide services evenly throughout the region so that people that are in low service areas can also have access to that transportation. And that often has created conflicts. The state has decided to enter that debate and disrupt all the work that's been on the local level.
3250	Gatto	Mike	46	dSqmLCv394A	106	122	Similarly, if you are a lifetime Kaiser Permanente patient, and you have been with them for fifty, sixty years and all of your health records are breached, it's not like there's a, you know, a fungible market there either, where you can say well I'm just, I'm sick of them, I'm going to go to whoever.
3251	Cannella	Anthony	61	ocHLYdjgc30	461	473	And that can only be sustained if we have a transportation system that works, because a lot of the goods that we create in California that helps that never be so high, a lot of them are in the central valley with agriculture.
3252	Kim	Young	82	-Bv1QTsnUc8	700	720	And so one of the witnesses who was speaking in opposition to this bill talked about whether or not this model is working. And I think our witnesses who spoke in support of that have clearly stated that it is working and API scores are increasing.
3253	Lara	Ricardo	107	ptq5V1Fu0ok	1124	1143	Six to one that item is out. Moving on to AB 177 Professions and Vocations Sunset Extensions. Do pass as amended per author to allow application for licensure before obtaining a degree and make technical corrections. We will substitute the roll from AB 361 that bill is approved by unanimous vote of 7 to 0.
3254	Bloom	Richard	2	ITEaoTWbk6c	836	855	This is a water crisis and we are called upon to act. The severity of what lies ahead is anyone's guess. However we cannot dispute that our water supplies are diminishing due to climate change while at the same time, demand for water increases due to natural population growth
3255	Nielsen	Jim	68	D32BRjJtFrw	881	911	Variously, these programs have been affected to various stages. Do we have a good ability to track and monitor whether or not they're really achieving any purpose in saving the emissions? There's a lot of money being spent on different things, and are we tracking in any way some of these things to determine if they really are meeting the tests? Do we have any studies? How are we following up?
3256	Eggman	Susan Talamantes	73	-bJq_JGSuxY	976	994	I'll just say thank you very much. We're very excited. We've been working on this for quite a while now, bringing together the solar industry, the community, environmental justice agencies, apartment owners and saying how do we actually crack this divide. I'll say that the funding we're talking about currently is already set aside.
3257	Low	Evan	11	JQ5xKCGxzzk	1375	1387	Sure, yeah, there's a number of questions, including "have you traveled to a number of different countries?", including, "have you engaged in activity with a person of the same sex?".
3258	Pan	Richard	96	Zk_K_zhn8-Q	1656	1684	And that's, and at least initially last year we were told, well there's some flexibility in the ability of the Department when they identified these pockets of truly absent access, that they would have some flexibility to have monies to negotiate. Just find somebody I don't want the state pay any more then it has to for these services, alright.  But if no one's willing to take what's being offered then you have to negotiate with somebody and find somebody who's willing to do it and that there would be some flexibility.
3259	McGuire	Mike	93	oFD3dFY_sMo	590	610	Thank you very much, 4-0-1. As Miss Lou will be here in just a bit. Do appreciate that. Is there a motion to be able to pass SP199 as amended to appropriations committee? We have a motion by the Vice Chair. Roll call vote please.
3260	Hernandez	Ed	103	JtKXoGz7JFs	194	204	This is not new to you. It's come before your hearing before. It's new obviously to some of the new members. But very briefly, let me talk about how I came about this body of work.
3261	Cooley	Ken	45	1NZUtvyVKUY	1199	1213	A robust enforcement and regulatory scheme is essential for California to bring the medical marijuana indust, industry out from the underground economy, and to ensure that patients can receive this medicinal product in a safe and legal way, as intended by Prop 215.
3262	Beall	Jim	92	4mB1nCFXohc	109	157	And it is what we do to get people that are trying to find a way to get to their jobs without going through congestion. And I believe this is the intent of the Cap-and-Trade Program relative to transportation. It's to get people out of their cars, into transit and active transportation. And the other kinds of transportation that we have, and there's such a great need in our state for that. So I just want to express my concern about that, we're gonna have an ongoing continued discussions about that, but I'm just gonna say I want to pass this out of the committee so we can get moving on it.
3263	Cooley	Ken	45	1NZUtvyVKUY	1215	1234	In a moment, I'm gonna turn it to Tim Cromartie from the League of Cities. But I do want to speak just briefly on the principal difference that I think we as members will grapple with as, as hopefully, my bill moves forward, as, as Mr. Bonta and Mr. Jones-Sawyer bill moves forward, is this question of oversight.
3264	Block	Marty	59	HgBIr1hupMw	56	72	We are going slightly out of order today. We have a time certain for Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson from District 19 who will be presenting a proposal at the beginning of our meeting, if there's no objection.
3265	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	8AAoooSnIWE	1384	1399	Which means he's worth hundreds of millions of dollars to the general fund, hundreds of million of dollars that can go back to programming for other people who want to get out, but most important that probably will exceed what we need, and we can also use that for schools, for roads, and other things,
3266	Weber	Shirley	44	7i9bh_kaYv0	647	659	And it's interesting in terms our evolution as a state, last year we had two bills, my colleague assembly member Buchanan and I co-authored two bills together concerning Kindergarten.
3267	Levine	Marc	8	fnhJHfsu-gk	52	63	Where would you anticipate those cuts to come from? I know you're not the administration, but where would your fears be as to where would they go? How would that effect those lives?
3268	Levine	Marc	8	fnhJHfsu-gk	38	52	Which we will have to do if we don't resolve this now. When you're thinking about what those cuts look like, what are you seeing? What would that mean in reduced services?
3269	Holden	Chris	78	PeQL6v-QN50	320	338	Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I request unanimous consent to suspend Assembly Rule 118 and allow Speaker Atkins, Assemblymembers Allen, Christina Garcia, Mr. Nazarian, Quirk, Santiago, Thurmond and Wilk to have guests and photographers on the floor today.
3270	Holden	Chris	78	PeQL6v-QN50	343	358	Mr. Wilk's guest will be at his desk. Mr. Speaker, I request unanimous consent to suspend Assembly Rule 45.5 and allow Assemblymembers Brough, Jones, Quirk, Thurmond and Wagner to speak on adjourn in memory today.
3271	Wood	Jim	72	TYBUIhFGo6I	920	934	So, I'm gonna see if Mr. Chau has any questions of this group. I have, well, first of all, I wanna thank this particular panel. I don't have any specific questions. I appreciate where you're coming from.
3272	Block	Marty	59	OOj1xAhpXgw	326	356	SB 15 will cure these ills. It will help with access for students, it will help with affordability for students, it will make California's great system of higher education even greater, and it's all based on one grand concept that will benefit our entire state, it's not a controversial concept, it's that students should finish a four-year degree in four years. With that I urge your aye vote.
3273	McCarty	Kevin	22	JG7mRMz5Gp8	754	770	But superintendents by large, they're, I'm not an educator but I would think they were prior teachers, then they became school principals, then they become superintendents, so they're later up in their years. They've accumulated a lot of years probably in the CalSTRS System, so many times,
3274	Wieckowski	Bob	55	Ol0PhdDSV8c	1751	1766	and that will raise emissions over time. can you talk about how the agencies are working to how are these effects being considered and, how can we sort of sort through those issues?
3275	Stone	Jeff	26	0MzTgkt-Llc	758	771	So the appropriate route to protect the species is to make a request of the federal government to put it on an endangered species list. So everybody's playing by the same rules. So for those reasons, I oppose AB 559.
3276	Huff	Bob	105	iJc5cTYtc4Q	343	355	And some of that debt is rolling off. But I believe this money is already supposed to be earmarked for fixing things, and as we're looking for revenue to fix things I'm just saying, this should be low hanging fruit.
3277	Wolk	Lois	94	aKK8kwy-F68	394	411	The law would give California adult residents who are in the end stages of terminal illness and who are mentally competent the option to get a prescription from their physician which will allow them to end their lives painlessly.
3278	Quirk	Bill	23	zsDLiRLL6-I	799	825	If you don't allow fishing expeditions, which I would agree it is at least expensive and perhaps not appropriate, how then can you release video? And, what would constitute a fishing expedition rather than simple release to the public? It's just not at all clear to me.
3279	Block	Marty	59	qfFmDsO0ZjY	68	85	Okay, again this panel is limited to twenty five minutes, you have five people, that comes out to about five minutes each based on my math. So, self-regulating we will begin at the top the list with Mr. Covert.
3280	Hernandez	Ed	103	rLEgt6RVkfo	1129	1155	The reason why I am supporting this is because of the sunset to kind of figure out and see how we can control the cost to the consumer. But there's something I think we need to really have a discussion. There's an underlying problem and it still deals with overall controlling cost of the health care system and that's the increasing cost of prescription medications. At the end of the day, so what's gonna happen?
3281	Obernolte	Jay	86	GSFM9WIHPWo	1592	1606	And I would really like to see your department finish that process and implement the reforms that are recommended by the auditor before we vote on a budget augmentation. That's a very difficult the decision for me.
3282	Melendez	Melissa	41	Qd8yv7EufE4	1269	1290	Okay, thank you, that does answer my questions. I would like that information. I am going to stay off the bill for today because I do need to dig a little deeper into my district about how they feel about this. And you are well aware of the negative impact that you're having on the dating lives of these teenagers, right? I just, okay, just making sure, and I thank you for that. But, I'm going to stay off the bill today.
3283	Hernandez	Ed	103	BsDlxjqmuUc	827	835	We reduce the amount of time from 48 to 24 hours for a response, and the reason why is because of the importance of the types of medications that are there.
3284	Bloom	Richard	2	24W2oeMkjbI	1368	1387	And from, of course, members of the bar and member of our communities. I'm not convinced that this is or this isn't going to make it easier for the court facilities to take these funds and apply them to different purposes.
3285	McGuire	Mike	93	i3P-QI4InjM	1551	1576	I think everyone wants great coverage, and there are challenges to be able to locate them in some areas without opposition. So I hear that and what I appreciate is hearing that there needs to be some very specific language of public noticing and respecting those local jurisdictions in their current administrative guidelines that they have in place.
3286	Block	Marty	59	75GgF4MuVHk	281	299	With me here to testify in support and answer any questions are Dr. Jennifer Bahr, a Naturopathic Doctor, Dr. Marcus Miller, a Medical Doctor and Naturopathic Doctor, a Professor at the National College of Natural Medicine and Pharmacology. And Rebecca Mitchell, Executive Officer of the California Naturopathic Medicine Committee.
3287	Chavez	Rocky	83	bfEm2Iz1r44	579	600	When you actually look at it and look at the LAO's recommendation how we ran a state agency, I can tell you. If you have a state agency program going on, often it becomes not what is that program doing? It's just that Mr. Smith's been here for 15 years and he's gonna retire in 5, so we can't kill that program till he retires.
3288	Rodriguez	Freddie	69	j_cwUXYUJzk	241	260	Wireless carriers can now generally provide latitude and longitude information for cellphone calls, but are limited in more specific location data that can be provided to 911. When you call 911 from a wireless cellphone, the signal first goes to a cell tower, which may not be the closest tower to you.
3289	Mitchell	Holly	64	ofo4g2uUHBA	506	519	As a recipient, whether I lived on the west side or the south side or the east side, I know my child to get access to the services that every other mother's child could as well.
3290	Roth	Richard	106	SCWpb6PxRGE	233	256	We are not excusing or accepting any business that does not have exterior parking that fully complies with the ADA standards and the California building code. It is simply freshening the paint on paint that may be faded. It is simply posting the correct sign where the signage requirements may have changed one year or two years before.
3291	Mullin	Kevin	31	4tou47dRNaA	162	175	Thank you Mr. Gomez see no discussion or debate on the item clerk will open the roll. All members vote who desire to vote, all members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. The clerk will close the roll tally the vote.
3292	Cooper	Jim	21	gmSplS1IxCE	1071	1082	And it's amazing having worked a lot of concerts and venues over the years, 10 years ago, you rarely smelled marijuana, any concert venue or sports venue when you work now and cars are leaving, all you smell is marijuana.
3293	Stone	Jeff	26	npLG8Ena6eQ	976	1011	And, who's going to have that liability? Shouldn't there be a provision in this law that ensures the safe return of the aid in dying drug back to the pharmacy for destruction if it is not consume in a finite period of time. On page eight, line 32 the bill states that the person seeking to take a lethal cocktail did not arise from coercion or undue influence by another person.
3294	Block	Marty	59	6Q6Wi0P8Q78	0	25	Okay, thank you, if there are no further questions or comments on, on item number four, we'll have much more discussion on this after the revise, and in the interim we'll discuss these a, as you wish. Now we're gonna move to issue number five, capital quality, Capital Outlay Proposals. And for item five, Mr. Troy and Miss Heinman remain, but Koreen Hansen will be joining us from the Department of Finance.
3295	Cooper	Jim	21	gmSplS1IxCE	1062	1071	And, I'm a former DRE, drug recognition expert, if you're  under the influence, you're gonna exhibit certain signs and symptoms. That's how we make those arrests all the time for individuals like that.
3296	Mendoza	Tony	52	E1_HgghcmCU	2320	2334	Mr. Chair, can we wait another week so we could kinda through your office work this out this as far as study bills that we get more? There will be a vote only next week just like a vote only.
3297	McCarty	Kevin	22	7bdBeI04iMY	1165	1178	brought about more transparency in public trust I think this approach is the same thing I can still bring a needed approach to the to the issue in California I think this is a smart measure thank you.
3298	De Leon	Kevin	102	SxRX-lKXiDU	263	286	As a local area district, your main focus obviously is on stationary pollution sources. CARB is on mobile sources. And mobile sources are the majority of the big emitters of both carbon and other criteria pollutants, contaminants into our air. What's your relationship like with your local air district and CARB?
3299	Bonta	Rob	85	GYqLytCM9KA	1670	1698	Thank you Mr. Speaker and members. I'm proud to rise in support of AB 1366 as a principle co-author. AB 1366 will help increase enrollment and graduation rates for California's undocumented population, especially API's and Latinos. The nine dream resource centers currently serving California have proven successful. AB 1366 will expand the number of centers to new areas of the state where they are critically needed I urge an aye vote.
3300	Alejo	Luis	9	Ln1AhL9Lp3Y	1218	1234	But beyond that, the Youth Department of Education Office of Civil Rights also has pointed that it creates a hostile learning environment for Native American children as well. So it's repeated, reputable organizations and federal agencies that have pointed out the damage this causes.
3301	Bonilla	Susan	3	yLYXPq0fwvY	221	239	So that was the intention of this safe harbor was to do our work as policy makers and force a meaningful and workable solution. I like to call it, instead of just granting amnesty, we wanted a pathway for doing business in California. And we need time to create that pathway.
3302	Wieckowski	Bob	55	hOXjsAX0HBg	32	54	We will then convene the legislative hearing and start with a special order of business. Today, in that special order, we got to hear about SB 654 by Senator De Leon who-- and SB 673 by Senator Lara, both making a statutory reforms of DTSCs permitting process. Then we'll here 29--
3303	Lara	Ricardo	107	_fRo9qb8Uik	1588	1605	Because it looks like they are getting the short end of the stick, again, in comparison to the UC. You know, I've always been a critic to this committee of two. At least there should have been a committee of four, including our CSU, and our community colleges, if we really want to talk about higher education in the state.
3304	Grove	Shannon	77	uSmu0VlTZFk	172	184	Due to the suspicious details surrounding his death, the Orange County Coroner's still investigating the cause of that death, and the cause of that death, I was hoping would be available by the time this hearing took place, but it is not.
3305	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	ZmQN_cLb26Y	1588	1604	Six one that bill is out. Thank you. The next item is file item four by assemblywoman Cristina Garcia, AB 365. The vote count is six to zero, please call the absent members.
3306	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	U78_h0h7YJE	1176	1193	What kind of types of buildings could we have as far as failures and collapses that could become more than the what is it $40 billion or whatever happened in Northridge. We could be looking at what $100, $200 billion with another type of building that could be going down.
3307	Pavley	Fran	104	RM5OAEIHO1U	938	956	You've already expended some money out the door, correct? And so now we're, I'm thinking about the LAO's recommendation on how that money has already been spent, and what was its intended purpose and did we accomplish that result.
3308	Roth	Richard	106	IUqqKj1b5UE	311	335	So, what happens to that situation where we're waiting for a bed to open up in a facility that equipped to treat the patient. So, the patient is held in the acute care facility, perhaps not in the emergency room because perhaps there's no room, but not necessarily as an inpatient if if that can possibly happen. So how does this bill impact that situation is my question?
3309	Hernandez	Roger	37	mRtWZWKaAFE	505	536	Okay, and then just the, the last question here. And let me see let's see who should answer this one here. Are these passengers that are providing the real-time background on the sobriety of their passenger? Are they trained experts on on, on sobriety? Are, are they administering breathalyzer examinations? Are they doing this stuff for the passenger, the drivers?
3310	Cooley	Ken	45	gXZO0cZqlQg	1027	1045	I put this bill in part because in 1982, when I was young in my career in this building, I worked on AB 1733 which established a child abuse and neglect funding for the first time in California. That stream of revenue has been very important to the evolution and
3311	Thurmond	Tony	4	eYTxGLtgMco	2027	2050	Thank you. Ms. Steer, my final comment is just this. Again, I appreciate the author's intent. You know, as I said, my thoughts are really shaped by my experience. Being in an environment that had a very rigid cap in having to see us forego a lot of important operational spending needs.
3312	Grove	Shannon	77	J10r6qWX-gc	1809	1819	And so if they choose not to access welfare and to work hard and, you know, on the job that they have, they have a waiting list. That's correct. Yes. That's correct.
3313	Cannella	Anthony	61	8L1SsBHKNBQ	723	737	We had a discussion yesterday and I very much enjoyed it. You guys are, obviously qualified professionally for this commission. But, I want to talk a little bit about the SRA.
3314	Mitchell	Holly	64	1Cg0mtHELcY	1148	1167	Again, we appreciate you coming, giving of your time, and sharing your perspective. It's important to me, as a policy-maker, to hear varied experiences to help inform my decision as one vote in my house. So, I appreciate it on behalf of my colleagues as well. We'll see you at the next Sub 3 hearing.
3315	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	B4ydjBRtO3M	778	794	And then my third question, you need to verify whether or not these stories, or at least give me the straight poop of what really happened. And then the third thing is, Connie talked about funding, Connie Rice, getting it off the ground, ensuring that the officers are there for five years, so that there's some continuity.
3316	Cooper	Jim	21	dfinQbvsuZo	554	566	Thank you Mr. Speaker and members. AB 1018 requires the Department of Health Care Services and the California Department of Education, to convene a joint task force on the topic of middle health services for children.
3317	Moorlach	John	4657	5xYY96cBqDg	456	474	Senator Bonta, have you reviewed the financial statements of this agency? Of San Andrew Hospital? Of just this Eden. I mean, it's healthcare district. Which one is it? Yep. ... Your healthcare district? Yeah, have you reviewed the balance sheet or the coffer?
3318	Pan	Richard	96	vjd6Y9hnzuc	730	745	In terms of not only the state, but also localities also suffered, made cuts to public health infrastructure during the recession. And you've listed the litany of infectious disease threats that we're facing right now.
3319	De Leon	Kevin	102	8UaA3ArF3qo	164	191	So, we have an appointment before us which is under secretary of healthcare services, department of correction, and that is Diana Toche. Diana Toche, im reading it phonetically right there. So ok, Diana Toche. Welcome, if there is anyone you'd like to introduce, family members, friends, loved ones, please do so and we'd like a brief statement.
3320	Williams	Das	12	JT1Tm7zEIWc	1504	1542	Nothing in this section shall be construed to alter any existing statutory or common law as to attorney's fees. And what I can commit to is at very least this with, again, the intention of not tipping the balance. I am, again, not an attorney, not even a recovering attorney. So this is one of the cases where you have to kind of rely off of the expertise of some of the attorneys around you.
3321	Roth	Richard	106	osLFdvvw3yM	203	220	Consistent with our concern that we keep some control over things here and have some reporting requirement so that we can keep track of projects to make sure, not that yours would, but to make sure that things don't get out of hand before we wake up over here and start asking questions.
3322	Gordon	Richard	117	9MQl_MfHN90	970	990	As the bill will be amended pursue it to the committees analysis, AB 287 would largely track a pending federal bill that will require vehicles to be repaired or the recall prompting defect litigated prior to even renting the vehicle. The federal bill is supported by the big rental car companies and numerous consumer groups, including some that are currently opposing this bill.
3323	Nazarian	Adrin	36	tZPhmJE-0lQ	960	988	In continuing with some of the Sub 4 and overall Budget Committee initiatives, I wanted to have the Board of Equalization come up right now. We've heard about this item throughout the year, and so at this point, would like to continue the dialogue That's issue number six, Board of Equalization, cigarette tax and licensing program. Morning.
3324	Mitchell	Holly	64	0wls8HR1alY	1344	1355	Because they're concerned with this. They said, "oh we've aged out", and so I'm looking around at them like "aged out? What age group are you talking about?" \n"18 to 24." \nI said, "trust me right you have not aged out."
3325	De Leon	Kevin	102	sO-5THRTetI	709	737	With the Local Control Accountability plan, the LCAP. What type of metrics do you both recommend to ensure that the infusion of dollars, which to legislative body here, we're in support of, and voted on, in agreement with the Governor, to look for a paradigm shift with regards to student outcomes, in particular low income students.
3326	Campos	Nora	76	XBK8TgfRp6Y	824	845	And how do we address that, so that we can start changing from what I'm hearing from you, changing the culture so that there is no retaliation against the employee who decides that? And gives them and empowers them to be able to go through the mainstream,
3327	Chavez	Rocky	83	UFmCagPc99I	389	401	So that we can, on a very consistent approach over time, you know, treat those that need the drug the most first. But, eventually, you know, treat as many folks as can be treated with the funds available.
3328	Bonta	Rob	85	fnUfudXhqYg	182	204	The difficulty is that we're putting these facilities together under the adjusted rate model, which doesn't support this cost structure. It doesn't just fail with regards to the cost structure, it also fails to provide the same services that a six bed facility would, because of the way in which the formulas and calculations have been made under title 17.
3329	Salas	Rudy	34	qX9LkjyICPY	888	902	A lot of talk lately about online this game, that game, but I was reading something that the state of Illinois has, like an online way to purchase tickets for the lottery.
3330	Beall	Jim	92	yp3pHtPtFfM	2067	2085	So that people don't end up in the emergency room nine or ten times a year. It includes the fire department, the police department, all these agencies that end up having to respond an emergency. We used to call them frequent flyers.
3331	Stone	Mark	20	pgW_T12xdBU	1062	1071	And Mr. Chair I have just one more question.  I think I've got the answer this, but I want to make sure it's on-the-record. Is there anything in this bill that would make IHSS workers considered state employees?
3332	Stone	Mark	20	Iv2-QZj_dZk	1293	1307	And yet, due to confusion or lack of information on the defendant's side, they may not know that. So trying to increase the amount of information that happens when an ADA suit is filed is the goal here.
3333	Chavez	Rocky	83	B6r57uGOz9Y	54	74	No, not 10 years, seven years, whatever you have. Because I think that's the sort of information that people like me sitting in this seat could actually use. So, when you are talking about you want to defend your program and everybody's looking at outcomes, that would be really good.
3334	Roth	Richard	106	osLFdvvw3yM	1645	1668	So, what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna hold this open, and I'd ask for you all to get with budget staff and provide whatever documentation they need with respect to one the condition of the fund, the obligations of the fund of the impact of projected repayments beginning in 2017 on the fund.
3335	Ting	Philip	30	6rjOa1qOGPA	632	645	At this point, there are only three bridges that actually charge pedestrians to walk across the bridge, and they're all border crossing bridges, so they're bridges that either are contiguous to Canada or to Mexico. And because of that border crossing, they actually charge a fee.
3336	De Leon	Kevin	102	SU8_KAMcIaE	52	74	Dr. Capitman, you are a member of the  San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District Board, which we do have a member who geographically resides in your area, as well is geographically apportions, is the actual state senator who represents that specific area.
3337	Leno	Mark	60	ELlYlrBZUfQ	344	365	Right. So, it's more complicated than that and I know we have a lot of costs that the receiver has put on us with regard to healthcare that are unavoidable, but as we move forward I would just like to point out again a savings of $10 million from the Department that has grown by a billion dollars over the past couple of years, is very attractive.
3338	Wieckowski	Bob	55	hOXjsAX0HBg	596	619	And I know your predecessor ask for temps so we gave temps. But I don't know if you can get to if you can get to that that is that, on these complex permanent applications and review and now we want to catch up. Is that the right rule of the legislature, giving you temporary help when you're at 25% of what you should be or what you had been doing before? And I'm concern about that.
3339	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	qjDm_sZ-lfo	567	591	I'm more than happy to go back and look at where that is now obviously, when we introduced the bill, it had yet to be enforced. Our main concern is this. And I'll continue to work on AILA on some of the other things, but our main concern is this. Expanded DACA and DAPA may never exist. And, it was the same concern we had about immigration reform.
3340	Campos	Nora	76	1KjWKKHWibE	1053	1078	to make sure that they didn't have to come to a council meeting and have a public hearing on every piece of equipment that would come into the city. So they will have an assessment of what the list will look like. The community will have the opportunity to give input on it, and then they will not have to go before the governing body every time.
3341	Levine	Marc	8	xdWYyoTV6kU	729	746	In 1953, he graduated from veterinary school at UC Davis. Following graduation he was drafted in the Army Veterinary Corp. Later, he established a veterinary practice in Katady. Bill was known as a soft-spoken, but tenacious man. He was well liked by all including his political challengers.
3342	Pan	Richard	96	8_WRsqziEsc	1008	1028	her to see DentiCal patients as charity for free, than to actually enroll in the Denti-Cal program. Which obviously, if we have children having to, if that's the level of access that they have to hope that someone will see them free. So perhaps can someone comment? Is that just simply one story or is that something that's going across the dental world?
3343	Thurmond	Tony	4	58ODc-fO4Eo	348	367	Accept it because as my colleague have said, this is historic and ground breaking that California would be considering for the first time any ITC and would have one. And as my colleagues have said, we live in a state that has such wealth but such poverty and such disparity, and so the impact of this is just significant.
3344	Weber	Shirley	44	9oY9RNUdfPk	568	586	And that's a major step for us to look at everything we do here, so I really want to thank our Chairman. He's a strong advocate coming out of the Bay Area in terms of social service agencies and work. And those of you here who have been warriors in the battlefield for a long time. But it's good to know that as I said, the cavalry is coming.
3345	Weber	Shirley	44	9oY9RNUdfPk	551	568	because we have the hype of opportunities, the jobs, the resources and support. That really puts them in deeper poverty by working. We want to change that dynamic, and that's gonna be very important. So, we're looking at a number of things to live up to that philosophy, that no one who works full time should basically live in poverty.
3346	Levine	Marc	8	mYMmmzreoTQ	593	603	Good afternoon. Thank you all for being here. I'm Assemblymember Marc Levine. I represent the 10th Assembly District, Marin and Southern Sonoma County, and in the Committee on Aging and Long-Term Care.
3347	Berryhill	Tom	54	tae4cv2hHsk	134	146	So for me I think we should keep this as simple as possible. I think this makes it more complicated than it has to be. So I won't be supporting this bill today but wish the best of luck on it.
3348	Pavley	Fran	104	GeGPm9PK4o0	244	268	First of all, let me thank the California Council on Science and Technology for their excellent job. The especially reader friendly, legislative friendly synopsis that you have in your binder sort of captures their recommendations and concerns. And I also want to thank for the ongoing involvement of the Department of Conservation and State Water Boards.
3349	Wood	Jim	72	llrxaJMn6L0	656	667	And while I completely agree with that, I guess I'm also concerned about the unintended consequences. And so I would, you know, look forward to working with you on that.
3350	De Leon	Kevin	102	jjB76hKrhNA	2025	2035	Thank you very much, Madam President and colleagues. I hope you have a wonderful Monday. The next few days we will reconvene back Friday, I should say, Friday morning at 9:00 AM.
3351	Stone	Jeff	26	0J9n2c3eCds	1583	1604	Thank you Senator Pavley and expanding on Senator Allen's good comments about the cumulative facts. It's clear that the SGMA that was passed last year was to mitigate the one-and-a-half million dollar potential overdraft that we're seeing in these
3352	Leno	Mark	60	LD6QgC66xr0	159	183	But the whole idea of the fund, isn't it that those who produce oil pay into it. And then given that there are risks, which we are realizing as we speak, to our coastline when that oil is produced, that these funds would be an insurance policy of sorts to mitigate, cleanup, protect? That was traditionally the use of it, and I'm just asking.
3353	Chu	Kansen	32	H9-I5joylQw	24	48	And since we don't have a quorum here, I'd like to begin as a subcommittee, and as we're waiting for more members to arrive so we can establish a quorum. We have 11 items on the agenda today, four of which are on the consent calendar,
3354	Wolk	Lois	94	gAWN8j6c6Vc	633	649	According to the Energy Commission Transportation and Treatment of Water, treatment and disposal of wastewater and the energy used to heat and consume water account for nearly 20% of the total electricity, and 30% of non-power plant related gas consumed in California.
3355	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	7vSg9-FP5Qk	879	915	And I think you'll get a response, not only just from us, but most importantly, the public. There's a huge image problem right now and the best way to do that is to be proactive in making changes. And so again, I wanna thank Assemblymember Cooper for bringing you here, so we can continue this dialog. I think is ultimately at the end of the day, that's how we're gonna come up with the best answers. And the last thing I would tell you, the best answers I've gotten, I've said this in other committees, have come from law enforcement, especially African American law enforcement.
3356	Hernandez	Ed	103	EK6oKbTFoPo	113	138	And I'm a little concerned about a comment that was made by Finance that savings go to the general ledger, which, okay, as long as we realize that there is enough resources to efficiently and effectively, and cost effectively where the market will bear, provide the services for this segment of the population.
3357	Beall	Jim	92	qM5DAHMb8ig	1376	1397	sign up families that have kids that are already, it'd be pretty, pretty simple. And I wanted to see if that's the opinion of other people because I think the enrollment process is pretty much a standard enrollment process that's already been done for a long time in most of the large counties.
3358	Lara	Ricardo	107	YZmREa72UrQ	1112	1123	It is vital that the Conservancy Board include a representation from those cities to provide a local perspective on plans and developments. I respectively ask for your aye vote.
3359	Bonta	Rob	85	8_WRsqziEsc	703	723	get some agreement on the problem and then craft a solution. I heard, maybe you saw differently, that there was a need for additional information in certain spaces. If you agree, please share with me what your thoughts are, if you disagree, that's okay, too. I think you can hear what I'm getting at. Yes?
3360	Pan	Richard	96	ybk1adjEsig	1500	1523	Now the CDC does recommendation a immunization schedule. In fact, most physicians, actually a vast majority of physicians would say, including pediatricians, would say that they support that schedule. Yet, oftentimes, working with parents, there was actually a recent study to show that many of them do accommodate the parents in terms of modifying that schedule because they want to try to work with the families.
3361	Hill	Jerry	66	2D0v6cuDbfE	452	466	Very good, thank you very much. Others in opposition? I see no one. Back to the committee. And I appreciate the conversation on the repackaging issue. It looks like something that can easily be resolved.
3362	Hill	Jerry	66	xaot1Ks8Rhc	4	31	On sunset review and please, we'll invite the California Architects Board and Landscape Architects Technical Committee to please come forward and make yourselves as comfortable as possible, as you can in this room. Thank you for coming this afternoon and being willing to participate.
3363	Santiago	Miguel	17	Hvyw9CxPJq8	646	659	I can only imagine if they weren't within the collective bargaining unit how much easier it could be to do that. And or the, yeah that's one way to maybe patch up some of the courses.
3364	Block	Marty	59	DcIk90J9Qng	6	28	Five issues we're going to be discussing. The first deals with library, budget change proposals and the April letter. There will be a vote on that item after brief public comment. Then there will be four issues related to community colleges, the first three will not be voted on today at least that's the recommendation they be held open.
3365	Santiago	Miguel	17	Hvyw9CxPJq8	622	646	Because I was the president of a community college board for a number of years and the issue of full time faculty is a hard number to reach because the faculty obligation number's set at 75/25, but oftentimes some of the campuses and, would opt to go for the part time faculty for a number of reasons.
3366	Liu	Carol	63	U75LWC7ksak	172	198	Change takes time, but this is a very exciting time for education reform, and I'm sure all of those of you who are involved in that reform are probably tired of the word reform. But I look forward to hearing the update, as well as recommendations and how we can address the needs of our adult learners in this state, and it's changing landscape. So thank you very much.
3367	Gallagher	James	108	VKxy9ObXcUg	563	581	To be honest, I mean, as much as I've heard about it in the news, and I've seen it on all the news cycles, I still don't know what happened, in any of those cases. So, it's hard for me, as a legislator, even as an individual, to really make a judgement, or determination as to what should be different, what should've been done differently.
3368	Weber	Shirley	44	vjC4sV_362o	1259	1277	In the choir loft holding God in her throat and on lonely street corners hawking her body. And in classrooms loving our children to understanding. Standing on the world stage she sings to her loves and her beloved, to her foes and detracters.
3369	Weber	Shirley	44	_ES7C4KFvkc	581	593	That there's a, and the governor has some standards and some others have some standards or CTE. So that schools who get the money have to meet these standards that are really very high and expensive.
3370	Cooley	Ken	45	_YQzP7dcJFI	1626	1645	It is so viable that we maintain this sort of focus that this is a wide open career or they can achieve great satisfaction and to support so the excitement that gets kindled in the elementary grades and middle school is retained it sustained right to college and on a great achievements.
3371	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	j_gGP70jLkM	1115	1138	So today colleagues from 8:30 to noon, Sutter heart and vascular Institute is here giving members and staff blood pressure and health screenings and providing healthy snacks in room 444 and after session, I would invite all the women and I think a few of the men want to check it all out too. We'd love to have you.
3372	Wieckowski	Bob	55	jSkO5GUtg1k	220	255	I guess the question is, when we hear from Secretary Gonzalez, that this administration knew about this in 2011. I don't know if it's just the lax control? I know that there was a lot of chatter about fracking, and we see the graphic about there's 50,000 injection wells. Fracking is just an itsy-bitsy little bit, why the delay, why were we not told about this in 2011, 2012, 2013, why did it takes so long?
3373	Nielsen	Jim	68	jWp79DKV-DI	135	151	These days we're dealing with an awful lot more local commits because of things the state's doing. Let me back that up though. A lot have come through CDCR. If you had any recommendations that we could
3374	Quirk	Bill	23	bHho7H6wssE	819	844	One of the major arguments made was essentially the slippery slope argument, I don't buy slippery slope arguments. However, I realize as a researcher myself, that these wonderful people may sometimes cause some problems at the University and I wanted to let the universities know that if there are problems being caused and we can help, I would certainly look at that.
3375	Stone	Jeff	26	nfRac3nHOas	1209	1221	We have people in our court system now that are not willing to plea bargain at all because they say, "You know what? I'll plead guilty I'm going to go to jail."
3376	Roth	Richard	106	0wls8HR1alY	942	960	Just wanted to apologize for having to step out but I want to commend, commend you for your work on behalf of veterans. I did hear your testimony. I want to commend you for the work to eliminate some of the barriers and obstacles to jobs that folks face, specifically, including veterans.
3377	Kim	Young	82	p3k9Axcv6TA	487	503	for these high school youth, their friends are there. I want to make sure that I give enough time for our witnesses to speak, because they are the real boots on the ground. So first, I would like to turn it over to mayor from City of La Palma, Mayor Peter Kim.
3378	Cooper	Jim	21	UdyJhNk-vh8	437	455	Sure. Mr. Quirk in the bill I know we talk about taking the power away form the sheriff and having the board of sups authorize it, but the sheriff's a constitutional officer and the board of sups can't tell the sheriff how to spend his budget. He's given a budget and he spends it as he sees fit. So, I guess there's some kind of concern there I've
3379	Kim	Young	82	ullCtaxzBRw	1026	1038	Sure, thanks. One quick question is I know that the California competes program receives the many more applications than the amount of tax credits that you can you can award.
3380	Daly	Tom	118	elRk6CudldM	2284	2311	It has seven votes. The bill moves forward. Thank you, Mr. Gordon and all the participants. Miss Gaines has another commitment and she'll be back shortly. Thank you and next up is Mr. Nazarian. Is it Mr. Nazarian? Is he next in line? Great. Great, okay. I thought I heard that. Welcome.
3381	Bonta	Rob	85	q7LT4HnI37Y	533	545	Or do you continue to have concerns about this proposal not being able to provide the resources and support that will allow you to get to where we need to be in this state on these investigations?
3382	Leno	Mark	60	TUih-0idsQU	1000	1039	Okay. I would imagine it is. I'm trying to drill down to what the impact could be on purchasers. If out of that $136 billion in total revenue, let's say half of it was in non Medi-Cal. Right. So the potential impact, the $660 million, even scaling up if we did look at some kind of flat, to $900 something million, we're, in rough, rough numbers, we are talking about a 1% impact on the total marketplace.
3383	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	0HDXR-Yl1D8	748	760	You are. You are but we need to make. Since it's your first I thought I'd try to help you as subtly as I possibly could. But, at any rate, since there's no opposition. Very good.
3384	Wieckowski	Bob	55	R5jZe-4pYBI	1869	1895	And healthcare districts. So the suggested amendment which is not being accepted would, I don't want to say generic clinics, but what I think about when I say it, any 501 C3 clinic, rural, urban, whatever and the reason you're not accepting that amendment is because, I understand the research clinics, I got that the first time.
3385	Thurmond	Tony	4	adewtR6e1X4	1286	1294	We'll start by just looking at what information we have available. We'll look at different scenarios, and we'll figure out a way to have this be an ongoing conversation until we get it right.
3386	Brown	Cheryl	13	sO4d30mS8eM	28	50	Thank you Mr. Chair and Members. AB 710 would re-include youth involved in the juvenile justice system to the Local Control Funding Formula. What happened was, during a budget trailer bill session, they were dropped out. So we're asking that you will consider this bill as we move forward in the on the suspense file.
3387	McCarty	Kevin	22	JMTzvTMjSZE	978	995	Okay. With that, we will proceed with public comments from these catch all community college issues. Okay, we're going to try to ask that you keep it two-minute maximum but preferably a minute or less.
3388	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	h3qpDny4S5o	72	85	And someone in the San Gabriel Valley where everybody knows Ed Hernandes so they always call him up. but someone who's just in Pasadena or something like that may call someone in Long Beach may call someone in East Los Angeles.
3389	Lara	Ricardo	107	FUkZtNfL8Qo	1469	1483	We are still waiting on Senator Pan. This time, I am gonna present for our Senator Wolk, SB7, and I'm gonna take up my item, file Iitem SB200. Pass the gavel to my Vice Chair.
3390	Hernandez	Ed	103	mxsKkg9J8wc	215	226	Yes, Assemblymember Chau. Tell me a little bit of, was there a difference between this years or last year, tell me why title protection and was that covered in the last yea'rs bill as well?
3391	Wood	Jim	72	hGRwdCC6_e8	962	992	Yes, thank you Mr. Speaker, members I rise in of support this bill as a co author. The benefits of biomass in rural California really should go without saying. As we look forward to technologies that will help us with green house gas reduction, it's important that we do not ignore existing technologies that provide good jobs, give us greater opportunities to get rid of waste, help us thin our forests and be sustainable at the same time. So I urge your support on this bill.
3392	Liu	Carol	63	UpKpxYjD9F8	582	608	And we find that the bargaining issue is very difficult for some folks who were opposed to the bill. But there has to be buy in from teachers and you know, for us to see this, the buy in is for them to be at the table to discuss what it is that they feel that they can reach and goals that they can seek together.
3393	Liu	Carol	63	UpKpxYjD9F8	557	581	I just-- you know, evaluation is very difficult but I do know that to be effective and to-- trying to create a system that honors the work of teachers, it's-- it is very difficult and I-- you know, so we're trying to create a system that rewards or continuously improves the craft of teaching.
3394	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	_0FvACJKmKc	9	21	Thank you very much. Comments, questions by members. Senator Monning and then was it Senator Moorlach, did you raise your hand. Senator Anderson, no. All right, Senator Monning, the floor is yours.
3395	Quirk	Bill	23	Hfoe3X0tet8	1529	1550	Good morning, Mr. Chair and my Senator. And all Senators here this morning, it's just good to see you all. I'd like to first start by accepting the committee amendment contained on page seven of the analysis to refer broadly to state wide greenhouse gas emission limits.
3396	McGuire	Mike	93	oFD3dFY_sMo	1599	1618	Thank you so much senator. I appreciate those words. Thank you very much. Would like to be able to look to the left here and see if any of the senators would like to have any comments or questions. Okay. And we're going to open it up for any additional folks in our support and or oppose, please.
3397	Wagner	Donald	88	uR7IVED3sSY	1535	1554	I'll jump into this. Just yesterday, on the floor, we passed a bill making it easier to have district elections. Just last November the author of the prior, bills Senator Padilla,  was put into office as the Secretary of State, oversees elections.
3398	Wieckowski	Bob	55	QkQlxH8U7IE	711	731	Page 4 of 5. The analysis talks about the First Amendment, what the Constitution protects. We're supposed to pass laws that restrict,t that may restrict the First Amendment. But if they're content neutral, and they're viewpoint neutral, then they're okay. They pass the constitutional mustard.
3399	Leno	Mark	60	nj31ZcgCRww	722	747	But I just want you to look at the facts and look at what's happening, and if you care about the health and the future of our children. It's a lot about the health of our children that we're here today. I hope you'll agree about why we are doing what we are doing. So with that, I would like to introduce our speakers.
3400	Hueso	Ben	48	vwnSyW8C-l8	10	22	You know, in February California moved ahead of Brazil as the seventh largest economy in the world. This is a state. That is the largest state with largest economy in the world.
3401	Block	Marty	59	t4_AyYAahhk	369	381	And while access may be cut a bit by this, I think successful completion will increase, because you'll have full-time faculty who students can go to with their academic needs so I'll be supporting this bill.
3402	Gallagher	James	108	rek1UfAle3c	1454	1471	For each fiscal year the program is funded, to be made available only to tax, to a taxpayer whose project or business is located, or proposed to be located, in a county, city, or a metropolitan area with a 10% unemployment rate or higher.
3403	Bonta	Rob	85	skOoMkG_5XA	1206	1220	Thank you Assembly Member Gordon, we can entertain a motion. We have a motion. And a second. Madam Secretary please call the roll. The motion is due passed as amended to appropriations.
3404	Cannella	Anthony	61	5WD5y8t5m5U	907	915	So, I would be willing to support the audit if we took it up, you know, after the district attorney made their final decision. At this point, I cannot.
3405	Hill	Jerry	66	4Ls4aOm_vdA	1007	1017	These straightforward means of oversight would incentivize the PUC to be very clear on the purpose and scope of any proposal to spend money on criminal defense. I respectfully ask for an aye vote members.
3406	Atkins	Toni	110	nhED5L0HREU	342	363	Members, I am looking forward to working with you, and as I look around this chamber, I see an Assembly that has one very big difference from the one that I joined four years ago; most of you have an opportunity to be here for 10 or 12 years, and that means there's a greater opportunity to develop expertise to take a more in-depth approach.
3407	Pavley	Fran	104	Q93W3yN07bU	757	769	State Parks is under the jurisdiction of this Committee we have several departments that need our reaction and response during the next few months. This is available to do just that.
3408	Hancock	Loni	98	t-uCy9GJSIM	821	838	Which again, fits... I think the idea of implicit bias gives us greater understanding about that. But is there information that you needed that was not available to you?
3409	Weber	Shirley	44	7i9bh_kaYv0	50	65	The legislature this year, as well as in past years, has made early education a priority. Over the past few years, we have done much to increase the access to preschool programs that develop us academically as well as socially.
3410	Bates	Pat	58	-z6iX7gB4pQ	1248	1259	I'd like to ask a question. I think a lot of the testimony, it was stated a couple of times that this is a solution in search of a problem.
3411	Gallagher	James	108	_b18tzFsHIo	814	830	Members I also arise in opposition to this bill. I'm sure all of us in this room care about students and we want to see and make ensure they succeed and they've all the information available to them.
3412	Atkins	Toni	110	nhED5L0HREU	300	315	Assembly Member Miguel Santiago went to UCLA. In all, 10 new Assembly members attended a UC school. We need you to help us keep UC affordable and attainable for every California student.
3413	Weber	Shirley	44	5kU8DLIkLSI	620	634	Okay. All right. Sounds good. I know the Ed committee spent a lot of time with higher ed, with UC issues and CSU as well as K-12. And there's a lot of other pieces that go into it.
3414	Alejo	Luis	9	0LdXFnPqPCk	591	610	Here in California we had three counties that were subject to pre-clearance: Yuba, Kings, and Monterey County in my district, but here we are two years later, and our Congress has yet to act to reinstitute a new formula to bring back those important civil rights protections.
3415	Bloom	Richard	2	-bJq_JGSuxY	2476	2500	Yes, Mr. Chair, this bill does not mandate how utilities achieve the goals of energy efficiency. It recognizes that the Governor has asked us to jump further and to achieve more. In order to do that, the best way is for the legislature rather than the PUC to take hold of this program which, at this time, involves already a billion dollars in rate pair money,
3416	Cannella	Anthony	61	8GUUuCOIXCY	790	807	I think there's real problems. I think what we've talked about with minority students but with all students. I've got many kids in my district that are very bright that cannot get into UC. I'm a graduate of UC Davis. I went there because I played football, that's the reason I got into the college.
3417	Alejo	Luis	9	0LdXFnPqPCk	560	575	But it was this most important and most transformative piece of legislation that came out of the civil rights movement but that has recently come under attack and there have been efforts to erode those hard-fought civil rights protections.
3418	Harper	Matthew	14	LfirS3-TAVM	173	200	Well, and not only that, but sometimes you have goals that may seem like they're appropriate for most college districts. But the availability or workability in terms of implementation of full-time versus part-time faculty may not work with some districts, you know, well, in a suburban district or in urban district, you may have a lot-- a very large talent poll that's available. But in some districts you might not.
3419	Allen	Travis	43	6nzz0SRNk10	852	870	So not only will this bill help our world renowned coast, but the funds will go to help the California Coastal Conservancy and I will specifically look at protecting our California sea lions who are showing up on our beaches in record numbers due to poor health. With that, I respectfully ask your aye vote on AB 192.
3420	McGuire	Mike	93	_BbXW7wLano	1735	1754	just a quick note Mr. President, Molly Murphy McGregor who founded this important month back in 1977 will be in Sacramento and we'll be hosting a morning reception in her honor later this month. And again I want to say thank you Senator Jackson for bringing this forward.
3421	Bonta	Rob	85	81AHHgExKGE	897	908	Each side has six minutes. They split it up two minutes apiece. So you could continue. You'll just have less time for your second witness. You're at 3:30 now.
3422	De Leon	Kevin	102	Gcdptg51L2I	1680	1698	As a State of immigrants, we are also finally extending fundamental rights to those who come here who play by the rules and who contribute to this great economy. We passed a landmark vaccination law that protects the rights of children to be safe at school and in day-care.
3423	Beall	Jim	92	8y2PS2BPMgc	6	39	So, we can begin. Okay, we need our author to come in, so we could start.  We'd like to call the meeting to order. This is the Transportation and Housing Committee. Senate Committee. And we'd like to take roll, please.
3424	Thurmond	Tony	4	2brqaJJ9EWY	1080	1098	but I think it's fair to say it, we're just not prepared. And I don't want us to have to find out the hard way how long mutual aid is gonna take. So my answer today is unacceptable. We're not prepared. Let us get prepared. Come back and share with us plans for how we will be better prepared,
3425	Patterson	Jim	119	UDPqIWouyOQ	1878	1915	Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Again, two of my children teach in public schools. We live this regularly at home at the dinner table and when we visit each other. These two teachers are wonderful, they are fully committed to teaching their kids and as I've mentioned on this floor before, when the 'ah ha' moment comes, it is a real enjoyment and a moment for them to celebrate
3426	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	g465sM88Jms	2252	2275	So I'm not picking on anyone. I actually the, the people that this is targeted towards, have been, for the most part, responsible employers for a very long time in our state. Right? But they're under pressure; they're the ones that are under pressure from hedge funds and from Wall Street to, to break up and sell a lot of their assets.
3427	Galgiani	Cathleen	95	h0Gkdxuepz8	1784	1806	First of all, I'd like to thank the Chair for allowing me to be here in the Committee today. I have two of these schools in my district, and we actually had a workshop last week inviting students to come. And we had representatives from the student aid commission, and from EDD because there are employees that have lost their jobs like that as well.
3428	Weber	Shirley	44	nY2N1xKF-1M	179	187	The meeting is called to order. The first budget meeting for 2015 is here by called to order. I would like to ask our secretary to call the roll.
3429	Hernandez	Ed	103	o6dY6yB1_H8	810	826	But in order to truly be revolutionary, coverage must be accompanied by meaningful access to a provider. Unfortunately, millions of Californians in the Medi-Cal program lack the access because we pay providers an embarrassingly low rate.
3430	Gatto	Mike	46	uUsytMtXn1I	1280	1296	Yes. So I had a daughter born in the last couple years. This is the pamphlet that you??re given. You're typically handed this. You can't say with uniformity that there is a different point that every different hospital whatever, follows it. But you're given this during a very emotional time.
3431	Alejo	Luis	9	SHuB-iUXJvo	421	436	witnesses that which would be the key issue in this type of hearing is whether the person was actually served or not. And then the last concern was on the amendments and I know you worked with the banking committee. And it's only on this language, which I think it's incumbent that we have to have a tight language,
3432	Wagner	Donald	88	4lx0MqjDD6Q	1828	1861	I will begin by sharing my friend from Watsonville's absolute outrage. As did everybody in this room, I'm sure, to the horrific murders a couple of weeks ago. It's a non-sequitur to say, and therefore we we need to take Robert E Lee's name off of our schools. And the author to his credit recognizes that. That this bill does not bring about racial harmony and does not do a whole lot other than perhaps send a message.
3433	Leno	Mark	60	Pt2Dhj6vkoE	1664	1682	I'm gonna jump in real quickly, just because we're late for the floor. We've gone over all this and I'm just gonna try and do it in shorthand. We were told that we do have a $72 billion unfunded liability for retiree health care costs currently. That with the reform in these two bargaining units, with the expectation it will be replicated throughout all of the upcoming negotiations with the other bargaining units.
3434	Weber	Shirley	44	BMNgYibzIuk	1253	1268	So forth and so on. So the thought was that we would support their efforts to get this research done in an impartial way through UCLA. Which is what they're trying to get done, and then that too would be, as you point out, something that we would look at statewide as we grapple with this issue,
3435	Leno	Mark	60	CqHNKdxXueg	160	207	And then with regard to disciplinary policies, under current law, a charter school is not required to list in detail its policies for suspending or expelling pupils in its petition to become a charter school. Charter schools are also exempted from following the existing statutory due process protections relating to the suspension and expulsion of students at public schools. As a result, charter school students can be denied their right to due process. It's not surprising that the data collected by the United States Department of Education demonstrates that suspensions and expulsions occur at a far higher rate at charter schools than traditional public schools.
3436	Hueso	Ben	48	xrb7OkoktfM	1652	1685	over a popular incumbent in a district that was only 8% Latino at the time. He would go on to have a distinguished career in the Legislature, never lost an election in 22 years. Generations of Latino legislators like myself are indebted to trailblazers like Mr. Chacon. His style made it so that everybody in his district felt like they had a personal relationship with their Assemblymember, and my father boasted that he
3437	De Leon	Kevin	102	YGvsvPIzjxQ	68	85	Thank you so very much. Good afternoon, Mr. Chair, as well as colleagues of the Assembly Education Committee. It's an honor to be here with each and every one of you. I am proud to present SB 695 jointly, authored by my very good friend and colleague, Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson.
3438	Kim	Young	82	ZXZJp00flVo	1306	1321	Sure, Mr. Chairman, I'm going to lay off on the Proposition 98 package today, because it's based on the revenue projections that far exceeds the governor's proposal. This issue should be worked out in conference committee.
3439	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	FA0o_dng1YE	1631	1646	Replicating a similar model at the state level would create access and opportunity for approximately 1.5 million Californians eligible for differed action programs. Finally I want to highlight that this fund is contingent on two critical factors.
3440	Wood	Jim	72	0uNprUHid34	46	62	As a trustee the district is allowed to use revenue generated from it's trust lands to purchase and dispose of after acquired lands. A provision the districts' granting statute prevents them from transferring irrevocable grants and fee title. I should have just stopped when I was ahead here.
3441	Gomez	Jimmy	80	2b3SgDbb8jI	1796	1811	Thank you.  Any other individuals in support? Witnesses in opposition? Individuals from the public in opposition? Seeing none, questions or comments from the committee members? Seeing none, Mr. Thurmond, would you like to close?
3442	Wieckowski	Bob	55	ilwRLhZLtAc	1219	1235	Given the changing environment that we have, is that adequate simply to get through eight hours of legal training at the beginning, and then simply renew your permit with some field discharge training?
3443	Allen	Benjamin	70	YFmVbaB_4iY	931	958	I used to work for the United Nations in East Africa, and I was so grateful of the fact that I was able to go to the doctor, get vaccinated, and get the shots to protect me from the dangerous diseases that existed there. I continue to be grateful that I grew up fully vaccinated, that I grew up in a society that actually took the steps necessary to protect our young people, our children, from dangerous communicable diseases that continue to impact people all over the world today.
3444	Wood	Jim	72	cFLwRY925G8	463	476	I believe that healthcare is one of those things that is a foundational, a piece for how we get along in society. Healthcare impacts how we are successful in our education, healthcare impacts how our economy is successful.
3445	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	itjqf4OHel4	216	234	Many of us have not had to risk losing our job to care for a loved one with a serious illness, but life happens. And we wanna ensure that Californians can keep their jobs and keep contributing to our economy, while taking on the added burden and responsibility.
3446	Mitchell	Holly	64	ISFND_-5pCw	881	894	A year ago, almost exact to the day. And they were disappointed in these three areas. Promoting rate design, that rewards energy hogs. Two, promoting incentives for gas fire technology.
3447	Beall	Jim	92	B0PWp2aeSfk	1739	1749	I'm only saying that I'm telling you that I want to see bang for the buck, you have to show me. And don't say that I'm trying to release prisoners early, okay?
3448	Patterson	Jim	119	37JGlYuk31E	281	330	It is an overreach of government, even of the best of intentions, particularly in light of the high number of volunteer vaccination rate in California, the declining personal exemptions that we saw since 2109, and I think there's been an absence of evidence that the small number of unvaccinated have caused or are responsible for an epidemic or a health emergency, I think that really stretches the facts to the point I think of really almost being a scare tactic. This is troubling to me.
3449	Bates	Pat	58	jsJrqv78Trc	1030	1047	So, those will be the things that I'm looking at. And any resource, since I'm new, I'm not new from the county where we were dealing with the impact versus how to solve the problem, it would be very helpful if you could provide me and my staff some more in-depth on those basic issues.
3450	Garcia	Cristina	112	ZW0bBeI7WzQ	101	120	And I know we're talking about how do we discuss this during the recess. The reality of what apartments look like in my district. And when I have discussions, when I bring it up here, we think about these big units. In your head, think about where you're thinking about multi-family homes. And you're thinking about 50-plus units oftentimes, maybe bigger.
3451	Hancock	Loni	98	Laqdju9yTYg	978	1012	Thank you. Finally, Senator Monning before he left, indicated that he was interested in knowing if there's any technology that can be used to render contraband cellphones ineffective. And Senator Andersen indicated that he was interested in more concrete data and who's been apprehended for drugs or for cellphones. So we know more about where it's coming from.
3452	Beall	Jim	92	DT3707YnrIQ	260	288	And it's now four years in and we use no water, basically, on the front yard. It has got plenty of butterflies, birds, it's wonderful. It's a joy compared to a lawn and I think if designed properly it will reduce the heat, which is kind of what happened in our house.
3453	Weber	Shirley	44	NTCK9Uu4-ME	401	413	Each time, standards need to be updated, new legislation must be enacted. Review and update of this standard is necessary due to changes in disciplinary knowledge and academic research, even if only minor changes are there.
3454	Wieckowski	Bob	55	5L0obLeeOIE	728	740	Can you, before you're done, Senator Pavley's introductory remarks was that all the other western states have public well notification. How is that so if it's in conflict with federal law?
3455	Gipson	Mike	28	l95CGtQiXY4	243	256	Thank you, Mr. Chair and thank you for convenience I should speak since I'm probably the problem child to get us all here today and let.me let me just state I didn't get here to have an audit just off a whim
3456	Nielsen	Jim	68	6RcHSaSd1rw	547	569	Ladies and gentlemen of the senate. This legislation and predecessor, the 261. In effect, allows violent, dangerous offenders as old as 18 to get out of jail early, of prison early.
3457	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	npLG8Ena6eQ	1422	1453	Now the beauty of all this image that we as a legislative body should in fact protect people so that when they do make their choices they are making them freely. They are making them without coercion and that's what this bill does. And, that is the only role we should play in this discussion so I submit that we're talking about end-of-life decisions.
3458	Gomez	Jimmy	80	rOcxPrNyERc	914	934	This is a bill that reflects the changing structure of our family. You know, we are our brothers and sisters keepers literally. If we have a sibling that gets sick, we should feel some responsibility to want to go and take care of them.
3459	Williams	Das	12	pab-ZAwjcmA	386	409	The intention is to have designated sites with monument plaques along the trail. He was working on this project with Kevin Clerici, Executive Director of Downtown Ventura Partners. He was a thinker. He was one of those brilliant people that sometimes spend a lot of time coming up with great ideas.
3460	Hancock	Loni	98	uM-vqP4Hv8s	1441	1468	And that that is not a contracting with the private company, the university negotiating employment within individual and I'm assuming that that is not part of something that the bill would cover, that that person would typically be paid whatever the university pays nurse practitioners if the author could just comment.
3461	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	9eA3HqZp1ws	1782	1795	Thank you, Senator Bates. Please do extend those condolences and best wishes, and if you would make sure that the name is brought to the desk so we can properly memorialize it. Senator Nielsen.
3462	De Leon	Kevin	102	P8iQl0Ig1eQ	1514	1537	Obviously, we have judiciary as well as approps before it gets to floor. Dialog is continuing in a very constructive manner and it is dramatically different from last year's version. At least, the atmosphere if you will, obviously the content that the atmosphere surrounding the measure itself, because last year, obviously it failed to pass to the floor on the Senate side last year.
3463	Wieckowski	Bob	55	SHuB-iUXJvo	742	764	is that in order to get the judgement after you have a default, you haven't had your trial, it's not evidence that has gone in, you just filed your complaint and nobody's refiled, there's a file there. So we hope that you can support this bill so that due process in California will be strengthened
3464	Wolk	Lois	94	iRcV3DgKWQw	1	17	I appreciate that and I want to ask Mr. Wilson what he thought about that, that we're misidentifying essentially the cost, the causes of the problems in the delta. The dangers of that.
3465	Bates	Pat	58	vjd6Y9hnzuc	1028	1045	I just wanted to make a comment. I'm recently off the Orange County Board of Supervisors where we had a couple of these infectious epidemics and I was very impressed with the manner in which our county responded. And I also served twice on a drill that FEMA put on for our county.
3466	Gomez	Jimmy	80	0KJVRFCFgZY	463	487	We look at it a direct impact on the general fund as it stands today and in the future years, but not maybe if, and sort of, kind of analysis. It's really what kind of impact is it going to have at this moment? So you bill does have a minor cost we're gonna, it has a do pass recommendation with a motion from Quirk,
3467	Quirk	Bill	23	Oc8_cozASuQ	1302	1325	It is noon and we all have to get to our caucus meetings. This has been a very productive panel. I want to thank you all for being here. I particularly would like to thank the judge for very specific recommendations. And we will certainly have PORAC totally involved with any discussions going forward. You can be sure of that. Thank you.
3468	Gaines	Beth	109	elq7nOJOh90	626	644	In 1976, he started his career at the LAO. After 20 years at the LAO, Peter served under state treasurer Matt Fong as assistant state treasure and as Executive Director of the California debt and investment advisory Commission.
3469	Beall	Jim	92	12bt77nSPXs	332	359	And we have some laws already on the books that we could do that. Senator Liu has a bill that she's now going through to process that deals with mental health in inmates that have no health issues, Senator Liu's bill. So I think other options are available. I'd like to see some other options explored rather than what's proposed here in the budget.
3470	Maienschein	Brian	84	0uNprUHid34	1448	1465	Did Senator Lara write those remarks for you? Witnesses in opposition? Seeing none, it is, Senator, an excellent bill please do support it today. We have a motion and a second. Any questions or comments from the committee? Seeing none. You may close.
3471	Mitchell	Holly	64	NwesQVgY4qI	1542	1559	So I appreciate the more relevant, narrower focus of your testimony and opposition. Again like I said, there's a movement afoot to really take a look at how relevant grand juries continue to be in our current society.
3472	Levine	Marc	8	AJJV4Jngl_c	911	927	I wanna jump right in to a question that came up early in your presentation which is, the Water Commission and ensuring accountability on the 2.7 billion dollars with which they've been entrusted to spend wisely. Can you comment on that?
3473	Liu	Carol	63	uggbUvzVWb8	726	752	It's a much more complicated situation and, as Senator Leyva indicated, there is no compensation for somebody who just is dismissed if it's a classified person etc. So you're just touching a very small part of a much larger issue. And with that, is there a motion? Did somebody move the bill? Bill has been moved by Senator Leyva. Let's call the roll.
3474	Thurmond	Tony	4	dQgHkZmLQFo	80	112	As many of you know, methane gas is 84 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. For the first 20 years after it's released, it's classified as a short-lived climate pollutant with a lifetime of approximately 12 years when released into the atmosphere. Methane gas has long lasting impacts as an extremely potent greenhouse gas with 20 to 30 times the warming power of carbon dioxide over a hundred year period and more than 80 times over a 20 year period.
3475	Brough	William	111	dfinQbvsuZo	734	743	Thank you Mr. Speaker and members, I rise in support of 1383. As a veteran and someone who's used the preference on the Federal level, I think we should bring this to the state level.
3476	Atkins	Toni	110	mOqF8MknDiY	244	261	California has 24% of the nation's homeless veterans and a third of the nation's chronically homeless. The state also has the largest numbers of unaccompanied homeless children and youth, with 30% of the national total.
3477	Huff	Bob	105	L_nqL1xdfS8	862	886	which took affect January 1st of this year, cannot because they cannot obtain the necessary prescription. SB 738 will provide limited liability protection for prescribing physicians writing standing order prescriptions, in order to comply with SB 1266 which is the stock epinephrine in schools. And it is similar to current law as it relates as said to the liability for AEDs and opioid antagonists.
3478	Salas	Rudy	34	np2bbuatBtE	44	68	Thank you Madam Chair, members, Assembly bill 1201 requires the California Department of Fish and Wildlife to develop and initiate an initiative. A science based approach that helps address predation by non native species on endangered Delta species. With me today to speak in support is Kathy Cole with the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, also Paramount as well.
3479	Wolk	Lois	94	7ULUe19PTjQ	1646	1661	I do. Just a brief comment. Senator Stone, I appreciate you bringing this forward. And I look forward to your continuing to work with the opposition in particular the CMA and the CNA to see if you can come to a good place in terms of oversight.
3480	Stone	Jeff	26	EkjCB3EukYI	824	849	hoping to see him recovering in the recovery room, only to have the physician come in and say that they unfortunately couldn't save this wonderful man who addicted to smoking, was a multi pack smoker. And, I believe that it was the smoking that took this man's life. So, I hope as a legacy for many of us, they're potentially going to be for years
3481	Pan	Richard	96	6KgzpeS3bCM	990	1001	Despite being one the largest hospital chains in the state Prime had an unusually high number of cases where the police were called on patients in the emergency room, in fact, as much as 6-fold compared to some other hospitals.
3482	Pan	Richard	96	6KgzpeS3bCM	1001	1019	For example, during the first three months of 2014, a 124 emergency call came from the Shasta Regional Medical Center which is a Prime a hospital. This averages to about 41 calls a month, another Prime hospital, Desert Valley Hospital at 509 emergency calls in the first 6 months of 2014 averaging about 60 calls per month.
3483	Morrell	Mike	51	ze-YP1FOzwQ	1035	1065	And so these commitments are so massive that they already are crowding out some of our most basic government services that we rely on schools roads police fire protection and other things and so to force this increases administrative costs and tends decrease investment returns for our retirees. We should not use re people's retirements savings to target companies and industries that the legislatures happen not to like.
3484	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	519YUTER2IM	1628	1649	Yeah, the amendments clarify what the requirement's going to be, what the CEC and the PUC are required to look at and that they are not to do anything that will undermine the opportunity for more renewables and will not undermine the existing, let's see with the language is.
3485	Calderon	Ian Charles	115	HBHfaes5iio	1683	1695	When, when these ballots are returned unsigned, who is it that? Is it the registrar recorder's responsibility to then go and contact these individuals to remind them? And how are they contacting them? Are they calling them?
3486	Weber	Shirley	44	Dxgt5Ah1FGM	525	564	And so that becomes a major issue, because this is something that communities look at, that's a small ask, and others see it as a great bother. And so where do we find this middle ground? Because communities feel that their vulnerable and others feel that this is a bothersome task for the job that they have to do. And I understand it is somewhat bothersome because you have to collect data, but at the same time we've got a critical issue here that has to be resolved in all of our communities and something that we have to look at very carefully and make sure that we're going to respond to it and, hopefully, our members recognize the fact that this is not a fleeting issue.
3487	Burke	Autumn	6	CVYbaFO-ROE	557	574	Using this data will serve as a valuable tool to ensure vendor quality but also to ensure that California has an accurate picture of the vendor it is entering into a contract with. I understand there are many factors that have contributed to our state's failed IT projects, and that is why I've also been working with the industry expert on Assembly Bill 805.
3488	Hancock	Loni	98	ClzH1O0Q12s	674	697	What enhanced treatment program means is yes locked doors which we agree are necessary, but, we've explored. How is this different from solitary confinement? Well it would be different if they're was therapeutic program that came along with it.
3489	Allen	Benjamin	70	MpQ4SGzO7GE	442	455	You know, that would give Airbnb the notice, so as to, you know, so that and they would, and apparently, you know, at least from my reading of the bill. And, you know, we got some other attorneys here on the committee I know you're a committee lawyer as well.
3490	De Leon	Kevin	102	8L1SsBHKNBQ	2	13	I wanna welcome you to the Senate Rules Committee. It is Wednesday, June 17th. It is approximately 1:33 PM. Colleagues, why don't we start by establishing a quorum. Madam Secretary, please call the role.
3491	Pavley	Fran	104	fZNtPr5bhc4	1028	1047	'Cuz I'm thinking third or fourth year of record drought and the possibility of, in rainy years, hopefully we will see them again, that that water table's going to be expanding and how you map it now may not be relevant 10 years from now?
3492	Quirk	Bill	23	8AAoooSnIWE	472	486	And that was a motion by Jones-Sawyer with the second by our Vice-Chair. Madame Vice-Chair? No comment. Oh, you didn't second it. Oh you have a question. Is there? Alright I will second the bill. Alright, please ask your question.
3493	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	HgBIr1hupMw	399	425	And when you've taken care of infants in 0-2s you realize they are a full time job. They sleep when they want and not when you want, and they're up when they want and not when you want. And that's just the beginning of the iceberg. At the current reimbursement rate families have limited access to childcare options because they can only choose from about 50% of the providers and have their costs totally covered.
3494	Allen	Benjamin	70	MpQ4SGzO7GE	455	471	You know, it seems to me that, that you, every time the city wanted to shut down a particular potential, provider. They would have to write a letter to Airbnb and ask them to take that person off of the off, off of the portal.
3495	Chau	Ed	116	vXz2QoNROUo	818	843	Good job, thank you very much. Now, if there are no further questions, I'd like to thank the two ladies. You're welcome to stay at the desk if you so desire, while I invite the next speaker to come on up. The next speaker is Mr. Mark Stivers, who is the executive director of the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee, CTCAC for short. Mr. Stivers, any time you are ready you may proceed.
3496	Dababneh	Matthew	50	GYqLytCM9KA	356	373	The exchange and storage companies that lost these funds no insurance or other protections to back up these losses for consumers. Today, if you lose money in an insured financial institution you are covered by some basic protections, such as $250,000 and FDIC insurance. If you use a money transmission service, a licensed entity must have sufficient capital to cover any potential losses on the money being transferred.
3497	Alejo	Luis	9	yLYXPq0fwvY	1585	1598	Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members. First of all, we came to Sacramento to help solve problems. This is one of those bills that's been deliberated on for many years. We took this on to hopefully solve this problem once and for all.
3498	Hernandez	Ed	103	mkixEOc2Tj4	22	37	And a total of nine minutes, so there's three minutes per individual, after that we're going to take only name only support, and or oppose. I did make an exception for special order number one, but we will be going with the three and three. Senator Leno, please proceed, thank you.
3499	Hernandez	Ed	103	o6dY6yB1_H8	2489	2505	But I think that this is an opportunity for us in the Senate to kind of shape what we want and how we want to see this. Whether it's another one-year extension or not, the time has come. And obviously the administration definitely wants to stop the reauthorization of it.
3500	Alejo	Luis	9	HZaArTsCL5U	1478	1511	Specifically, I want to recognize Philip Veracruz  for his efforts across the world because after he retired from the UFW, Philip became the international face for democracy in the Philippines. He was a spokesman for democracy, civil rights, and anti-racism.
3501	De Leon	Kevin	102	NPktHkkmjlQ	241	259	this policy that helped create the policy debate here in Sacramento. So I want to give you a special recognition that is well deserved for carrying a heavy load last year. With that, obviously we have the supporters in favor of the measure, as well as I believe we'll have tweeners or folks that are neutral. With that, Mr. Chair, I simply ask for an aye vote.
3502	Allen	Benjamin	70	u0-ac-4sGAg	550	570	This addresses both the gap in regulatory authority and also clearly insures that California's regulatory program is in line with federal protections. So when the department first issued its environmental impact report on suction dredge mining regulations in 2012,  The department recognized that it did not have the authority to regulate impacts to public health, water quality, or cultural sites.
3503	Roth	Richard	106	4mB1nCFXohc	903	924	I apologize for since it's five to four but this is a little different then what I remember from the subcommittee hearing, and let me just sort of outline what I think I understood, and then you all can correct me if I'm wrong. And I'll try to put a question at the end so it's not a speech, but a question.
3504	Bonilla	Susan	3	HBOX_ihiZFg	443	452	And I do believe though, that certainly as we're sitting here, our hope is that we're gonna be able to communicate this to our colleagues. How very important it is.
3505	Nguyen	Janet	65	gDPCmEU7pmg	268	287	Okay. So, well because Redevelopment Agency was created for citywide and the agency itself was able to identify certain areas. You stated here though that two out of five members will be from the affected areas. So how is this gonna work?
3506	Gordon	Richard	117	d1S1T4q9GVM	1088	1106	Let me do close by commenting on the concerns raised by Ms. Grady. We've taken an amendment that we think partially addresses those concerns. We also believe that the federal Good Samaritan Food Donation Act also provides a level of protection.
3507	Moorlach	John	4657	qnIAoFuwUn0	1130	1158	 And then. You have a death financing for all of your programs that the general fund pays, the debt service. And I'm, I'm curious now with Prop 98 looking a little more robust why, why does the general fund continue to take on the debt payment for the community colleges? Why doesn't this budget now start to take on its own debt service.
3508	Dababneh	Matthew	50	1ULf869aoVg	1033	1048	Good-morning, Mr. Speaker and colleagues. AB147 is a straightforward bipartisan measure that is reasonable and humane to allow research animals to retire once they've been included in the process for tax funded payer research. By allowing them to be placed for adoption of the conclusion of this research.
3509	Pan	Richard	96	AtJ4r5Cv5ko	368	382	And may I respond, Mr. Chair. Yes, so there'll be a total of-- our success would be, we would have no one smoking, we would not raise a dime of revenue from this bill and taxpayers would not be paying the cost of tobacco related diseases.
3510	Hertzberg	Robert	99	_rncMVWCV9g	426	438	What's the most cost efficient, least intrusive in other aspects of government. Most efficient, most quick thing to do it with the most intelligent greeting concepts? How do you do this in a period of, say, five years?
3511	Holden	Chris	78	5xjBSsaNwEY	961	979	However, this bill is not just about saving the state money, it's about changing lives. AB 1162 will ensure all patients have easy access to these life changing services. It's for these reasons that I ask for your aye vote.
3512	Atkins	Toni	110	WR_bP6j3vkM	1292	1312	I'm pleased to bring before you assembly bill 1288 which recognizes the importance of continuing California's greenhouse gas emission reduction efforts after 2020. Specifically, AB 1288 clarifies the ongoing role of market based mechanisms and helping to meet our green house gas reduction goals.
3513	McCarty	Kevin	22	eYTxGLtgMco	2146	2168	Sure, thanks Mr. Chair. I know we have a, a motion in a second, and I'll just be brief of the committed and uncommitted peace. But but I know this is not a, a black and white issue. There's a, there's a lot of, of grey in the middle, and you know, on its face, it seems that that a reserve such as we've heard from LAUSD not to pick on them, of 1%.
3514	Steinorth	Marc	35	2W00giXvusA	871	886	up to five years, for up to three years that you would have to then restart back to a full license. This body, I believe, is looking at possibly amending it to where you could go from the retired, to the retired active. Which I believe is something we'd be very open to discuss.
3515	Leno	Mark	60	l9ONzDCnLn4	56	73	Curious, how would we provide for the California Library Services Act, the Career Online High School Program, and the Broadband Equipment Grants with the assembly funding which is zero?
3516	Allen	Travis	43	DT3707YnrIQ	1023	1035	I'm here today to present AB 679, it's a very simple bill. It was brought to me by a constituent who highlighted the problem being encountered when trying to submit documents regarding a property that he was transferring and officially recording with the county.
3517	Leno	Mark	60	zr4fqdcgBEU	1200	1222	And let him know, one way or the other I can't tell you. I know where my vote is on an MCO tax. I'm not going to speak for anyone else. I can't know for certain where the final number will be. But one way or the other we have to take action. And we have to do more than has been pointed out, provide lip service to this community before this summer is out.
3518	Leno	Mark	60	R0xKhCYzBZA	1658	1689	It's not clear to me if the bill applies just to water wholesalers or just to retailers, and whether the intent of the bill only applies to the consolidation of two retail water systems or the forcing of water agencies to take a new wholesale customer. Can you respond to that, please?
3519	Hill	Jerry	66	LVzFkfmZq9U	228	248	SB 34 focuses on the use of license plate readers by entities that are not regulated by current law. The bill takes reasonable steps to make sure Californian's civil liberties and privacy are respected and protected, while still balancing law enforcement's ability to use license plate readers to catch criminals.
3520	Hall	Isadore	1	H5As3s88-Eg	1282	1306	If I'm wrong for introducing such legislation, then I'm wrong for assisting poor communities and disadvantaged communities for helping non-profits try to provide services to their community. And I will do this today, and I'll do it tomorrow, and I'll stand up for it again next month, if I have to, but as we spoke earlier, our communities are hurting, non-profits are struggling, trying to keep their doors open to find ends meet.
3521	Thurmond	Tony	4	cFLwRY925G8	350	363	Sadly, I'm gonna have to leave this meeting very soon because we're having a meeting today to talk about a hospital that mostly serves MediCal patients and, that is on the verge of closure within weeks, if not days.
3522	Gallagher	James	108	9Kkq97ccCr8	1280	1294	Well I appreciate that you're moving in this direction of trying to limit it, because I think when we started off it was 10% across the board, right? So when that started out we were talking about high wage earners too would get the same benefits.
3523	Mullin	Kevin	31	toyLEHK5bMU	2222	2240	Members, ask for your attention. I have some announcements to make regarding Committee meetings. The following committees will meets at the recess: the Budget Committee will meet in Rome 4202. Budget Committee in 4202. Governmental Organization will meet in room 437, that's GO in 437.
3524	Hancock	Loni	98	PR6Aqie0NK4	1292	1306	Because, you know, it would be really, really good if we could have a whole hearing, I think, on---. I don't even know how much money is spent in California elections anymore and what's happened since Citizens United, and really to get a---.
3525	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	51wXJ30ZLf4	1485	1502	Until such a comprehensive state regulatory scheme is enacted, the medical cannabis industry will continue to be stuck in the middle between inconsistent oversight, or regulations at the local level, and constant federal action despite compliance with local rules.
3526	Weber	Shirley	44	Vh_5v2RZyR4	448	468	The understanding on our part was that we would not relinquish the funds without an exchange for their taking over the bridge and the maintenance of the bridge, that we would not just give them $15 million for the repair that they would need in order to do the rails and what have you.
3527	Bloom	Richard	2	C5FKcnZ9gio	51	66	Nationally, one out of every five deaths is attributable to smoking and in California, 40,000 people lose their lives to tobacco related illness each year, and tens of thousands of Californian's struggle every day because of tobacco related illness.
3528	Hill	Jerry	66	ChbIO5XT7O8	1115	1127	Thank you, Madame President and members. I introduced SB24 to regulate electronic cigarettes because a growing number of youths are using the devices, which deliver high addictive nicotine. Use of E cigarettes has more than doubled, rising from 3.1% in 2011 to 6.5% in 2012.
3529	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	51wXJ30ZLf4	1470	1485	However, California has fallen behind the rest of the nation and failed to implement a comprehensive licensing. And regulatory structure to ensure patient access and protect our environment, public safety, and public health.
3530	Garcia	Eduardo	38	qrJj2d7lUww	2113	2133	Okay, thank you, we'll leave the call open for the other members. Item four is AB 19, 1393, California Pollution Control Finance Authority. The motion to second was the author will give her commitment to make the amendments, and Appropriations to have the amendments be prepared in the consultation with the committee staff. Roll call.
3531	Vidak	Andy	56	kjbtobUTSlE	348	363	Current estimates suggest there are 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States. A large number of these families have been living in California for years and called this state their home. This resolution is based upon a similar resolution that passed this house last year with unanimous support.
3532	Hancock	Loni	98	gGp8Cmz89Vo	1158	1192	people with physical disabilities, but is not as successful for people with developmental disabilities. We know that people with developmental disabilities can handle complex jobs. We have examples in many counties and institutions of how they do it. We know they deeply appreciate having the work and are excellent employees.
3533	Gatto	Mike	46	uuwAxYppIw8	1065	1081	Terrific. Thank you very much. I was just about to ask for your commitment. Thank you for offering it proactively. And I, the desk just called, we, my, my initial instinct was correct. We can make the amendments in this committee. We have till Tuesday. We're gonna take a deep breath.
3534	Atkins	Toni	110	sA6uJxeRGKk	580	595	California is the top market for ivory with illegal sales of ivory estimated to have doubled over the past eight years. On average, 96 elephants per day are killed for their their ivory translating into an average of over 335, 000 elephants per year.
3535	Hill	Jerry	66	xDQm4xTXlMg	809	821	That remains solid, if that's something that we want to eliminate, then that would be appropriate to me in a natural environment. I guess that's, I don't think we should look for the future in a pathway.
3536	Gaines	Ted	24	9UYl1IR1e0U	1097	1108	There we go. Good afternoon Chair and members. I would like to begin by accepting the committee amendments as author amendments. I bring to you today senate bill 271.
3537	Mitchell	Holly	64	UWn2GFolZOI	628	642	Those who are lined up, we're going to move to public comment. Is it the entire perimeter of the room, or? Show of hands who's going to cue up for this testimony? Excellent. I see Mr. London is at the end of the line. I see you.
3538	Lara	Ricardo	107	mork537FlJg	3	35	Committee Room so we can establish a quorum. I'd like to bring the meeting of the Appropriations Committee, to order. Today will be our longest hearing of the year, so fasten your seat belts it's gonna be a mostly smooth flight. We have a large agenda with a total of 202 bills on file, but only have 18 of them are eligible for a do pass motion. The remaining bills are suspense items.
3539	Nielsen	Jim	68	doJlNdYlHmM	273	292	goals and interrelationships of the three levels of higher education in the 1980s. Assemblyman Vasconcellos and I reviewed it and it was updated. And I would only note that this is very consistent with that master plan. And it helped us keep the master plan intact and not get drifting off.
3540	Roth	Richard	106	LZmU6GkVIb4	1288	1310	Funnel probably is a bad word in state government, but move money from the practice groups to the medical school, which is used in part to fund medical school operations. The same may be true, I do not know about the University Hospital system.
3541	Hernandez	Ed	103	sTyVCkfbZk8	676	689	What I'd like to do is I'd like to see if there's any would like to come up and voice any support. Please state your name and position. Support only at this time.
3542	Holden	Chris	78	mNyHP9HDpqk	2178	2198	We're trying to, to make a difference here, and I appreciate the committees recognizing that as well. As I said before, we continue to make ourselves available, to continue to take input, from those who have other positions on this. To be able to strengthen us if we can, moving forward. I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
3543	Wieckowski	Bob	55	scqfU4UsUAo	1816	1836	Oh no it's good, 308 will allow debtors to have a much better shot at becoming self-sufficient, avoiding consuming more bad debt and being forced onto public assistance. I have with me from the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys Mr. Ike Shulman and Norma Hammes and I urge an aye vote.
3544	Hernandez	Ed	103	2vPXZZpEjE4	963	990	Thank you. Senator, I'd like to make a little few comments before we ask and open up for questions. You know, I came and listened to the proposal. I'm very, very sympathetic about the geographics of where the area is with regard to Camp Pendleton, I believe, to the South and how difficult it is to get care there. And then to go down to, on the Highway 5, which we all know traffic's getting worse.
3545	Block	Marty	59	Ig90uId0Xro	345	358	But in addition to your oral statement which can introduce your position on the issue, feel free to give us additional written information either today or tomorrow. If the 90 seconds isn't enough to say everything you need to say. Okay.
3546	Holden	Chris	78	keBQI17Ppm8	1431	1460	where foster youth are certainly impacted but it's a resource question I guess really is the bottom line and there are limited resources to address all of the needs and this is an area where certainly the local controlled funding plan could include funding for AP STEM but it hasn't because there are so many basic fundamental needs of just providing the basic fundamental services.
3547	Thurmond	Tony	4	gW4lj5dmrVY	712	728	We're going to move in to our next discussion. Our panel on our state developmental centers, we have a number of panelists. And after our panelists have presented, it's an honor that my colleague Assemblymember Dodd is here and he's gonna give us a few brief remarks.
3548	Rodriguez	Freddie	69	FGjC95aJgzI	345	363	Good afternoon, Madam Chair and Members. AB 503 would permit hospitals to release patient identifiable medical information to emergency medical service providers such as ambulance companies and the local emergency medical service agency for quality assessment and patient care improvement purposes.
3549	Beall	Jim	92	U-gbn_qz8sg	58	91	And then I notice that, you know, studying the transportation sector that gasoline taxes are being considered in legislatures throughout the country, I mean, including the Congress. How does that affect the supply or demand itself and by itself in terms of, you know, the supply and demand of gasoline?
3550	Leno	Mark	60	YLKuY8cYE0M	1975	1999	Thank you Senator Nielsen for you comments, and I think you and the Department of Finance have more in common in this Civil Service Reform than you have in difference. I think we're both in agreement and in appreciation of what the administration is attempting to do here, and I do make note and underscore Ms. Bosler's comment that this was in the May revision.
3551	Hertzberg	Robert	99	6z8E6Rb3Uio	523	534	Thank you. Any opposition? I appreciate it. Mr. [inaudible] what do you get going on. They set that youth commission together with this guy in the '70s. What-- And no opposition?
3552	Williams	Das	12	Om99VHbxcmc	561	581	I'm glad we've return to the good government questions because, frankly, I was prepared to ask you some important questions about the operation of the PUC. I didn't think we're going to have a half an hour debate on the RPS, but I will not let those go unanswered.
3553	Allen	Benjamin	70	q8mrHQwqZMs	99	116	You must have called each other in advance,  but I did want to just drill down deeper into this sense of have we gotten ... Is there a sense that we've gotten too big and then that detracts from our sense of participation?
3554	McGuire	Mike	93	iWvzcXZipI0	749	761	Thank you so much. I want to echo the thanks of what Senator Leno brought forward of our Chairwoman, in appreciate the continued focus and for you being a champion and, I thank you for bringing us together today.
3555	Lara	Ricardo	107	qrLFVDrXadw	432	450	Given the fact that some of our cities down the southern part of the river are not as sophisticated as the city of L.A., that will have a potential of utilizing this tool more efficiently to gain more money and to really getting to insuring that we look at the entire river.
3556	Stone	Jeff	26	cbnLA63gWNQ	129	151	Thank you again Madame Chair, I agree with Senator Allen's idea of speed undulations. We used them in the city of Temecula successfully. It's a more politically correct term. And they, by the way, they don't stretch all the way across the road. They're in segments. So if you have a stroller, you can maneuver yourself with those and
3557	McGuire	Mike	93	oIK91dkxix0	957	968	Part of the process is above and beyond the control of the state, of working with the local jurisdictions if new development is gonna need to be taken into account, one.
3558	Holden	Chris	78	-OpN4Uo7BxE	524	545	Clearly with 288 open positions and hundreds of thousands of hours in overtime, there was need for permanent civil service employees. AB 1293 prohibits state departments from creating a need for emergency staffing when sufficient work exists to maintain civil service employee positions. I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
3559	Beall	Jim	92	fMvnlUAhyII	826	852	The other one is, what percentage of the inmates have  medical assessments? You can't really divert people unless you know what's wrong with them. And if you don't have the mental health or other kinds of health care assessments, you won't be able to properly figure out what the best place for them is.
3560	Monning	Bill	25	XG9g8L3IwGU	1757	1775	The potential beneficial use of drones in mapping, survey operations, agriculture, where in the operation of the drone, you may have to go across private property but without the intention of doing surveillance.
3561	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	1O51OMdLA-4	657	674	Thank you Mr. Speaker. AB 672 requires CDCR to provide transitional services to wrongly convicted individuals upon their release from prison. Over the last two decades the number of people exonerated in United States has nearly tripled every year. After
3562	Brough	William	111	_YQzP7dcJFI	1007	1020	Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Being raised by my grandmother, Margaret Eleanor Collins Brough whose grandparents immigrated from Ireland in the 1800s, it's a great honor for me to introduce our guest today. With us is Paschal Donohoe, the Irish government minister for Transport Tourism in sport and a member of the Irish Parliament from the district of Dublin, Central.
3563	Pan	Richard	96	wXHA3EWrHe8	460	479	to prevent them from preventable contagions. In addition, infectious outbreaks disrupts education and harms students and staff and school districts when schools have to be closed, students fall ill, or are quarantined at home for weeks to halt the spread of these diseases. Parents demand that their children are safe at school,
3564	Leno	Mark	60	6d5kBV-0MQs	1600	1630	Senator Nielsen, that is indeed a concern. Mr. Brown, so in 2013, after the CPUC did go out and create a number of nonprofits, and we subsequently learn that there was potential conflict of interest in the development of those nonprofits, that the legislature then restricted their ability to do that without legislative prior approval.
3565	Roth	Richard	106	JZLdEqkqLz4	1060	1083	and by written agreement where you have a loan of personnel and services and material quantifiable? That you then document and the redevelopment agency agrees to repay the city for that loan of people, money, and material from those that perhaps aren't documented quite as well, and how do you sort that out?
3566	Maienschein	Brian	84	-Nb5xJu_Rq4	1182	1203	evaluation services may make a recommendation for conservatorship. If an individual is not receiving such intensive treatment or evaluation services from the county. No such recommendation can be made and no LPS conservatorship may be contemplated. This bill would permit a court faced with relevant medical and other evidence to recommend evaluation of
3567	Ting	Philip	30	EtJ6XaeStes	6	24	So, AB 1397 is a companion measure. Really to provide more transparency to the, the commission. We have a commission currently that holds completely closed door meetings with extraordinarily limited public comment and absolutely does not allow any public attendance.
3568	Mitchell	Holly	64	ISFND_-5pCw	1227	1243	I appreciate your response, cause I think it goes back to the issue raised by the other organization. There are policy agreements. And there is expectations around leadership and how you got, and developed a process by which decisions can be made.
3569	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	_0FvACJKmKc	1397	1405	I failed to do it in our last official meeting. I know there will probably be more but I want to thank you personally for the great work you've done.
3570	Bloom	Richard	2	wr_Nl1-RdXY	359	380	I think our goals from those that I've heard from, and I've heard from quite a few people about this issue are the same, and that is fixing the well exemption issue to ensure the safety of our groundwater. With that are there any other comments? Mr. Williams? I'll second that. We'll continue with the discussion.
3571	Moorlach	John	4657	pmfMdqMvBTk	436	453	Thank you, Mr. Chair. That helps me a little bit. I had to learn the hard way that, that Humpty Dumpty was pushed, and so I'm a little concerned about allowing younger kids to start.
3572	Liu	Carol	63	qCvvxF6FLEU	1072	1095	This bill will help schools implement research based approaches to help break the school to prison pipeline and support the schools and staff ensuring positive con, conditions for learning. The practices funded by these grants can serve as models for effective implementation, improved data and demonstration sites that can spread these best practices across California. I have witnesses in support.
3573	Santiago	Miguel	17	UDPqIWouyOQ	2084	2097	But, I think what's missing is what's important in this bill. I think we should clearly take a look at this bill and understand that it's an important step in moving forward the evaluation system and updating current laws.
3574	Bloom	Richard	2	79bMZ-eNloc	538	560	Given that, and that these penalties could be, if they're inappropriately used, devastating to a small business or a resident in a local community, what protections are built into your proposal to prevent abuse by local governments, local agencies?
3575	Monning	Bill	25	MPEe2Ccro74	591	611	Thank you, Madame President. I want to start by thanking my colleaguem joint author the esteemed Senator from Davis, as well as our co-authorm the Assembly Member from Stockton and all of the co-authors and those who have worked with this along this path.
3576	Patterson	Jim	119	7XQvOXYnjlQ	883	908	That's why I asked the question earlier about - that's why I think the off ramps are important because the question has to be what do we do then if we have impediments to utilizing the overproduction because I think those create some uncertainties that I don't think we'd like to see grow.
3577	Monning	Bill	25	I17DTXkdVm0	1987	2010	The grants are expected to increase health access and improve clinical outcomes for vulnerable populations, and as a result, achieve cost savings in our healthcare system. Sponsoring this bill is State Treasurer John Chung and here to answer any questions, we have a representative from the treasurers office. Respectfully ask for your aye vote at the appropriate time. Thanks.
3578	Alejo	Luis	9	gnd2v7Ro_Uo	754	767	That's why there is an openness to this concept from the Governor's office. Because we included multiple measures, multiple hearings, and to create a plan just to create this entity called ACREA, annual reports to the community of how they're meeting the community goals.
3579	Wood	Jim	72	iF8zLPAheNg	1431	1448	have got us all together to a point where we should have been 15 plus years ago. So I urge you to move this forward. This is the third leg of this dual. We need this leg it's really critical for us to have a reasonable structure around medical marijuana here going forward. So
3580	Pavley	Fran	104	_QWOBYYvqfo	1387	1399	So, this is now a national policy that has the attention of the whole automobile sector. So let's champion that investment, because what do you do, not only clean up the air.
3581	Gordon	Richard	117	0hkCdiDRiI0	2019	2031	AB 339 builds on existing California law and federal guidance, to provide basic consumer protections that take the patient out of the middle of the negotiations between health plans and pharmaceutical manufacturers.
3582	Perea	Henry	33	RfCRfIjvcog	905	920	So we believe that there will be a huge secondary market for places like Fresno, the Central Valley, the Riverside, and other places where many of these vehicles will be very soon in reach for these individuals.
3583	Hertzberg	Robert	99	WnmFSvHbO0k	865	878	Well we will, at time, it says, there's a provision in the bill which says that it's a reimbursible mandate in terms of the cost. Certainly this is not something in terms of this ballot, but as the costs incur, of course that's a requirement under the law.
3584	Hancock	Loni	98	KWZIJnQ_cGk	7	44	I'm really very excited about our hearing today because I think we are about setting California on a new course. Recognizing that 96% of the people in our state prisons will be coming back to our communities and that recidivism can be reduced by 47% if their is education for specific inmates because they do better when they get out and if they have some higher education recidivism is actually reduced by about 51%.
3585	Hernandez	Ed	103	Q0YUSKbr_v0	353	364	As Senator Wolk said, it's a passion of his and I commend him and I think he's done an incredible job not only in this issue but as a leader in issues relating to immigrants as a whole.
3586	Mitchell	Holly	64	7zm3gwdT-l0	821	841	I asked him if he thought in 2015, a student fitting his exact profile could or would be admitted to a UC campus today. When I consider the following, I said on the floor the other day that I thought I was born too late. In this instance, I sure am glad I'm not trying to get into UC today.
3587	McCarty	Kevin	22	9NVb2cnRnt4	397	410	So regardless of how this procedure is going with this ACR 45 and to suspense that this issue that you bring up is I think one that we ought all to fully embrace and make it happen. So thank you.
3588	Perea	Henry	33	x_nA6Vz0FIc	1075	1090	So I just worry that if we do the definition now, that we have a whole group of individuals who'll get caught up in this sort of political, bureaucratic thing when they don't have to be. So that's why I think that again, it would be a mistake not to do something on this measure.
3589	Baker	Catharine	74	h-QyikgWJeU	550	562	In short, he was part of making our world safer. He joined the lab in 1980 and held a number of leadership positions there, and he also worked at the Los Alamos national facility as well.
3590	Beall	Jim	92	Q9Mn4k8Lves	1622	1641	I'm very aware of the process for dealing with special ed. It will save money. It will reduce the life long learning cost of people that have dyslexia. A lot of dyslexia as we heard has been diagnosed or found out later.
3591	Baker	Catharine	74	h-QyikgWJeU	529	550	Bret was acting Director of the Lawrence Livermore national laboratory, a facility critical to the national security protection of our country. He had a depth of knowledge about the US nuclear deterrent and weapons systems, and much of his career was dedicated to assessing, and certified, refurbishing and dismantling weapons systems.
3592	Beall	Jim	92	Q9Mn4k8Lves	1604	1622	The other thing I'd like to point out is that early prevention does moderate dyslexia and it saves the taxpayer money by reducing the costs of the special education. I think that's the intent of the bill and so I'd like to stand in favor of the bill.
3593	Chau	Ed	116	ukB39_tnTUw	115	134	formally with experts in a field of elections and also language accessibility and consider their proposals for enhancing language related voter systems and outreach. I have here today joining me Mr. James Schwab who is the Legislative Director for the California Secretary of State.
3594	Hertzberg	Robert	99	UpjsW9YiW28	207	224	doing everything they possibly can in their power to market to that cause or to market to that community, and that's as far as they can go. That, to me, is the probative question, when you're trying to get to the brand. And we're sitting there and we're competing with these other guys. I don't think that we should go to the lowest bar.
3595	Perea	Henry	33	kQ8roglP29M	1025	1042	Rural communities have been asked to comply with many other regulations that have been promulgated throughout, you know, this entire debate on reducing Greenhouse gases and improving air quality, but yet we've been given very few resources to do so.
3596	Perea	Henry	33	cZs_HLTVPT4	1371	1403	Every day we wait for that technology is another day that me, my daughter, my son, my neighbors, our constituents are breathing dirty air. And so, we see this vehicle AB 1176, as well as others as an opportunity to embrace technologies that are here today. That are affordable, that are available, and that will allow us to reduce the amount of GHGs, NOx and other harmful pollutants in the air today as opposed to 10 or 15 years from now or whatever that magic date is, and so with that I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
3597	Allen	Benjamin	70	_4l4q_6Hap0	1785	1796	So, that's one vote in support, one soft no. What I will now do, we'll hold the roll open for the other members to have a chance to vote.
3598	Hadley	David	40	Zu2V1blghnQ	413	436	This was a truly spontaneous event started by a neighbor of the Clinton's and spread via social media and local media. I had the opportunity to meet with Mr. Ron Clinton. His son is in high school band with my daughter, Ellen, and I expressed to him on behalf of the California State Assembly our support for him and his family.
3599	Holden	Chris	78	EQZBghQKoaM	958	988	Not only does this standard have significant acceptance in California contract law outside of franchise agreements, but it has successfully been used to govern franchise relationships in other States since the early 1970s. Equity Modernization. AB-525 also allows franchisees to recover the basic equity investment they have made in their business if the franchisor terminates the relationship with the franchisee.
3600	Roth	Richard	106	msMPqU5kPd8	213	236	And one thing I'm not certain. One issue I'm not certain about. I just wanna ask because I'm sure you all are, is does the Department of Public Health today not have the authority to step in in appropriate cases, if we have communities where the immunization rate is extraordinarily low, to step in and require vaccinations at public high school districts?
3601	Mendoza	Tony	52	aagt3kLsyTc	834	863	I think making these new adjustments to this bill will make it that much stronger, that much better for all workers, and I'm happy to support it, and I'm glad there's a motion on the measure. Go ahead Madam Secretary let's have a roll call. Motion is to measure be referred to Appropriations Committee.
3602	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	rek1UfAle3c	1224	1242	Well, I'll take the, the, the first lead on this. I, I think all our monies are to go to all students, whether in public or private. What's unique about this effort is, you can see funds going directly into the classroom.
3603	Alejo	Luis	9	fNO-vhR1Uas	770	812	And my last comment, which is regarding, the issue that was raised by some of the previous groups that, you know, there's still seems to be a significant other residents are not utilizing the services that are available for drinking water. But also even some of the water that is made available, that it's  only appropriate for use for limited purposes, like flushing toilets another and other uses. But how can we, perhaps, better communicate that to  many residents that are spanish-speaking? How do we better communicate the appropriate uses for water and the water services that are available for them?
3604	Anderson	Joel	57	npLG8Ena6eQ	1848	1902	When I talked to them, they'd say absolutely they should control their own destiny. And I said well if you knew that a witness didn't have to be there, that the drug could be applied nefariously, would you still we supportive? They said absolutely not. When I said if you knew that those drugs were found unfit for prisoners on death row, would you be supportive? They said absolutely not.
3605	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	n81cNAsH1gw	795	810	I, I would hope that even if we cannot agree on the 72 hour hold then when the clock starts ticking, that there are other parts of this modernization proposal that they can embrace because it will ultimately improve the system the quality of care and that helps their bottom line as well.
3606	Garcia	Cristina	112	Hc7WoMlUJqU	852	869	And we try to leave it out there, without that happening and we're not moving forward. As far as the range of salaries, you know, these companies, they talked about themselves. They hire all these consultants to kinda figure out formulas and so forth and they make it so let's make sure that the business is getting the best deal here out of the, out of the employer.
3607	Nielsen	Jim	68	aXebDhCekK4	1271	1283	And then as to that dialogue and then once access is attained, you find something. Is the landowner granted the opportunity to provide remedy before they are fined or sanctioned?
3608	Anderson	Joel	57	npLG8Ena6eQ	1833	1848	You know, I've heard about the polling and I was concerned, you know, in my that district perhaps I was out of line with those folks that I spoke to and I went throughout my district when this was SB 128, and I collected signatures on where people stood on it.
3609	Leno	Mark	60	iVjsAvWHgB0	1639	1658	That there are service providers that are shutting down as we speak. And, that we can't allow ourselves to repeat mistakes of the past. Where we closed down a state system only to realize that we strangled, starved, our community system.
3610	Stone	Mark	20	qBs9W23Am_w	1898	1921	And so I think that, where there is special equipment, capital investment. Where there is a particular expertise at processing one thing or another, you have the ability for the court to say, this is the kind of work that we have been contracting out, we need to contract out, working within the framework of the bill. I think it gives quite a bit of flexibility.
3611	Wood	Jim	72	OACKM5KF8Sk	1052	1074	Please the Chair. Just a follow-up Mr. Achadjian, your comment about rural county, rural areas and dentists and dead so on. It's a very very expensive education and, one of the challenges with the low reimbursement rates is that a lot of population that we used to train our dental students, go through dental schools.
3612	Liu	Carol	63	qCvvxF6FLEU	128	141	This strategy has successfully transformed schools and communities in areas as diverse as Portland, Oregon and Tulsa, Oklahoma. The community school strategy is supported by both the National league of Cities and the National School Boards Association.
3613	Santiago	Miguel	17	IpuJ5glgG_U	1042	1054	This bill will ensure proper allocation of funds for services provided for some of our most vulnerable citizens. I have and will continue to work with state holders to address all their concerns and I respectfully ask for an aye vote.
3614	Gipson	Mike	28	5MdyQUos5ao	1961	1983	I wanna thank the Auditor, you and your staff for doing an impeccable job, for your contribution, not only doing the audit, but also your contributions you played here today, as well as the legislative analysts. I want to thank you very much and also for the Judicial Council and the AOC for coming out and presenting your particular case.
3615	Hill	Jerry	66	N-Bfbq4TmhI	33	44	It would also provide that an accredited outpatient setting, which is regulated by the medical board is required to perform peer review of physicians and surgeons and other medical staff within its facility.
3616	Leno	Mark	60	gB0SqdP0x6o	517	529	Wouldn't that make sense? And wouldn't that be a good first step that anyone, if we tested everyone, and we found that thirty or forty percent of coming in that you are going directly into treatment.
3617	Monning	Bill	25	hnhklV-igrA	241	262	But it's when that personal choice may have an adverse impact on somebody else's child that forces us to try to make the decision that is in the best interest of our broad community. So that's where I land on this, and again, I appreciate everybody's sincerity and obvious commitment to the...that it's in the best interest of their children. So thank you.
3618	Mitchell	Holly	64	2nTGfRwIGSk	287	301	Thank you, it's okay. Thank you very much. This issue we heard in sub three Senator Monning may recall. I think the last two years. It was an action taken in the budget sub Committee that happened annually.
3619	Gaines	Beth	109	4-5ngRp_LtI	1433	1446	This site does not conflict with any CDCR operational or facility plans at either old Folsom Prison, or new Folsom Prison, and would built and operated with private donations.
3620	Lara	Ricardo	107	qTf-RqJKEFo	1051	1069	The RMC was created through statute in 1999 with the mission to preserve open space and provide for low-impact recreation an educational uses, wildlife habitat restoration and protection, and watershed improvements within the boundaries of the conservancy.
3621	McCarty	Kevin	22	ZXZJp00flVo	33	44	I think we had 15 hearings, over 50 hours of hearings, on this education finance subject matter. So, appreciate all the input and looking forward to closing out our actions today.
3622	Rendon	Anthony	120	nkFf3IHgULc	840	855	Thank you Madam Chair you brought up the idea of enforcement folks from the Apartment Association brought up the idea of the problems relating to information dissemination. There are a number of questions that still need to be answered relative to SB 407.
3623	Mitchell	Holly	64	H8qQQkSchzo	1462	1481	Thank you Mr. Chair, a couple quick questions Senator Wiekowski is, is the crooks of the issue your concern, that the organizations are inappropriately counting some activities as community benefit? Or is it a broader concern around the general under reporting of appropriate activities as community benefit?
3624	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	5fJ7Ysn9i88	555	566	Citizenship test etcetera, the list goes on. So, adult education to me, I'm very passionate about it because I've seen it work, I help deliver it and I've seen the success it can deliver.
3625	Salas	Rudy	34	HBHfaes5iio	1776	1789	Thank you, Mr. Chair, committee members. I present before you Assembly Bill 1043 would not add costs to the state. It would simply make interregional route 43 eligible to compete for interregional transportation improvement program funds.
3626	Linder	Eric	39	9CBpVwqHDr0	582	610	I have to congratulate you for bringing forward another simple, yet elegant measure that seems very, very common sense. I'm glad to support this and I look forward to continuing to partner with you on stopping this plague of hit-and-run accidents that are happening all over the state, and as the assembly member said, in all of our districts. So, thank you for doing this, and you, of course, will count on my support.
3627	Hueso	Ben	48	w3XqiN30Dys	1995	2016	But we haven't really found a way to crack the code on how to build parks in those underserved areas. It's easy for new communities where you add the cost of the amenities into the developer impact fees. And that's how we develop California communities. But for those communities, they've been left behind. So this bill is an equalizer.
3628	Roth	Richard	106	CdKj6oLMa4k	1009	1027	No, no, no. I understand, but that's a different issue. That's a preemption issue, but, you're saying that if you can't have a different set of benefits applied equally across the board to all of your California employees, then you do for your employees based in New York?
3629	Hueso	Ben	48	CVYbaFO-ROE	1044	1073	It might not be the best model, but there's a reason for that. That's to regulate how transportation could better be, and most affordably be provided. We decided here in this state to give an exemption to this industry, so they can operate outside of that regulation from the local level, which creates a disruption in their ability to manage local transportation, because now these services can freely go anywhere in the state.
3630	Pavley	Fran	104	gZ0_qo7XpYk	2536	2554	You don't have an understanding of how because your objective is good. I respect the energy commission. But just the political realities of this challenge, they shall be able to work with you to see, you may have to change the bill to some extent but whatever.
3631	Wagner	Donald	88	-OpN4Uo7BxE	1047	1065	You still have a remedy, you still have to enforce all of the protections as before. All we're doing here is adding a costly, additional, wholly unnecessary mandate that really takes away local control and the abilities of our locals to run elections.
3632	Bonta	Rob	85	d6E9NdP26E4	371	385	Thank you. Additional witnesses in opposition? Seeing none, any questions or comments from members? Can entertain a motion? We have a motion, we have a second. Dr. Pan, would you like to close?
3633	McGuire	Mike	93	iJc5cTYtc4Q	463	480	And what the state did in the recession was take all of the aviation excise taxes that were supposed to be going back to locals for runway improvements, terminal improvements, you name it, hangar improvements. And putting it into the general fund.
3634	Pan	Richard	96	NAcngTShkgg	621	632	So if you're gonna have a broad based provider, they all can get a piece of the Medi-Cal market. Obviously, we wanna be sure there's sufficient oversight as well. But is that something DHS is looking at?
3635	Bloom	Richard	2	-bJq_JGSuxY	1049	1082	Well we saw those as suggestions for further work on the bill. There were two, Mr. Chair, one relating to cost effectiveness. And we wanted to make sure that there's an off ramp that is in the bill and we thought that that addressed that issue. And then underscoring the importance of demand response. I think our witnesses
3636	Waldron	Marie	29	ZTmIOC6QJLc	1471	1488	But one of the things that I noted is what makes mandatory vaccination such a hot topic is that unlike other medical issues where a sick or injured person is treated, with vaccines, we're basically taking a healthy individual and then treating them medically in the absence of an illness.
3637	Rendon	Anthony	120	OGSzGIXfLs8	130	147	AB 825 requires the PUC to use its fee structure to pay for much of the transparency in this bill. Including the costs for the public adviser to help the public navigate the PUC labyrinth. And the costs of an outside auditor or inspector general.
3638	Gipson	Mike	28	rNW_uEjgPtM	970	986	That we can have a conversation with the governor and come to a meeting of the minds where we can address this issue. And he can sign this particular bill into law. We live in a day and age right now that our public, our constituency, demands transparency as well as accountability.
3639	Hancock	Loni	98	Uqg2olh0M7g	1244	1267	I was just going to say, you've raised the whole issue that we dealt with in a way in the previous discussion with the bill about vaccinations. When is it good to do a blanket policy and when is it good to focus on the pockets of the problem and how does one define what they are. So--
3640	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	IRk3z3ZISoY	1994	2046	Well I agree with you this really will be the strongest equal pay bill in the country. It is, as far as I'm concerned, a framework, it's a template. We start at this point to deal with equality in the workplace. And I look at this as a springboard going forward, and it is my hope and expectation that as we go forward, we will strengthen and expand so that all people are paid equally or for work of comparable value or substantially similar work. This really is going to provide a seat change and we will watch it carefully and it is, I think, the intent of all of us that we ultimately end up in the not too distant future, certainly not taking another 35 or 45 years to get equality in the workplace for everyone.
3641	Pavley	Fran	104	FapiTOGMI3c	39	61	And so mining is part of that jurisdiction, and in fact, many of the provisions of this bill came from the administration who convened a stakeholder process for mining law reforms. I think everyone agrees reforms are needed. 'How much' and 'when' probably is the subject of discussion.
3642	Williams	Das	12	B_DlPPzaBGc	712	733	Can I ask Mr. Hadley one question related to that? Does that mean you would support a 50 percent ban on our organics in the landfill, because if that's something you would support maybe the authors would move in that other, stronger direction. I think we were just trying to make a very pragmatic concession to local governments and industry.
3643	Fuller	Jean	49	q7JaQd-cxG0	528	533	I take it that you support the letter of the law now since the Prop 1 is the law, and you want to make it work. Is that what you're trying to say?
3644	Cooley	Ken	45	ufpnr2TGLO8	1033	1053	And then try to bring that forward, which will entail some advocacy with the federal level, which has its own challenges. But the fact is we are California, and we can generally do more within our own borders, our own structures of government than many other states, just because of the scale things here.
3645	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	HgBIr1hupMw	98	116	So I thank you for the opportunity to present to the committee on its behalf of the caucus, and to present to you the proposal for reinvestment in early care and education. I believe you've gotten our letter dated March 4.
3646	Morrell	Mike	51	d6E9NdP26E4	1013	1033	Studies have shown that women who receive these services have healthier pregnancies, and less complicated births. Under current law, however, licensed midwives are not recognized as eligible providers of these benefits. Which falls squarely within their scope of practice. So SB 407 expands healthcare access to low income mothers.
3647	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	JG7mRMz5Gp8	587	602	Okay, and a couple of other questions. I mean, listen, I have, a lot of times in this committee, we deal with people who want to get the teacher, and I'm just, on my concern is I now we want to get the superintendent. I don't want to get anybody, I want everybody to be successful, so what is dismiss for cause mean?
3648	Frazier	Jim	114	jj5fwuuTvrg	1911	1921	It's a wonderful opportunity for the valley. And so with that, Madame Secretary, we do have a motion from Ms. Kim and Ms. Baker was the second. Call the roll.
3649	Moorlach	John	4657	Ig90uId0Xro	1662	1669	If you're using an ADA formula to kind of make it no better, no worse, what happens to the smaller districts that have really emphasized a good CTE program?
3650	Monning	Bill	25	23IlHVpz85o	1658	1676	Good question. It does not. If they're licensed from another state, that license is recognized in California. If they seek, even if they have out of state driving experience, if they seek a California license, then they would be required to show the minimum training.
3651	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	37JGlYuk31E	522	534	And some people don't like that, and I understand that. And I've tried to be as accessible as possible. I'm a plain talker. I'm going to tell you where I am. I'm sorry if that's offensive to people. But I'm representing my community.
3652	Leno	Mark	60	xL36G7ytN6U	535	559	In interest of time, I will not reiterate the very articulate and powerful case that Senator Hill made yesterday in presentation of his CPUC reform bill and thank you, Senator Hill for that and for all your work in addressing the needs of the CPUC. We know what happened in San Bruno, we know what's happened with back-room communication, since revelations through many email communications.
3653	Leno	Mark	60	xL36G7ytN6U	497	535	Thank you, Madame President and colleagues. I'm very pleased to have been working with the chair of the utilities and energy Committee, Senator Hueso, in bringing you SB 660, a very needed reform to the California Public Utilities Commission. It will reform their regulatory process that's resulted in serious failure to protect public safety and rate payer interests.
3654	Roth	Richard	106	TPx_LL6qRDw	1065	1087	services our system is going to be even more impacted. So to the extent that USDVA has capacity, that will be great. But to the extent USDVA doesn't, we're gonna have to figure out a way, in the State of California, to deliver these services to folks. That not only are entitled to them, but we've promised them.
3655	Gallagher	James	108	24W2oeMkjbI	1409	1421	So, you know, by passing this legislation, we're not necessarily incurring, all the courts are not incurring this cost. It's only if the county and the court agree to do so. Is that correct?
3656	Chau	Ed	116	gT2_z9UGrSs	456	469	On the one hand, we need to provide more resources and training for teachers to teach computer science. And on the other hand we want to improve, the, participation and success of the underrepresented populations in the field. Thank you.
3657	Allen	Benjamin	70	MwU2rlmXSqg	631	647	It, it does seem a very interesting situation that we're spending so much of our budget on, on a, you know, a relatively small portion of our veteran population is, the most acute needs veterans, or what is it?
3658	Eggman	Susan Talamantes	73	TPSat3Z_tD4	1342	1355	AB830 just seeks to clarify this discrepancy by conforming the definition of gender with Unruh civil rights act. We have a broad coalition of supporters including AFSME, Quality California, California Woman Law Center, and national association of social workers there is
3659	Block	Marty	59	EWFYx7q92DQ	1764	1787	What will happen with these small changes is the fees the pawn brokers can charge, will go from the 48th in the state. So the second lowest in the country rather, to the 47th, so the third lowest in the country. Still very very low fees but enough we think to again allow California's fine pawn broker industry to stay in business.
3660	Bloom	Richard	2	C5FKcnZ9gio	35	51	The tax would only go into effect if a two-thirds majority of the voters approved, of course. Smoking continues to be the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, and at least 30% of cancer deaths and 87% of all lung cancer deaths are caused by smoking.
3661	Levine	Marc	8	B5S6WSG3Bcc	322	346	The second one, and something for all of California, but particularly for people that we saw in some of the photos, Stockon, for example. You talked about the lack of enrollment in flood insurance and how this occurs during drought and yet, history informs us that flood follows drought.  And I think that's something for us to really consider. How do we start raising this as an issue?
3662	Cooper	Jim	21	gmSplS1IxCE	1023	1030	You have kids eating edibles in classes, and the bottom line, even though you're supposed to be 21 to have alcohol and buy it, kids still have access to it.
3663	Hernandez	Roger	37	MO4QFekCxFk	1525	1545	I communicated that yesterday that I needed to have binding language. So, I, I'm concerned about the regressive taxation issue. And concerned about, again, if we're gonna create billions of dollars in new monies, I need to be guaranteed that the cities that I share with Senator Hernandez, and
3664	Leno	Mark	60	SCWpb6PxRGE	1197	1213	And so, that's the fine balance here. I know you're trying to address it. And I appreciate your efforts. I also appreciate all the comments made today, because I know that they are real and heart felt. We're trying to find that, that delicate balance here. Thank you.
3665	Cooley	Ken	45	7bdBeI04iMY	1044	1076	I think it is right to side. With the angels. Abraham Lincoln and his second inaugural address in January. A month before he died could speak of the fact that when he looked at this nation and this threat that it would come apart fly apart in that great war he said we can he could see chords that connected every he said patriots grave and, battle field.
3666	Gipson	Mike	28	CRMwg6_WO3E	72	115	Because each person who transitioned back into their home. is one less person that the state has to pay for because of the high-cost of staying in a nursing home. By increasing the allowance, no one will be provided- excuse me. By increasing the allowance not only will we provide people and to improve the quality of life and allow them the joy of staying in their own home we will certainly ask that my colleague support an aye vote.
3667	Cooley	Ken	45	7bdBeI04iMY	982	998	In his hands rest on sort of this these bundle sticks. You conjure up that image of Abraham Lincoln and the Lincoln memorial his hands rest there one a clenched fist one  an open hand both rested on a bundle sticks bound together that is the one symbol as I've said before that
3668	Alejo	Luis	9	5E8YMvh3dfU	389	402	In closing Mr. Chairman, I serve as the chair of the Latino Caucus and proud to stand in solidarity with the API Caucus in supporting this important proposal. I respectfully ask for your support when this comes back to your vote.
3669	Nielsen	Jim	68	fPXDsUW3HWg	156	169	Miss Bosler, do all of the provisions of this proposed legislation extinguish upon the extinguishing of the Governor's emergency declaration? All of the provisions they end, some of them do I understand, but do all of them?
3670	Irwin	Jacqui	16	doJlNdYlHmM	178	201	For that reason, we have a broad coalition of business labor, social justice faculty and student groups are committed to pursuing this reforms to basic skills education. This bill provides guidance to the Chancellor's office and will require colleges that are applying to provide a plan of action. AB 770 will ensure that this money is targeted effectively.
3671	Moorlach	John	4657	EK6oKbTFoPo	646	672	Mr. Sisney, Chair and I serve on governance and finance and we had a deep discussion yesterday of all these bills that are coming through, and a lot of them are offering tax credits. It seems like that's a fashionable thing to do of late. One including low-income housing tax credits of potentially $300 million per year.
3672	Grove	Shannon	77	uSmu0VlTZFk	111	122	But I do wanna highlight some of the stuff that has happened, because it is a shameful part of our history that we as legislators in the state must address. Both Sonoma and Fairview have been wracked with abuse and deficiency in care.
3673	Nazarian	Adrin	36	qMylnhtxSF8	1609	1636	Then the parent is left with a choice of going to either another doctor, or, if maybe that is not available given region, regional constraints or various other issues, they will need to oblige. What if the second child also has an adverse reaction? What happens at that time?
3674	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	UpjsW9YiW28	1945	1956	So this bill would kind of connect, as I understand it, sort of hand and glove with Senator Hueso's measure so that there would be the requirement, the maintenance training, and notice.
3675	Block	Marty	59	r722a4Ml8Ec	1203	1219	I'm prepared to make a motion on this, but first I just want to state a position that I've stated in subcommittee. I have concerns about the state investing more money in more lawyers. As an attorney I know there are at least a couple more attorneys on this panel.
3676	Brown	Cheryl	13	xGJu-g3aL7c	1167	1179	But he said, hey, let's figure out a way to pay them. So that to me is a good leader and I thank you for allowing to be apart of this hearing today.
3677	Allen	Benjamin	70	iTrvWXqiedk	2290	2306	I'd love to talk to you about that. You know, one question I had for you also is do you agree with the data that's been presented by the supporters that suggest that 25,000 tickets are given out every year at seven stop signs?
3678	Chiu	David	7	B4ry1_3tU0U	840	855	And we have to ensure a bright line set of distinctions. And I think on the, it actually undermines the ability of those immigration attorneys that are doing the right thing. So I'm happy to support this bill, and I would also be happy to be added as a co-author.
3679	Anderson	Joel	57	E_gAhll2czw	590	626	He and his family survived the depression and moved to Oklahoma City where he graduated from high school. After graduating from the naval academy in 1949, Dale served our country for 31 years and was a veteran of World War 2, the Korean war, and the Vietnam War. In 1950 he married his wife of 50 years, Irene Riley Helmer, and started their married life in New Orleans, Louisiana.
3680	Garcia	Eduardo	38	WE6m9wVcbNQ	852	872	Assembly Member Cooper alluded to the industry, by no means. I believe the intention of this bill is to eradicate the business aspect of e-cigarettes and vaping. People will still have the ability to purchase these, just simply under a different criteria and umbrella in order for the purposes of regulation and so, I've not heard anyone.
3681	Eggman	Susan Talamantes	73	xdTTK0YoutY	1020	1051	So this is not just Filipino history, members, this is California history, this is American history and it's only right that we should remember this great leader for who too long we have forgotten about. So I strongly urge the support for AB 7 as we remember and honor Larry Itilong and the work that was done in the central valley, in the State of California, to really what move workers' rights forward in a way that was not able to ever be turned back.
3682	Cannella	Anthony	61	5WD5y8t5m5U	879	897	But when we have a district attorney that's inserted themselves into a process to look into something,potentially criminal, potentially not, you know, the first audit, the letter that you provided, Assemblywoman, I think it says the first audit request was in January of 2013. So, that was over 2 years ago.
3683	Block	Marty	59	cXnV6IOLWSg	563	579	The bill also provides grants to community service organizations that help students complete the federal loan forgiveness process. These grants will insure that students have the legal expertise and support necessary to access the federal loan forgiveness that they're entitled to.
3684	Fuller	Jean	49	XFSLCFM97Og	1201	1218	So maybe 36 percent-- let's say it was double. That's probably high, but let's say it was. Then those parents are receiving some combination of TANF for Aid to Families during that time, because they're not receiving their support check.
3685	De Leon	Kevin	102	8E9La7s73fc	538	565	We have much to go still. But that's why the role that you play at the Cal ISO is very critical. Especially when we're speaking about something that's very delicate with regards to regionalization and how we integrate this, if in fact and it's a big gift, if in fact for both sides if the numbers work out and if it works out ultimately for the rate pair for the consumer of California. And quite frankly, our children's lives at the end of the day.
3686	Wieckowski	Bob	55	r0_c68VZXFY	1242	1262	The total amount of the debt that they owe does not go away, it just pays it back at its lower rate. With the amendments that I'm prepared to accept today I work diligently with advocates understanding concerns that have been voiced. I think the bill is even better at focusing on the workers who are struggling to get by.
3687	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	emhy9UKtKg0	249	285	a way to address the concerns that were expressed by the committee. And yet deal with the legitimate questions about how we can allow for victims to be able to redress those grievances, in dealing with the forum shopping question. And the agreement is that if we will pass this bill out of committee today, Senator Leno will move for reconsideration.
3688	Bloom	Richard	2	bgIZ8epTm-I	243	272	However, energy conservation, much like water conservation, is also arguably our most overlooked resource. Unlike renewable energy, there is no tangible bar set for achievement, and unlike conventional power, the default position is not that we will purchase it at any price. And as a result, energy efficiency, which is largely on the demand side of the meter, has not been meaningfully factored into the state's long-term energy planning process.
3689	McGuire	Mike	93	sy4t4DpLFas	364	376	But here is the contradiction. We allow for new offshore oil drilling via the 94 Sanctuary Act, while passing the Marine Life Protection Act, whose whole goal is to protect the sensitive coastal areas and marine life.
3690	McGuire	Mike	93	sy4t4DpLFas	344	364	So in 1994 we had the Sanctuary Act, in 99 we passed the Marine Life Protection Act. This act is designed to protect or conserve marine life and habitat. The goal of the act is to designate a region as a marine protected area, and "increase effectiveness at protecting the state's marine life, habitat and ecosystems."
3691	Hertzberg	Robert	99	4MjmF7EnXtg	1567	1575	There's a number of other areas where we expedite proceeding, where we balance public interests. We do it in all sorts of areas of the law. Domestic violence cases.
3692	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	Rt-g3tEX78Q	866	897	You're well aware the research has shown that children who are motivated and spend more time reading do better in school and ultimately career. Please join me in welcoming Toby and recognizing the role that he another California teachers have in getting our students excited about reading. If you can read, thank a teacher. Thank you, Toby.
3693	Patterson	Jim	119	X-EMNVy0KVE	1583	1597	Frankly if this were my children I would be less worried about the fact that they can crush up some pills as if they are crushing up some pills they will find some other way to get the high.
3694	Stone	Jeff	26	perI44B8dbA	1100	1113	I'm specifically aware of one in particular in which a public entity has done so. In terms of posting a publication. And so, this would provide an opportunity to ensure that we don't have this continue moving forward in the future.
3695	Cannella	Anthony	61	LVzFkfmZq9U	563	577	So, the minimum fine is five times higher than what we currently have for personal protection for privacy, and it really could be much more than that, so, are you... I could be supportive of this bill if you would match what we currently have in law.
3696	De Leon	Kevin	102	qSESWnQqhic	694	711	Thank you, Madam President and colleagues. We have an apartment before, that's Mr Santi J. Rogers governor's appointment for director Department of Developmental Services. Miss Rogers was hurt in Rules Committee under February fourth and was approved on a bipartisan vote of 5 to 0, there was no opposition. Mr. Rogers is in his 47th year of service to the state and the developing disabled community here in California.
3697	Wagner	Donald	88	GYqLytCM9KA	1074	1128	The fact that the fed aren't paying attention or don't care enough to fix the disconnect is not a reason to now change the procedure to be as follows. You don't have to plead guilty, you get into the diversion program, hopefully you succeed in that diversion program, but if you don't, a year or two, however much time longer it's taken you to fail out of the drug diversion program, then you're criminal case begins again. But we all know about how "justice delayed is justice denied". We all know how about how extending statute of limitations makes it harder and harder for cases to be proved, either the prosecution to successfully prove their case or the defense to successfully prove their case. Either way delay doesn't help anybody in the criminal justice system.
3698	Williams	Das	12	jAVMxyN_c9U	444	460	However, I think to answer your question fully, the debate has moved on about the question of the mandate and more about the question of what is included. My colleague from Santee is right that most of the debate at this point is about what is included in that 50%.
3699	Bonta	Rob	85	doJlNdYlHmM	1026	1038	So there is a commitment to that discussion, just not an agreement on what that looks like. And I agree with respect to sustainability and how it could siphon away revenue that could go elsewhere. And that's a discussion we need to continue to have.
3700	Quirk	Bill	23	dJ6Is8ZeyoY	1248	1262	And I would agree, you've made some very good points, and certainly we had a bill earlier this year, which has become a two year bill, because we wanted to see the PUC process go forward.
3701	Gallagher	James	108	7KrRcZ9ORsY	836	853	All the other clinics have government founding and so we're saying to that minority that's completely privately-funded, you need to tell about the majority of clinics who receive government founding and have a whole lot more advantages in terms of their funding than the privates do.
3702	Patterson	Jim	119	vYqU_TjNJ4I	411	435	California currently imposes multiple taxes and fees on all the business formation in the state, and it includes a, a minimum franchise tax of $800 per year, whether or not the business actually makes a profit. So for small businesses just getting on their feet, these taxes and fees can represent a very serious financial hardship in the early years.
3703	Morrell	Mike	51	aimc434xzo4	763	775	SB 407 expands healthcare access to low-income mothers and gives them a choice. Expectant mothers of all income levels should have options when it comes to deciding where and how they bring their children into this world.
3704	Frazier	Jim	114	fSCMT0VJDKw	361	377	One of the key safety elements of the GDL is that minors with a provisional licence are prohibited from driving between the hours of 11pm and 5AM, or from transporting passengers who are under 28 years of age.
3705	Gallagher	James	108	7KrRcZ9ORsY	803	822	They could do a city-wide campaign, letting people know about low cost government programs that provide prenatal care and other heath care for women. So you know, I think that case is pretty on point.
3706	Levine	Marc	8	_nP8ehQPzkI	432	455	AB 987 clarifies current law by explicitly prohibiting an employer from retaliating against a worker for requesting a reasonable disability or religious accommodation regardless of whether the accommodation request was granted. The bill has no opposition. Here to testify in support of the bill is Menaka Fernando from the California Employment Lawyers Association and Allen Reinach from the Church State Council.
3707	Wieckowski	Bob	55	QJc2lBXiJmk	125	147	That we're continuing to inject into potential drinking water sources. Now, today's hearing is the first of an opportunity for the administration to explain how we arrived here, and what is being done to correct the situation and ensure this type of mistake does not occur again.
3708	Mitchell	Holly	64	elxm9FjpDgY	912	935	Great. Can I roll back to Cal-Learn? We've heard that primarily, anecdotally I will acknowledge, but that the Cal-Learn case load may be impacted by the fact that all pregnant and parenting teens aren't being referred to Cal-Learn and they're simply being nested if you will in CalWorks, in CalWorks families.
3709	Calderon	Ian Charles	115	llrxaJMn6L0	618	633	But what we don't want to do is we don't want to handicap ourselves. We don't want to handcuff ourselves to a point where, you know, in this discussion I think it's easy to put ourselves in a position where we kind of end up with a bill that doesn't really do anything other than just allow the current standards to move forward.
3710	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	RK37B-MMwt0	1286	1309	The bureau's paramount mandate is consumer protection and without taking away their ability to adequately perform these actions would put the bureau in direct conflict with this mandate. To avoid this conflict we need the bureau -- To give the bureau ability to enact future -- Or respond, rather, to future financial needs by raising the minimum fee ceiling.
3711	Mullin	Kevin	31	9mjyTPfbhPw	615	644	Mr. Jones is objecting to the immediate ruling by the Chair with regard to Mr. Holden's point of order. If Mr. Jones is appealing the decision of the chair, Mr. Jones, you have two minutes to present. Second.  Actually that requires a second, however, on the appeal. That is seconded by Mr. Wilk. Mr. Jones, two minutes.
3712	Pan	Richard	96	m65WWf8IMs4	11	30	So there, the Department of Public Health and other experts have, depending on the disease and the vaccination. So for example, measles, you need about approximately 92 to 95% immunization rates to basically contain an outbreak. That's what they're looking at.
3713	Block	Marty	59	Q1vYBQdDLNc	539	553	In the past two years, I've worked with Cindy on several issues. She brings a wealth of knowledge and enthusiasm to the district. Most importantly, Cindy cares about the kids, and she knows what makes kids successful in the classroom.
3714	Bonilla	Susan	3	y0NCxRtyQHE	0	12	And then you wouldn't have to look at them. I mean, you'd have to evaluate them but you have a standard in place that would make it very clear that they shouldn't, in their broader of courses be adding in things like the example we have in our report.
3715	Monning	Bill	25	CVBfShlBh9U	292	305	Yeah, yeah. Yeah and it is available information. It doesn't put a requirement on anybody to go seeking before they make a determination. Thank you and appreciate your bringing the bill. I'm glad to move it at the appropriate time.
3716	Levine	Marc	8	AJJV4Jngl_c	150	163	Before we proceed further, are there any other members who would like to make some brief opening comments or remarks? All right, thank you. Here's how I would like to conduct today's hearing.
3717	McGuire	Mike	93	J0kwSkFFMEE	967	989	According to the LAO's own report, partnership academies, which target the most disadvantaged youth in school districts, including foster youth, is the number one program on the chopping block when it comes to local school districts and their budget, with apprenticeship academies as number four.
3718	Leno	Mark	60	Q3p12T-SoaE	264	293	Tax-aid, I know we do that in San Francisco. Accountants volunteer their weekend time and we put out word on bus shelters and through other means of communication to let people know that if they think they might qualify, they should stop by a school or community college and have an account and look at their information and see if they might be owed money, and sometimes people walk away stunned, 2-3-4-5000 dollars.
3719	Dodd	Bill	71	tae4cv2hHsk	341	356	In 20 seconds over $358 million in damage was done to private homes and public infrastructure. On September 11th, President Obama declared the earthquake a major federal disaster, freeing up federal and state relief dollars.
3720	Bonilla	Susan	3	iZciv2kSkT8	1184	1195	Right, because I could see with that language you could potentially, the original, the first contract itself could be a ten-year contract, cuz it could be anything not less than five years. It could be a twenty-year contract, so hopefully that's not the case.
3721	Nazarian	Adrin	36	KzIfF7fCyGE	28	47	network companies to, one, be enrolled in the DMV Employer Pull Notice Program, and two, to participate in a drug and alcohol testing program. Additionally, a third provision AB 24 requires is for TNCs to register any vehicle used under its platform with a PUC--
3722	Huff	Bob	105	-v1uD0LX8sQ	354	383	So you add that all up, they're saying within 15 years, we have 75% higher electricity because of our energy policies, which drives the primary part of that. There are some new thoughts that are coming down the pike about and, they call it energy poverty, because as we have higher cost of electricity we have over a million over of our households that are spending 10% of their budget on electricity
3723	Allen	Benjamin	70	gGO-NA0OnUA	501	518	Folks on the committee who know much about this issue know that there was a lot of mercury that got into the rivers during the gold rush in the nineteenth century, and so this is, we're still feeling the impact of this as a result of particular activities that happened in the rivers.
3724	Nguyen	Janet	65	gDPCmEU7pmg	680	702	What is affected areas membership needs? You know because I think it would help local government because you know, at the end of the day, there are very large cities that has a lot of manpower, staff, lawyers and everybody to interpret different ways and you have smaller cities.
3725	Quirk	Bill	23	DgVvXUz7n-U	1474	1506	We wanna give them an option. So my sister made the decision to do everything that needed to be done to live another year. My mom had Alzheimer's. She couldn't make a decision for herself. However, with Alzheimer's, and as old as she was in having had strokes and heart attacks, we knew she didn't have a long time. But for many years, those years were healthy for her. She went along.
3726	Vidak	Andy	56	5WD5y8t5m5U	1342	1352	Mr. Chair and Members, thank you. I respectfully request that the Joint Legislative Audit Committee approve an audit to fully examine the California High Speed Rails Authority use of flash appraisals.
3727	Weber	Shirley	44	_ES7C4KFvkc	639	648	And does that quality identification have to exist before the money is allocated? So that you don't just get money and then all of a sudden you discover the program was not of quality.
3728	Gomez	Jimmy	80	22lWaj2Ih1o	1164	1179	Great. I would ask you to close but we have a motion and a second this bill is out. Oh, opposition. Sorry, I was a little excited. Individuals from the public in opposition? Department of Finance?
3729	Weber	Shirley	44	_ES7C4KFvkc	630	639	And too often we say that without all the other administrative pieces in place. And thinking about, okay well then, if it has to be of quality, who's going to evaluate the quality?
3730	Mitchell	Holly	64	vEySB-JPx9Q	2077	2092	And, those who can't afford to get the academic training and experience that we want all of those in the early care and education field to have to provide the best possible experience for our children.
3731	Vidak	Andy	56	0yf1SfBcDOs	2156	2169	People are number one, the constituents that we represent are number one, it's people. I look at this project being on the ground floor, being right there. I mean my friends in labor, I want to put them all to work.
3732	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	rW1B4Jx9iIw	1489	1509	and I would also add, you have two members of public safety budget, public safety number five, you have Mr. Lackey here and myself here, so think of us as Santa Claus, and we might be able to provide you all the staffing and money that you need.
3733	Hill	Jerry	66	L9_yK97Q24w	121	136	But the increased use of this technology has raised concerns over civil liberties and privacy. Current law addresses license plate readers used by the CHP and transportation agencies, but it ignores local law enforcement and private use, uses.
3734	Leyva	Connie	62	2w72Z1tf27E	984	1024	I know that we all like email and we all like texting, but there's nothing like being able to drop a card or a piece of mail into our mailboxes and expect that it will be delivered to the recipient within a few days. SJR 11 is supported by the National Association of Letter Carriers, National Association of Postal Supervisors, the California Labor Federation, California American Postal Workers Union, and the California Rural Letter Carriers Association. Here to speak in support today is John Beaumont with the National Association of Letter Carriers, and Larry DeNayer with the American Postal Workers' Union. And I respectfully request an aye vote.
3735	Hill	Jerry	66	07ilphfHuEw	1774	1789	Thank you Madame President and members. I rise to request concurrence in Assembly amendments to SB 48 which adopts several reforms to the Public Utilities Commission. Assembly amendments add requirements for the PUC to conduct outreach and make other technical changes. I respectfully request concurrence on the Assembly amendments.
3736	Bonta	Rob	85	q7LT4HnI37Y	22	44	are still that it'll take about four years to clear the current pending investigation workload. And so I guess my question is, it seems like a a significant amount of resources that are being provided, but four years seems like too long. What do you need to do something in a Shorter time frame than four years?
3737	Thurmond	Tony	4	A6ledtIW6-Y	602	625	With that, I wanna call the first group of presenters to provide us with an overview. We wanna welcome Dwayne LaFon from the Department of Developmental Centers Division. John Doyle, the Deputy Director of the Department of Developmental Services. Santi Rogers and representatives from Finance and the LAOs office. When you're ready. Thank you.
3738	Dababneh	Matthew	50	wtimHXTHmS8	460	472	I will tell you it's just important to remember that this is really not a new bill. This is extending the new protections built in to 785 last year design-build.
3739	Mitchell	Holly	64	Ea-UVDMoM1k	864	884	what happens if no agreement is comes up with? Where does that leave us in that we will have missed the window of the current budget season in framework, where we are talking about major major investments in core infrastructure and health and developmental services.
3740	Pan	Richard	96	51wXJ30ZLf4	1116	1123	Even though we know that we have this problem, we end up getting back to the place where we have to start all over on this step because it's not like they're on this all the time.
3741	Thurmond	Tony	4	adewtR6e1X4	1218	1243	Let's do this. I'm gonna help you with your point. I'm gonna ask Mr. Rogers to provide us, not today, but information about the transition plan. And part of that transition means what happens afterwards. This is clearly a very important issue. I think it could be a conversation in and of itself. We need more information, and we need it soon. How much time do you need, Mr. Rogers, so I can satisfy Miss Grove?
3742	Leno	Mark	60	EvXJx3b_7-s	1686	1700	Yeah, so, clearly a huge need, and this will begin to address that. So we have a motion from Assemblywoman Weber for this CSU funding package. Do we have any questions? Senator Neilson.
3743	Patterson	Jim	119	2mUHw1EX7J4	1124	1144	And with all due respect to the Senate, I am not elected to the Senate, I've been elected to the Assembly and I think other members should have been in these various committees. We know that's something we need to ask about our Rules Committee and the decisions that they've made.
3744	Nielsen	Jim	68	N5YEVBe8-2M	949	969	So, its just an overview and then the answer is not simply more money in this case, more fines and more penalties that were unnecessary, fines and penalties directed just to make more money for the agency, not to straighten up bad actors.  So, looking forward to the oversight hearing.  Thank you.
3745	Wieckowski	Bob	55	QkQlxH8U7IE	661	687	Mr. Conaty, I think you misconstrue what this proposed constitutional amendment does. It does not go after the American flag, it goes after all the flags. And with that, Senator, can you respond to comment number 2 about the contact neutral and viewpoint neutral aspects of the students' action?
3746	Mullin	Kevin	31	5Qw_YsDfvQ4	2097	2113	That's Greg Evan's reception in the conference room. There will also be a reception for Norooz in room 317 from 12:30 to 3PM. On behalf of the Irish members, souvenirs will be delivered to your offices tomorrow in honor of Saint Patrick's day. The candy is from a local gourmet jelly bean company in my home town of south San Francisco.
3747	Monning	Bill	25	npLG8Ena6eQ	2176	2207	This has been practiced in a manner that has been embraced by members of the medical community, not all. This legislation prompted a very robust discussion among members of the California Medical Association who made their own historic choice to move from opposition to neutrality because they recognized that the hippocratic oath has also involved.
3748	Hadley	David	40	ohOGzwAGjR4	1105	1121	If I can just make one further comment. There are, there are absolutely reasons why we, why we, as a state, did this in AB32 and, and elsewhere, and why we're considering this now, but expensive electricity is not a jobs program.
3749	Nielsen	Jim	68	5xjBSsaNwEY	663	679	Senator Rodriguez or maybe one of the witnesses can differentiate the amendment here. It substitutes a solicitor for agent broker. What's the distinction? What would be a solicitor as opposed to a broker agent?
3750	Leno	Mark	60	07ilphfHuEw	1288	1303	So I'm glad that all of you are on that Budget Committee and thank you for your comments tonight. We have more in common than we have in difference. Senator Nielsen's ongoing concern with the gaming of unfilled positions, I'm right there with him, and I know the Governor is as well
3751	Medina	Jose	81	_x7-b1Y1JBM	1150	1177	Madam Chair and members, AB 721 provides students with the necessary information to make informed decisions about college attendance costs and student lending options. Most college students face substantial student loans upon graduation. And many of these are private loans, which are typically more costly and provide fewer protections compared to federal loans.
3752	Leno	Mark	60	EvXJx3b_7-s	946	965	And I'm not insensitive to arguments that I hear from UC, that we're all aware of. That they have very limited opportunities for raising additional funds to make up for that now 5% differential that we have caused in the past thirty-five years.
3753	Irwin	Jacqui	16	d4pMcLnXU0U	824	844	AB 171 will provide a steady stream of funding, which is critical because it will provide the retention of CVSO staff who have developed the expertise and relationships that help leverage federal dollars. I have Pete Conaty with me from the California Association of County Veteran Service Officers to describe the impact that this funding will have.
3754	Maienschein	Brian	84	xhI7BgS1JK0	2040	2049	Section two still is something that we would work on and you know what, to the extent we could work out section three, I'm willing to do, you know, I'm willing to work, continue to work with them as well on that.
3755	Stone	Jeff	26	NOpjVjVZw80	1026	1037	That's why I've been a strong supporter of NAME, National Association of Mental Illness, to reduce the stigma and to bring the parity that you're advocating for and I appreciate your answers, thank you.
3756	Bloom	Richard	2	xD8oreL8upA	725	747	But the bill in front of you today, represents substantial progress. And in fact, the core of a new structure and process is in place, but there's more work to be done. I'll let some of our sponsors provide the details, but the essence of the concept is, is this, state weight limits for transit buses must be recalibrated to acknowledge
3757	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	gZ0_qo7XpYk	2086	2112	So, we're going to find more peaker or we're actually changing this definition or asking the CEC and the PUC to change this definition to address the realities of a more renewable portfolio of energy production. And what we've had in the past is standards that don't reflect the ability through technology to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
3758	Hill	Jerry	66	843OfhKnV14	65	82	SB 541 helps to fix storage problems by establishing new program priorities such as improved customer service and enforcement. The bill requires the branch to report to the legislature on its ability to meet the new goals and to identify what changes might be needed in order for them to do so.
3759	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	j_gGP70jLkM	991	1023	Heart disease is still the number one killer of women. Each year 1 in 3 women die of heart disease and stroke. It is more deadly than all forms of cancer combined. In California an average of a hundred women per day die from heart disease and stroke. Since 1984, more women than men have died from heart disease and the gap between men and women survival continues to widen
3760	Mendoza	Tony	52	5EeaivfMcyY	155	180	Yet, in the case of the Court Reporters Board versus US Legal, the CRB did just that. They sued US Legal for violations of the CRB's gift-giving standards. US Legal was one of the opponents here today, could have opted to pay the fine, the $2,500 fine and stop the unethical practice of gift-giving.
3761	Allen	Travis	43	KcpO7Oo2ci0	187	203	My bill, AB 1425 would provide small businesses throughout California just a little bit of parity with big businesses in the health insurance market which will give them the ability to provide quality health insurance to their employees at the best cost possible.
3762	Hertzberg	Robert	99	MbrLwdg2wyw	396	411	It is not acceptable in a democracy when we travel the world and you look at this place, and you've got these turnouts. It's just embarrassing. We have this duplicity on the one hand and we talk about this great democracy and this patriotism for democracy, and it's really not.
3763	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	ok4qN3L6USs	1945	1956	Thank you. Any further opposition to the bill?  Seeing none, any comments from members of the committee? Seeing no comments from members of the committee Mr. Dababneh you may close.
3764	Alejo	Luis	9	LXP_ciN3hzY	1857	1876	Today we have the honorable Liduvina Magarn who's the Vice Minister of Salvadorians Abroad and is  accompanied by Mr. Daniel Ortiz, coordinator of investments and small businesses from the direction of migration and development and Annadelle Carmen Valenzuela Pena, Consulate General of El Salvador.
3765	Beall	Jim	92	7aIanLUJ17E	2	19	The Senate Committee on Transportation and Housing, we do not have a quorum at this time. However we will start as a committee of the whole and subcommittee and begin the hearing.
3766	Nielsen	Jim	68	0JAWKMIHR6Q	1058	1074	Well ladies and gentlemen, if things like the Constitution and historic water rights are antiquated and we'll change them based on contemporary circumstance even this case be a drought, what trust can people ever have in their government again?
3767	Moorlach	John	4657	HN8BzhqnJIE	1348	1362	Well, Mr. Chair I want to thank you for your graciousness. You're very kind. I just see the unfunded liability for CalPERS, CalSTRS as a 7 and a quarter percent debt, which the high interest rate, and the sooner you attack a debt, the better.
3768	Brown	Cheryl	13	wyPJESdYFaE	1765	1774	They said that they came here last year and told us that we are where they were 20 years ago and that's why they know that if we start now.
3769	Hill	Jerry	66	XOw47EwG8xI	1018	1026	- [Senator Hill] I appreciate your talking about and mentioning some of the issues that you're moving forward with to shorten the time frame a little bit in there.
3770	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	Q1ptrvjk-As	112	129	However, due to lack of funding and resources, and I would venture with also with a lack of interest and will, there are very few trainings available. This lack of awareness of Title IX can be seen in its common day interpretations.
3771	Hertzberg	Robert	99	GL6n7Ol5uP8	720	734	We're putting in statute to the extent that there is some question about cost shifting, because this really, at the end of the day is about cost shifting because it's too cheap for the first time in statute, in the amendments accepted already. So I guess the answer to the question is we already have accepted them.
3772	Weber	Shirley	44	wlFflIxZr_U	325	343	The concern among some regional centers is that these districts may not want to do that. So if they don't do it, they don't do it. I mean they may do something else. So this then becomes an entity that was not really formed by us, but formed by districts out of necessity.
3773	Nazarian	Adrin	36	KzIfF7fCyGE	1878	1900	I-- As I mentioned to you before, I didn't even pick up on that distinction. I think most of the time the bill referred to a driver as such and not an employee. The-- And this responds to several questions that have come up. All my bill-- All this bill does is codify what PUC already is asking the companies to do when it comes to the decal
3774	Hill	Jerry	66	N-Bfbq4TmhI	556	573	It's also similar to the chair's SB 493 from 2013, which also had unanimous bipartisan support. That bill required advanced practice pharmacists to communicate with physicians when they make therapeutic substitutions of medications.
3775	Quirk	Bill	23	OGSzGIXfLs8	690	713	So, this would talk, discussing constitutionality, this would talk about both the U.S. Constitution and the California Constitution? However, some measures come forward because they rightfully want to change the Constitution, because the Constitution's about this big, and has all sorts of stuff that shouldn't be in the Constitution.
3776	Stone	Jeff	26	oU8cNlNqQyg	1550	1561	I certainly support the mandate approach, but I share the same concern as the Chairwoman that we don't want to put people in harm's way for the fire or so. And I share the LAO's concerns as well.
3777	Beall	Jim	92	9IBeZ-9CMcA	43	60	This is item two, this is AB 786, Assemblyman Levine's here. And it relates to common interest development, property use and maintenance, and its urgency measures, so you have the floor at this time, Senator, and welcome.
3778	Beall	Jim	92	8y2PS2BPMgc	96	132	they want to talk or Shawn here will throw them out, okay? And we're waiting for author. We need an author to present the bill. Should we all vote before he comes, what do you think? Vote. We got an author. Okay. We are in business.
3779	Chiu	David	7	tr961U921gU	1827	1838	And I think one of the challenges, when you said at the beginning that your answer is: "As much as we can give you," obviously you're being somewhat facetious but I think everyone recognizes, you do need significantly more money.
3780	Bonta	Rob	85	Tqcxk8QJsXU	1475	1508	And remember what Medicare's role is in this bill. It's a floor, it's a starting point, it's a beginning point. The IDRP process, independent dispute resolution process, is there for special reason. It was very important to the providers, the plans were not happy with it, but it's in the bill and it allows a provider to make his or her case to neutral and raise the rate of reimbursement if they so deserve.
3781	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	eyvCaUn-6sE	621	632	Right. And so I want to make sure my students got-- don't have access to a computer lab. My students don't have handheld devices. Can I print of that bank? And I'm getting at the real practical level.
3782	Kim	Young	82	YyQcVb02jrM	1122	1148	Great. Well, you mentioned California is under investing and retaining programs to retain our manufacturing jobs here in California, so for that matter I think it is really encouraging to hear. And you asking specific questions and requests to the Legislature in terms of continuing the manufacturing tax programs.
3783	Pan	Richard	96	YFmVbaB_4iY	258	277	The Centers for Disease Control list immunizations as one of the ten great public health achievements, that resulted in adding 25 years, 25 years of life expectancy for Americans. The World Health Organization describes vaccination as second only to clean water in reducing the burden of infectious disease.
3784	Perea	Henry	33	goLRzsDXvfE	1522	1542	I think that's an important note to point out because as chair of Ag, I've had the opportunity to go up and down the state and talk to various farm bureaus and when I sat down with the Sonoma County Farm Bureau that was the single most important issue that they raised in dealing with these issues. I want to commend the author for the work that he's doing on this and respectfully ask for an Aye vote.
3785	Santiago	Miguel	17	tEhMYBdIqkE	1887	1902	cuz they don't speak the language, they're from different countries, etc. And my district director is telling us at four in the morning, 20 or something young boys and girls, probably the ages of 12 and 13, were pulled out. And you know what, they can't speak, they don't wanna speak, they're tormented, and
3786	Bonta	Rob	85	y1QKa01q6Wg	1527	1537	All right, folks, it's pretty clear about the rules here. State your name, organization and position. That's not difficult to understand, please follow the rules of the chamber. Thank you.
3787	Pan	Richard	96	37JGlYuk31E	860	876	We have groups that fight to protect our community and our most vulnerable, supporting this bill. We don't have the transit association in support because they're concerned about what happens when outbreaks happen and people say, well, gee, what a big deal.
3788	Stone	Mark	20	2cybSlRCgP0	993	1013	They are skilled and talented people and need a place to go and will be very valuable in our community in those community placements. We need to make sure, which is one of the things the Ms. Grove was trying to do in this bill. Ensure that savings money then gets invested in those communities as those placements happen.
3789	Lara	Ricardo	107	_fj8pVeO8ic	5	15	Thank you, Mr. Chair and members. Before I begin, I wanna say thank you and I accept the committee suggested amendments and thank your staff for their work on this issue.
3790	Grove	Shannon	77	2cybSlRCgP0	1362	1378	This bill allocates funds or requires funds to go to the community, support the people moving to the community, and to support the community. The community meaning the individuals living outside in the world with us. The little gentleman that done, the gentleman who delivers our mail and works in the mailroom here in the building.
3791	Mathis	Devon	75	pyW7Y47fazc	462	477	So I've got a few questions I'll be asking along the way and overall I think it's great that we're doing this. That way we can really look and see the cause and effect and how to truly help our veterans with their education.
3792	Hancock	Loni	98	YzFtbDOOfn0	855	889	Just a short question for the board and then we're going to go to public comment because we do have to adjourn at twelve. What do you see as the next steps in this. Again, I want to thank you for the hard work, for the definitions, for laying the groundwork for us. This is incredibly, incredibly important work, but we are trying to move toward evidence based, information based decision making, as opposed to more reactive piecemeal decision making.
3793	Holden	Chris	78	4HBwd3okHJI	1418	1439	I'm also accepting the Chair's proposed amendments to include prospective date language even though committee staff previously stated that it was not necessary. I'm accepting the Chair's proposed amendments to place a hard cap of 75 days on the period to cure a violation. Lastly I'm accepting amendment to clean up language.
3794	Allen	Benjamin	70	7zfeQPMxSJ4	311	319	Allayaud, they don't pronounce the Ts, with environmental working group to speak in support and assist and answer any questions and it looks like you may have a question.
3795	Nazarian	Adrin	36	KzIfF7fCyGE	2011	2031	This bill does not do anything to stifle the technology behind the business model. The business model simply does three things, takes out the metering, takes out the dispatch, takes out the transaction-- monetary transaction. It's a great idea.
3796	Nazarian	Adrin	36	KzIfF7fCyGE	2032	2050	It's phenomenal what it's done. But it does not do anything in the human element of the business. There's still a driver involved. And we don't know what this driver is up to. Right now, there's a program, Mr. Chair, called Shuddle. Just like shuttle but instead with D. And this program is an Uber for children, for the active and overly busy parents.
3797	Pan	Richard	96	1KGu-z0GNGc	1677	1693	Sure, yes. So, basically again, SB 530's permissive because the municipality does not, this bill does not require municipalities to license or allow a pedal-powered pedicab in their district, it's up to the municipality to be able to opt in.
3798	Thurmond	Tony	4	2brqaJJ9EWY	54	73	so our members will be moving in and out of the committee. If you haven't been present, I'll just share with you what we always ask our presenters, to give us the kind of high-level overview to save time for questions so that we can have healthy discussion. With that, we will turn it over. Mr. Backer, whenever you are ready.
3799	Stone	Jeff	26	3CsrxcXxpcI	979	992	I would be delighted to move this, Senator Berryhill. I want to commend you for bringing this forward. I think it's going to encourage a lot of youth that maybe haven't gone into fishing, especially because of financial issues, the opportunity to go in there.
3800	Hueso	Ben	48	xrb7OkoktfM	1750	1792	So, I'm a beneficiary of the work that he championed here in this building. So, it is with a lot of respect that I speak in honor of his service and I speak in gratitude of his service. And I'd like to mention his family, who he is survived by his four sons: Chris, Paul, Ralph, and Jeff, and their wives. He has 10 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. His loving wife Jean Chacon passed March of last year. We will miss him very much, but hopefully people do not miss
3801	Wolk	Lois	94	UOAgtw9idpM	1065	1088	Thank you, Madame Chair. This is a rather extraordinary area as Professor Moores has told us, and it's important for the Committee to understand that this effort to preserve and protect this land and work with the five counties and the various interest groups involved has gone on for many years. And I think the effort, this is not the first effort of
3802	Roth	Richard	106	WgBOQU7UIHU	759	788	So let me, I'll let you, Ma'am, you can direct the question or take it. I am looking at the analysis and the bill makes implementation contingent on an MOU between the DMV and the Selective Service, that the Selective Service will not refer to personal information required for registration to Citizen Immigrations Services, or ICE. So if that's the case, what's the concern among the community?
3803	Burke	Autumn	6	ASNmI2rHU9I	658	667	But I don't want to just poke the pharmaceutical companies. If there is a tool that comes from this I would see it as an opportunity. So that's really my question.
3804	Weber	Shirley	44	9UYl1IR1e0U	342	351	I mean they should be here testifying on behalf of the charters right now, rather than kind of punting it to us and allowing us to respond to it.
3805	Gordon	Richard	117	skOoMkG_5XA	914	930	Yeah, Covered California actually has looked at this issue and as they did an analysis, they found insignificant increases would occur in premiums in 2016, that was their analysis.
3806	Pan	Richard	96	uUsytMtXn1I	911	927	Okay. And an announcement I do have some concerns about. Given the value of new born screening, to that we not discourage people inappropriately from getting their children, newborns screened. The reason we have those newborn screens is, these are conditions in which if you don't catch it early.
3807	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	s0a4gZFkKY4	1892	1928	But to put it in this bill, and talk about it in the terms of nurse midwifery, on behalf of my daughter and myself, and I think a lot of women in today's world who benefit greatly by midwifery. I'm gonna move your bill, and I'd like to urge that we have that other conversation. In a very different context. I don't think it belongs in this bill. We mentioned 14. I mean, it's the minimis, but it's a discussion worth having. But not in this bill, so I move the bill.
3808	Calderon	Ian Charles	115	A2CxN21_Gyw	638	656	State Privacy and Security Coalition, Civil Justice Association of California, the California Chamber of Commerce, Yahoo, AOL, Facebook, TechNet and many, many others. Further, AB 691 was extensively amended in the assembly to address concerns raised by the State Bar and Judicial Council,
3809	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	rNW_uEjgPtM	0	20	Thank you, Assemblyman, for your presentation and we will now go to, oh, I'm sorry, that bill is on call. My apologies. Assemblyman Gibson, would you like to present? Or, we have another member here, if you're trying to pull together some "chits." You know I mean.
3810	Moorlach	John	4657	vuTgADMvFlA	1124	1134	Okay, so the way I read the trailer bill, it sounded like you would sell and buy other properties to build the community centers, but you're actually looking at on site?
3811	Hancock	Loni	98	a6D1KFF96cc	301	322	And a person appointed as a guardian ad litem. Or the language says, another person legally authorized to seek such relief. There's a question regarding who qualifies as another person legally authorized to seek such relief.
3812	Mitchell	Holly	64	tOhAw6uVpYA	1329	1349	and the 30 applications, they weren't approved 30 times, but could that be a case where someone goes to an application assister, they don't finish. Or they go online and start the process, don't finish, you start all over again. How do we get to the scenario where there are 30 applications?
3813	Mayes	Chad	79	XCc8jyb6PaM	1841	1851	You know one of things of course since we don't have data that's correct so we don't know how many daycare workers have been vaccinated and how many haven't.
3814	Grove	Shannon	77	skOoMkG_5XA	1567	1591	This bill no way prohibits insurance companies from providing abortion coverage, it just removes the abortion coverage requirement and brings California back in compliance with federal law. Witnesses here to testify are Alliance Defending Freedom Senior Council Casey Mattox and Senior Pastor of Calvary Chapel Chino Hills Jack Hibbs. You're on.
3815	Patterson	Jim	119	uolbChB4jBI	57	83	Thank you Mr Chairman, members the opportunity to present AB 1353. This bill brings equity to how the State of California treats blind vendors who service California's road stops and the blind vendors who service our state buildings. The business enterprise program for the blind currently gives contract priority for operating vending machines on state property to blind Californians.
3816	Leno	Mark	60	h8juzK-Kjc4	1048	1062	We're going to start with Ken Jacobs, who is director UCBerkeley labor center, followed by Professor ... And we also have Michael Harold, who's the Legislative Advocate with Western Center on Law and Poverty, who is the sponsor of this bill.
3817	Wood	Jim	72	JVAurJ3HeDI	1103	1119	Local law enforcement, local governments, and the environment would finally receive some relief in the form of the proposed excised tax in AB 243 that is long overdue. I'd also like to add that the proposed excise tax to fund law enforcement and cleanup of the environment is a bipartisan issue.
3818	Pavley	Fran	104	GeGPm9PK4o0	281	304	Noted by the EPA, potential contamination of groundwater. This report will focus on two issues that are important to me that will be addressed in a bill that's now in the Assembly, Senate Bill 248, particularly in relation to percolation ponds and how plumes could unintentionally impact groundwater supplies.
3819	Weber	Shirley	44	hSwKpjUIVVQ	1771	1781	But it would be unfortunate if we didn't fund it, it would be similar to basically starving yourself and having no money, and all of a sudden, you get some money, and you fear you might, can't feed yourself, because you may have to starve again tomorrow.
3820	Stone	Mark	20	KKyvS4cSSIw	8	22	I heard a couple times, Ms. McIntyre, and I believe, Mr. Crosby, committed to the 98% of the state. But this was brought up earlier. I think there's a distinction there, is that 98% in each region, or is that 98% overall?
3821	Leyva	Connie	62	__RebzhDkwE	764	782	Thank you, ladies. I understand there's a huge cost involved in this. But I don't think you have to worry about your junior high being asked to change their name from the Braves. I don't think there's a negative connotation there. We had a very eloquent young man come and testify before committee.
3822	Hueso	Ben	48	Pf4MoAduOhU	1598	1626	Generally, I'm very pleased that we have so much thought that takes place in the investment area. Whether it's our pension funds or our chambers that have an eye toward our trading partners to the south. And even to the north, California has a lot to do to continue to position itself cuz there's lots of competition in the world.
3823	Mitchell	Holly	64	34DjaBqbEpQ	1948	1961	I think the challenge, Mr. Stone, 'cause Senator Monning and I tried everything short of storing them in Senator Monning's garage. We really struggled with this, and we really pushed hard on the administration.
3824	Gomez	Jimmy	80	E5Lv9C_D3vg	316	335	Do pass with amendments, adding Assembly and Senate policy committee chairs to the advisory board. Two, specifying that advisory members are not paid but may have expenses covered. Three, requiring the advisory board to A, develop an annual report on the condition of higher education in California.
3825	Mullin	Kevin	31	23L8yaBtAnI	1622	1674	All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote.  All members vote who desire to vote.
3826	Weber	Shirley	44	U9EPCHTiWm8	1560	1570	Where kids of color are made to feel like they don't belong in advanced placement classes, are often times asked to leave when they're put in those classes. Are discouraged from being there.
3827	Garcia	Cristina	112	elq7nOJOh90	525	535	Megan, I expect you to become as ambitious as your brother because we need more women in elected office. Please help me welcome Dan, Jane, Caleb, and Megan to the state Assembly today.
3828	Hueso	Ben	48	dmdc2oNqHGQ	214	231	They either pose as Notary Publics or they pose as Attorneys and they use someone to access an immigrant and say, this person helped me obtain my citizenship or 5,000 or 10,000 or whatever price they can help you to do the same thing.
3829	Fuller	Jean	49	HutoDdelxCc	485	512	So, when you have those kinds of repairs as a superintendent you're usually pretty desperate. You haven't had a good repairs budget available to you over a number of years. But you're not going to find a lot of environmental things unless you find asbestos. And I don't I don't think anybody denies that if you find asbestos in the school in this day and age you've gotta take it out and generally there are some emergency funds in SAB to help with that.
3830	Hall	Isadore	1	zxPLA2x-8Hc	1675	1692	Are there any follow-up questions from the members, Senator Galgiani you're good? All right well listen, thank you Mr. Chair, thank you for your presence today and look forward to a full ratification on the floor, when it comes before us, thank you so much. Thank you.
3831	Hernandez	Ed	103	Sp1YjU0sIdc	520	533	I may get a question from. I just wanted to comment and thank you for your testimony. I think it was very courageous and very well done. And I really feel bad for the experiences you had to go through.
3832	Alejo	Luis	9	6qpSAuN2om0	509	529	Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Next bill is AB 273. This is a bill by my Environment Safety Toxic Materials Committee, which will increase the interest rate charge on billed, but unpaid notices invoices owed to DTSC to improve the timelines of collection from responsible parties.
3833	Allen	Benjamin	70	gAWN8j6c6Vc	1752	1767	And not having future generations curse us for not having taken reasonable precautions to protect those aquifers that they're going to need to access. So with that I very respectfully ask for an aye vote.
3834	Nazarian	Adrin	36	ZTmIOC6QJLc	1111	1123	Thank you, Mr Chair, you did a great job. I just wanted to make sure that we got the commitment. So thank you to the author as well. Very much appreciated to both authors. I look forward to working with you.
3835	Lara	Ricardo	107	8L0cMaLMalE	746	757	Both the minimum wage and the maximum of tax and fee rates are not automatically indexed when facing the current law. That's one of the reasons, I mean the major reason, why I'm not supporting it.
3836	Huff	Bob	105	aItBzVMycEU	1259	1283	And was very proud that France had attained 92% and then I point out that 85% of that was driven by nuclear, another 7% at that time was hydro, and we don't score any of those in California as renewable. So not only do we pick the technologies that are winners, we picked the technologies that are losers, but we then put our thumb on the scale and say which renewable can't be used and which can.
3837	Bonilla	Susan	3	MhEV1ONtJ2I	928	941	- I think some of this goes back to a hostage-taking feeling that, when we're talking about the contract, we're talking about this amendment, we're talking about the frustration that we heard in some of the budget hearings about what are we gonna do now.
3838	Hancock	Loni	98	QoWDHxezaEY	1495	1514	Thank you. Others in support? Speakers in opposition to the bill? Seeing and hearing none, it's been tried before. One more time. I think you make a good case. Are there questions or comments from members of the committee, or motion?
3839	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	8AAoooSnIWE	428	441	Wasn't a question, I was going to move the bill, so I move the bill with the additional provisal that I will work with the author of the bill to find innovative ways to find funding.
3840	Mitchell	Holly	64	gN6B3iXXHo0	2337	2356	I hope that we can come to agreement, and get closer to some language on defining what mold is and put that in statute to meet the needs of the people whose job it is, to go out and inspect everyday. And so, it's not so broad, it's not so inconsistent across the state of California, and with that, I ask for your support today.
3841	Nielsen	Jim	68	MwU2rlmXSqg	462	483	Thank you, senator. And we're wrapping up. We'll have some public comments senator and then we'll be finished up today. Fierro, I thank you very much, and, and for what you have done and would you please acknowledge some of the, your team that have worked with the, with Berkley on this project? Would like to acknowledge them at least.
3842	Mendoza	Tony	52	perI44B8dbA	1721	1732	Oh, what? This way. I read it. Okay, seeing none. Any more comments from Senate, or do I have a motion? They'll have the moved. Would you like to close.
3843	Nguyen	Janet	65	rXdeWNKFzAk	1097	1129	We'll never make it through for the next decade. So we have two problems. We have the problem of the backlog, and then we have a problem of those who are just leaving the war and finishing have no clue what's out there for them and most of them and I'll tell you, my brother served in Iraq. He went right after September 11th hit. He came back homeless.
3844	Bates	Pat	58	CfbKdUW5Buw	992	1005	We heard about the agency itself in the complexities that are there in issuing the permits. We haven't given a lot of stock to the companies that have to actually prepare these. So I'm concerned about the timeline.
3845	Thurmond	Tony	4	iq_O5tryJ2s	398	412	But you end up hearing about it in the nursing homes when, and so what would your sense be about what it would take to ramp up from a staffing standpoint, from a training standpoint. What sense do you have, if any?
3846	Chiu	David	7	_7J2e3A3mdU	323	346	Thank you. Moving to our second item, ACR 67. This is a resolution that simply states for the record that the California Legislature formally renounces and opposes a proposed ballot measure that would urge harm to be inflicted on individuals based solely on their inherent unchangeable qualities as human beings.
3847	Nielsen	Jim	68	31W9cfaQWLY	1342	1378	He was loyal to his family. He was loyal to this country. He was loyal to his party and he as a man was well loved by Doris, by his children, Marsha Ward, Peggy Macini, and had five grandchildren and one great-grandchild and also his sister Jene Baker of Camario. I ask that we adjourn in the honor of a wonderful man, a wonderful husband and father and grandfather, Buzz Folder.
3848	Gray	Adam	27	pab-ZAwjcmA	1106	1122	It is appropriate at times in government members to delegate authority but we should never delegate responsiblity. Over the next few days we will be asked to cast hundreds of important votes. It's our job. It's why people elected us.
3849	Gipson	Mike	28	m4SYy4oYAnU	1099	1114	And it could have been certainly based on some other Governors from other states here lowering them to those states. We also have Toyota leaving California and going to Texas.
3850	Irwin	Jacqui	16	i1dEPEL80sQ	739	749	You're talking about meetings and workshop: so do you have any idea, how many workshops there are? Is that in the 100s? Is it in the 10s? Is it?
3851	Grove	Shannon	77	DunUs63qSXI	334	343	And that's just an example, a bank account. They walk out with nothing and we pay, as a state you know, sixty thousand dollars over a period of time and the kid gets nothing. Absolutely, positively nothing.
3852	Grove	Shannon	77	R3SMzNAvRKs	1031	1042	Thank you Mr. Speaker. I rise in opposition of this bill. I have a great charter school in my district that wants to expand to other areas. Actually, they actually school is not in my district, the people who own the school is in my district.
3853	Lara	Ricardo	107	218-RTK66_I	6	22	Today, we have 42 bills to hear, 8 of which are eligible for do pass motions. The remaining bills are suspense items. We have a few Senate Bills from the second extraordinary session, as well. We will be operating under the same Committee rules and procedures when we get to these items.
3854	Lackey	Tom	10	-R4HGT4UbOs	566	579	Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members. It is my honor to present to you ACR11, which declares February 12th 2015 as the birthday anniversary of President Abraham Lincoln. This year marks the 150th anniversary of one of the President's most defining achievements, the thirteenth amendment, which abolished the abhorrent practice of slavery.
3855	McGuire	Mike	93	-1v9avmnxCY	1173	1184	And I just want to lay out my concerns and again, this is nothing personal against the author 'cause I think one of the best Assemblymembers that the State has, but a few items that I'd like to just lay out.
3856	Hall	Isadore	1	owIYV6IXgFg	1539	1558	Yeah, in consideration of time, I would respectfully ask for you aye vote. And want to thank our witnesses that came all the way, mostly from Los Angeles, starting at 12 o'clock last night coming down on a bus down here want to thank them for their attendance and participation. Thank you. Respectfully ask for an aye vote.
3857	Hancock	Loni	98	J0kwSkFFMEE	1341	1359	And I would note that ROCP's continue to get funding, but according to, I believe, to either the Finance or the LAO report, six of them are closing, are planning to close, and that is a huge investment that will be taken away. So, I think, to the extent that we can count on all of you to help us maintain these really proven ways. And I thank the Governor for including additional money for career pathways and for career technical education in the budget.
3858	Weber	Shirley	44	uuwAxYppIw8	2195	2221	Under, under the proposal that we just did and, and folks voted on, if you do not have a policy in place today then you will have the option. Basically we're, basically, we're somewhat being silent on it and saying, whatever you choose to do, as a policy, to view it or not view it prior to writing a report, is up to you, in your local jurisdiction. That's what we ask for, the vote on it first. We didn't get the vote.
3859	Calderon	Ian Charles	115	EmQFEn7-288	406	421	Right. We're government so things can always be a little more complicated. So I'm sure you've got to give them, you know, some type of timeline in which they have to be compliant, just like when you get a fix it ticket for your windows, you have a certain amount of time to get it taken off and then you have to show a cop and he signs it off and then you're fine.
3860	McGuire	Mike	93	LuelkxPlWfo	595	613	They agree to potentially having their home address and their names, or excuse me, and guest information being released. This bill does not ask for any guest information. In fact, home business address, number of room nights stayed, and room rate.
3861	Roth	Richard	106	KNTNNHrdr9E	680	692	And I think this goes a long way to addressing some of my concerns, and while I'm not always complimentary from the dais, I certainly wanna compliment where compliments are appropriate, and I thank you very much.
3862	Chau	Ed	116	cyEYl7uOG5U	656	678	Secondly, in 2005 an amendment to AB1742 inserted the word post-offer into subdivision D of CCP998. AB1742 was a judiciary committee onto this bill that was not controversial. There is no record in the legislative history of the bill explaining the intent of this particular amendment.
3863	Stone	Jeff	26	npLG8Ena6eQ	112	157	One example is a drug called Sufentanil that we make. It is 1000 times stronger than morphine. But, this issue today my friends is also a personal issue. Twenty years ago tomorrow, I lost my mother, Charlene, from complications of lung cancer that went to liver cancer, breast cancer.
3864	Stone	Jeff	26	aItBzVMycEU	51	78	Wind tech, one of my constituents that derives a tremendous amount of energy from the wind that comes to the Coachella Valley. A program that I helped inspire called the hero program in Riverside County allowing people to finance solar panels and water efficiency infrastructures through their property taxes.
3865	Dahle	Brian	47	ch3qK2_FbyA	602	619	before. We can't just set a target under percentage, we need to actually look at the areas of the state where we're over-producing electricity, where we're actually diverting it to other states at a very low-rate at the cost to our taxpayers and our rate payers. So, I think in the next goal, whether it's 2030
3866	Bates	Pat	58	rD0VjcELenc	2483	2495	He is survived by his three children, six grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. I ask that we adjourn in his memory today and extend our condolences to his family and friends in their loss.
3867	Thurmond	Tony	4	2b3SgDbb8jI	2061	2081	Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chair and members. I would simply just say this, that this bill has been very intentional. The City of Richmond, the city council passed a resolution outlining what a community benefits agreement might look like, and it does have things in it like project labor agreements would be expected to support the development.
3868	Hall	Isadore	1	H5As3s88-Eg	371	404	All right. Members, SB 549, Mr. Chair, members, would allow professional sports franchises to operate game day 50-50 charitable raffles to benefit local charities. 50-50 charitable raffles are raffles in which 50% of the proceeds go towards the prize, and 50% goes to a local charity designated by the team. Results of 50-50 charitable raffles in over 29 states have been tremendous.
3869	Hernandez	Ed	103	2W00giXvusA	822	839	Which I think is admirable but if somebody volunteers and they do a vision screening and they miss glaucoma or something then they're gonna get sued and if they don't have malpractice insurance they're really up the creek so I would assume it to be upon them to purchase their own or have their own. So I was just curious.
3870	Thurmond	Tony	4	V3psC7Iu1CI	1163	1179	That did get my attention. How does that play out with the patients and the consumers? And then I'm gonna ask Ms. Cantwell and others, how do we fix that? Because it seems like if we're doing this to make care better and more cost-effective, we wouldn't want anyone to have to lose their provider.
3871	McCarty	Kevin	22	tEVG8ziCjnU	332	343	With that, we'll try to catch up. Just a note for people that want to speak, we're going to do this issue and the next issue and then open up to public comment, knowing that people have specific things to address on these items.
3872	Leno	Mark	60	xOTz1OskesQ	750	774	These juvenile products are not considered a flame risk, so they don't have a flammability standard, but as you heard, products tested show that there are still flame retardants even in these products and so we know that they're still being manufactured with them, we just think that consumers should be able to know when they purchase something that they have them or they don't have them.
3873	Cooley	Ken	45	nRbBrM7qbgo	88	97	So, anyone, at this time I just want to open it to anyone who wants to come up, and just public comment on any facet of today's proceeding. Just come right up.
3874	McCarty	Kevin	22	nugSHhjUz14	1131	1155	For the Cal-State system as the Chair noted earlier, we were able to approve the CSU trust, CSU board of governors' request for fully funding $97 million to allow them to fully fund enrollment growth, which allowed us to serve 10,000 new students throughout the CSU system and expand graduation improvement efforts.
3875	Liu	Carol	63	2Yu9E6dAMwM	33	49	First item on the, we have a special order at 9 O'clock, Senator Cathleen Galgiani has a Special Education Deaf and Hard of Hearing bill this morning and we're happy to welcome you to the committee. Thank you for joining us.
3876	Hill	Jerry	66	LVzFkfmZq9U	694	710	Well, as you know, Senator Gaines, this bill applies to those few private entities that do collect license plate data, and there are just a few, and then it applies to law enforcement local municipalities and government that does it.
3877	Runner	Sharon	4656	SQEMna8rhH0	1457	1479	Local courts are the best position to make factual findings regarding county application of sex offender residency restrictions. SB 54 seeks to replace habeas petitions with a more direct county based petition process. That could expedite relief and unburden appellate courts.
3878	Cooley	Ken	45	51wXJ30ZLf4	1656	1668	The bill has been supported from day one by the California Police Chiefs Association, California League of Cities, many individual cities. And with my colleagues, I'm pleased to be here as part of this collaborative effort.
3879	Chiu	David	7	-R4HGT4UbOs	864	881	Colleagues, this concludes the business on file. We'll now adjourn to announcements and adjournments in memory. Request to adjourn in memory. There were a number of members that were granted prior permission to speak on an adjourned to memory. At this time, Assembly Member Baker, you are recognized at your desk.
3880	Gatto	Mike	46	1ddkqgmLsnY	1709	1725	Yeah, we will work with them very closely I respect the neutral opponents very much and have a good relationship with them. We're going to work with them to work through that issue and any other potential issues.
3881	Hancock	Loni	98	c8SqTr4brJk	1607	1634	I think there's strong constituencies for this one because they're best practices. They're common practice. And so, I'm comfortable and I would suggest that people who wanna maintain every mandate for whoever wants to come and ask for reimbursement, might wanna undertake another overview look of local mandates and how they're administered.
3882	Roth	Richard	106	N55wlajQ3xw	83	94	I should note that this bill has nothing to do with trying to deal with litigation and people who file lawsuits because remember we start with the premise here that we're talking about a violation.
3883	Eggman	Susan Talamantes	73	gXZO0cZqlQg	1263	1280	the city of Stockton is considering and would like To be able to enter into a contract with FPPC. So just like San Bernardino does. They're entering there next year. They would reimburse the cost. They don't have the infrastructure and our county DA has a lot more things to do than do campaign finance and
3884	Pan	Richard	96	Ydll29eHOng	1465	1480	Steve Thompson, later chief lobbyist at the California medical Association handled health issues and Mockler of course helmed education. When Brown became speaker, he asked Mockler to leave his logger practice, take a pay cut and return to the Legislature as Brown's top education adviser.
3885	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	Jfvd2Tinaec	173	195	The bills on consent are out. Six to zero. We will now move to. File item number 5, AB 480 I'm sorry, file item number 3, AB 480 by Mr. Harper. Mr. Harper.
3886	Pan	Richard	96	Ydll29eHOng	1450	1465	In the early 1970's, Mockler was a part of the dream team of consultants which Brown shared. What was then the Assembly ways and means Committee, Phil Isenberg, later Assembly Member and now Co-Chair of the Delta Stewardship Council was the chief consultant
3887	Nielsen	Jim	68	gEGAX3Ud9_I	1309	1327	Secretary Endsley, I do want to personally thank you for, you know, being a part of this and in such times of growth and there's always uncertainty. And to those residents who value that security and assurance and trust that's so important to their lives.
3888	Block	Marty	59	iMCgrPZ8vzk	260	289	or ask about immediately. But best to hold questions till the end of each panel. The first and second panels, Brian Sala summarizing the CFPB's proposal, and Commissioner Owen discussing potential state, welcome commissioner, Commissioner Owen discussing potential state regulatory impacts resulting from the proposals. Each of them have been allotted ten minutes not including member questions or
3889	Pavley	Fran	104	Q93W3yN07bU	1695	1707	It is different than the Assembly bill so different way to go about doing, addressing the problem. So I ask for your aye vote as this bill moves forward.
3890	Alejo	Luis	9	nhiEIYehp1Y	1306	1319	And what I found out is that many of our communities had the same struggles, the same hopes and dreams, the same efforts. So a lot of times we grew up thinking that we have a lot of differences. We found out that our families struggled and had the same shared experiences,
3891	Baker	Catharine	74	ehjG4WNbq0w	629	642	And it affects families, it affects generations, income, home, and so I'm pleased with the way this has been structured so that it's not, "do you like high-speed rail, I've got a long list of how I think the funds could be spent better."
3892	De Leon	Kevin	102	ze-YP1FOzwQ	1379	1403	Because first and foremost you have a fiduciary responsibility to your clients. Your clients are who? Your clients are the pensioners, teachers, and another state workers in the State of California. Just to put this in context, I think there has been perhaps a little drama in here. For Calpers, the current holdings of coal is less than 1%.
3893	Maienschein	Brian	84	J5de4fKEzMg	40	56	We've asked this panel to discuss what has happened in each of their jurisdictions amongst a number of issues including zoning or safety or permitting or complaints, and then talk about what their jurisdiction is doing to handle these issues.
3894	Gray	Adam	27	sA6uJxeRGKk	252	264	AB 1242 simply asks the Water Board to do its due diligence, supported by labor, business, government at local government, education, and ag, and I would respectfully ask for your aye vote.
3895	Hertzberg	Robert	99	519YUTER2IM	2056	2068	Briefly if I could Mr. Chair, and recognizing that it is a, you know, your're still working on this and trying to bring it together a little more. Because the challenge that I'm faced with is; the goal is certainly there, I mean we want to make sure, because some of those peaker plants, as we know, have been problems in the past.
3896	Chiu	David	7	MO4QFekCxFk	1103	1113	And we know 30 years later after the tobacco discussion we're in a very different place, and I believe that this is going to be one of those long-term public health discussions that we need to have.
3897	Garcia	Cristina	112	3bQ_hUBlpio	1846	1877	soulful spoken word that influences the likes of Nina Simone and Diana Ross decades later. These women left the stage open for many young performers today. Some of these performers you will see keynote speakers next mentoring woman of the year special ceremony. On stage and screen, women like Pearl Bailey opened our eyes. Her stage presence opened the world for women like Lena Horne and later from like Oprah Winfrey. As we gather today to celebrate the amazing accomplishments of all African-Americans
3898	Chau	Ed	116	2Dc5I9_7zFA	117	130	These ratios are based on feedback from numerous stakeholders and provide some flexibility for local governments to require parking while still reigning in the cost of parking enough to make these projects financially feasible.
3899	Cooper	Jim	21	3GyLoQagQk4	102	116	Right. But part of that, I think and I'm not here to defend law enforcement. How can we solve this and come together as a community? That's really us working together as a team. That's not me against you or them against them. So I think it's important to try and figure out what's gonna work.
3900	Beall	Jim	92	IKy1yzt0SRs	702	720	These aren't departments. They are community organizations that are providing the services. So they're not necessarily treated the same way as a state department or agency. And, therefore, in a lot of ways in their budget and appropriation profits they're discriminated against.
3901	Mathis	Devon	75	jj5fwuuTvrg	1330	1351	Consider that the project was contingent upon federal and private funds necessary for the project to be finished have never shown up and don't appear to becoming any time soon. And consider that today, 70% of voters are in favor of placing this issue back on the ballot with this new cost in mind.
3902	Wolk	Lois	94	tJoPe6FpmUg	1354	1383	In particular, I would draw your attention to the Amtrak Carter accident. There is a tremendous interest both in California and throughout the country in making certain that these trains are equipped with the highest level of technical safety equipment possible.
3903	Quirk	Bill	23	sl1U-4U9lwY	254	265	you're gonna displace food crops, the people are gonna start taking down the Amazon, as I mentioned initially. This is something I'm extremely concerned about. Do you wanna address that, or?
3904	Cannella	Anthony	61	bkbYI6-vC30	2055	2073	So hopefully, yeah, I breezed through. It was very easy. So, lots of problem we talked about. I don't want to keep, you know, discussing them, but you've got a lot of work to do get a lot of work to do to kind of turn the reputation around,
3905	Mitchell	Holly	64	X5bJGQ_T-_E	194	207	Again, over 15 years ago the CalWORKs program was a very different program. Maximum Family Grant was implemented in California before federal welfare reform, and so it was before we had a time-limited program.
3906	De Leon	Kevin	102	8-bIXhKX8x4	458	477	I would say that, and I appreciate the question, because always first and foremost, it is the fiduciary responsibility of the members of both CalPERS and CalSTRS to make sure that they hold current value, or what their optimum goal is, is to increase value of the current investment portfolio.
3907	Hancock	Loni	98	1XQMI2ofb7Y	367	382	I think the intent, as we discussed it in our committee when we worked on the budget, was that we did not want to reproduce the prison system county by county in California.
3908	Beall	Jim	92	fMvnlUAhyII	676	703	I would like to engage and discuss that at some point, because I think those recommendations about sentencing and all that other information that they recommended in that report, seem to be going the right direction of reducing crime, and also reducing the impact of public safety problems on the community from a social standpoint.
3909	Nielsen	Jim	68	_fRo9qb8Uik	445	471	But the point is that there's got to be a quid pro quo here. And if we're gonna give some abilities toward UC, say, to raise money, then we're gonna exact the price. And that price is gonna be California students, enrollments are gonna be increased. And I feel very strongly about that in terms of this budget is concerning.
3910	Stone	Jeff	26	cbnLA63gWNQ	195	207	So the public's at risk right now, so how do we fix the problem? I think that the way that fix the problem, is we get some of our traffic engineers, maybe at CalTrans, to get involved and strategically make sure that these stop signs are at the right place,
3911	Hertzberg	Robert	99	RToDyZa8pHM	868	889	And so, you know, you just don't get this appeal, this argument that everybody is going to sue all the time just doesn't happen because people are so intimidated from the process and you just say whatever, the cost is more and you pay the bill. And I don't think this argument is a proving point that the system is equitable or works, because people don't bring litigation or bring appeals. Yes.
3912	Moorlach	John	4657	pr4Lpt1U5o4	1368	1393	And so this bill is something that will offer that, as the legislative body, we are the oversight body of Caltrans, and we must implement better management tools in order to get more funding to our roads. The Legislature needs to improve Caltrans, and Caltrans needs more transparent metrics and better measurements, something that this Legislature and the public can understand and use for proper oversight.
3913	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	OaKXojP7k_0	1585	1621	We will be coming back to this, placing it on call at the request of the author's, or is the floor manager's, I should say. We will come back to that and lift the call at the appropriate time. Senator Stone moves the call. We're going to go to the following items 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, and 105. If you are the floor manager on any those, please be ready to take up your items. We're starting with file item 100, Senator Hall. Mr. Secretary, please read.
3914	Steinorth	Marc	35	bgwj3wqmbCQ	1143	1155	I'm sorry, if I may just, but, isn't it true that in Florida after initial opposition the realtors did end up supporting the transfer tax to fund the trust fund?
3915	Chavez	Rocky	83	_r5mHjpNKhY	224	234	So, because she lost that from moving from state to state. So it's also about the military family. There's also a big issue for the military bases for water.
3916	Bloom	Richard	2	Lkk9mVJ5y6k	392	409	But also provides the kind of accountability measures that will allow us confidence in knowing that the ship is going to be righted and things are gonna move forward. In a way that both, I believe the administration, and the legislature expect.
3917	Glazer	Steve	10481	4lx0MqjDD6Q	1201	1230	I asked whether there were any constructive steps we can undertake in California to discourage any embrace of the racist values of the confederacy. I was surprised to learn that we had a couple schools here in California named for Confederate General Robert E.Lee. I saw names on our streets that had been named for Confederate leaders, and had also heard from the Daughters of the Confederacy that they had placed memorial plaques in honor of Confederate President, Jefferson Davis, in California.
3918	Hertzberg	Robert	99	2QITrr6350o	1307	1320	Look, my only thought was this, I support the concept, but you have folks often certainly my kids, as roommates, going to school and stuff. You got the bigger room, you pay an extra $200 or whatever the case may be.
3919	Block	Marty	59	DuSpn9visBc	572	589	Okay, our ground rules were to give each perspective on each of these panels twenty five minutes, so even though this is a smaller panel, you will get the full twenty-five minutes. So, if you can divide twenty five by three and that's about how much time you have. We will begin with Ms. Gonzalez.
3920	Rodriguez	Freddie	69	1NMKnZlsrlM	180	191	Yeah, I just had a question, sir. If I have it here clipped onto my uniform, so the only question I had, so if I go out to put out my arms with my service weapon, would that block the view?
3921	Moorlach	John	4657	_NTagRCFfsc	2033	2058	The estimates that the franchise tax report is assuming that it will cost the general fund revenues, doesn't match with this $12 million cap. Shouldn't they be the same? If you have a $12 million per year tax credits shouldn??t you have a reduction in revenues by 12 million, as opposed to 2.7 million and 1718 and 4.6 million?
3922	Allen	Benjamin	70	EAjlHPl2xfg	27	41	They give preferential reduce cost parking access to charging stations et cetera. Are you guys working on ways that the state can identify lessons we can learn from the public sector efforts that could translate to the private-sector and work with businesses.
3923	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	rW1B4Jx9iIw	479	489	But the most important thing that I'm looking forward to doing is coming up with some solutions that will not only benefit California, but will benefit this country. Thank you.
3924	Garcia	Eduardo	38	qrJj2d7lUww	44	53	We think that what you have in your binder should be enough to help us get through this meeting. So with that we'll jump right in to item one which is AB 19,
3925	Wieckowski	Bob	55	kvK2sg30nzk	863	878	And Larry Greene is the Vice Chair of the Alliance of Regional Collaboratives for Climate Adaptation, ARCCA. Yeah, where and how can the state help the regional governance? Thank you, gentlemen and please proceed.
3926	Ting	Philip	30	5Qw_YsDfvQ4	920	937	We find that government works best when there's more transparency and more openness. Again, I just want to ask that you all sign on to ACR 41 and celebrate sunshine week this week. Thank you.
3927	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	Ve6b2OIjftM	1629	1655	There's also particularly for Los Angeles a measure afoot in order to allow counties to move local races higher for higher profile elections, a la the mayoralty of the City of Los Angeles, and the like. Which under current law would sit after the judges' races. So it would be 20th or 30th on a ballot, but.
3928	Mitchell	Holly	64	4YUeKJp9AQ0	653	677	And that they can also make the distinction between mold that is caused by a tenant and that which is not. And so we worked very hard with all of the representatives here today from the various associations to try to provide clarity. But I think it's a conversation that must continue and it's not something that can casually be dismissed because mold is everywhere. There's good mold and there's dangerous mold and we're trying to look at public health and safety which is a code enforcement officers responsibility.
3929	Leno	Mark	60	nj31ZcgCRww	506	535	Put that into some context for you, 440,000 Americans died from tobacco use. That's more than from alcohol, cocaine, heroin, homicide, suicide, fires, car accidents, and AIDS combined. And they are marketing to our children. So, I know this is a disagreement that I have with the Chair on this, but
3930	Leno	Mark	60	b8mZhVlBtpE	125	139	I know this is a particular issue to you, Senator. And would be happy to let you. So, we do have a motion from Senator Nielsen for this compromise. And the vote is 3-0. 3-0.
3931	Pan	Richard	96	8_WRsqziEsc	973	988	I wanna thank the panel for presenting today. Certainly access is an issue. One of the things that happened while I was in the Assembly was we actually had a hearing around access to dental care. And we heard from one of the dentists, a pediatric dentist,
3932	Wood	Jim	72	KcpO7Oo2ci0	1180	1202	I would like to see the HSA be deductible in California, which it is not currently as I understand it. To give people a tool to be able to do that. That would take away the argument that this somehow benefits employers, but I believe it also would stabilize things and give employees an opportunity to participate in these plans.
3933	Hueso	Ben	48	8_h1Rf31Czc	560	579	And, and, I also want to remind people that this a perspective measure. It doesn't cover all buildings, but all new construction, new buildings. And, and yes, they are for high occupancy buildings. Where three, where 200 people will be present on a continuous basis.
3934	Cooley	Ken	45	iF8zLPAheNg	1296	1313	chiefs but when I sat down with them, like in this bill that would support local control, a strong accountable agency, bringing greater public health, public safety to bear in this field that had been neglected for so long.
3935	Gomez	Jimmy	80	QXW5aikdMmE	1968	1982	AB 962, Maienschein, application of One Strike Sex Law. Hold in committee. AB 1003, Nazarian, Sexually Violent Predators Oversight Board. Hold in committee. AB 1006, Levine, Mental Health Treatment for Inmates in Prison and Jail. Hold in committee.
3936	Dababneh	Matthew	50	wtimHXTHmS8	96	104	I have today with me Ceaser Diaz of the State Building Construction Trade Councils, and he'd be happy to answer questions along with me. I appreciate your time, and I'm sorry for being late.
3937	Gomez	Jimmy	80	QXW5aikdMmE	1982	2003	AB 1019, E. Garcia, Metal Task force to combat Metal Theft and Related Recycling Crimes. Hold in committee. AB 1051, Maienschein, Human Trafficking by Gangs, due pass.  AB 1118, Bonta, procedural task force to provide grants to fund Peace Officer Procedural Justice Training. Hold in committee. A roll call. AB 1140, Bonta, Crime Victim Compensation Program.
3938	Hill	Jerry	66	9xlCmdTyLME	1005	1018	This bill is a result of a long and thorough stake holder process. We as a group have successfully addressed the concerns of Caltrans, the California Association of Sanitation agencies, and the Consumer Attorneys.
3939	Thurmond	Tony	4	wK5CwGDTeOM	330	342	We know that many students experience and need and we often don't have counselors and others who can support them. In my career as a social worker, I've spent many opportunities working with students and schools.
3940	Garcia	Cristina	112	3I7f3vKVAeA	1224	1233	But, you know what, if we were not exposed to all these toxins, it would not have the higher medical issues, would not have those struggles, that would not be paying for either medicine or my bills.
3941	Weber	Shirley	44	nugSHhjUz14	298	312	So, we are very proud of the fact that we have set out a number of priorities and we're beginning to deal with those priorities. Staying focused on a number of, clearly addressing a lot of issues, but making sure that we address those issues directly.
3942	De Leon	Kevin	102	pnu4iUzw8JA	1103	1116	I think it's quite telling that California coming off the worse economic recession since 1929 and we just recently surpassed Brazil to occupy the seventh largest economy in the world.
3943	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	-O56kS7yA2Y	1841	1866	And so I hope, as we move through this, that all of law enforcement and also the community will give managers, that are in law enforcement, an opportunity to use this footage as not something to beat officers, law enforcements over their head, but as an opportunity for them to get better, improve.
3944	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	FqvrEDpEtaY	884	892	Well that's I think the purpose of this effort is to see what we can do to make it happen. Thank you very much for your testimony and our next witness.
3945	Bloom	Richard	2	D85P8H59LjQ	286	298	Now, these last two criteria ensure that the twenty eleven bond proceeds will only be used for projects that were actively being planned prior to the government's, Governor's announcement regarding redevelopment dissolution.
3946	Hancock	Loni	98	uxTjtFWEzO4	1543	1560	And I would say that was beautifully put. Thank you very much Assemblymember and we will. This is just the beginning. We're getting started on our budget process, on our policy process and it was very important information that we got. Thank you so much.
3947	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	rek1UfAle3c	1264	1286	This particular bill, you know for certain, you've actually touched every child in California. That needs to get an education. And whether it's, whether it's private or public school operation, I think at the end of the day we're all trying to reach every school and every student in California. Thank you.
3948	Allen	Benjamin	70	UOAgtw9idpM	790	809	Which used the integral parts National Park Service system. Now I've visited, and we've create a whole bunch national monuments under the BLM and the National Forest Service in California, and I visited number of them and they just simply don't have the kinds the sort of a approach to tourism
3949	Eggman	Susan Talamantes	73	Zu2V1blghnQ	270	285	And, as I'm thinking about who's going to be my person of the year, I can think of no better person than Wilhelmina "bad to the bone" Henry who just celebrated her 95th birthday and was the first African-American teacher in Stockton and taught for over 50 years as a as an African-American woman.
3950	Roth	Richard	106	UmXyuczgH_s	1763	1777	One of the concerns, at least that I have, and I believe it's shared by some if not many of my colleagues, is that the medical exemption be fully utilized and implemented where appropriate.
3951	Eggman	Susan Talamantes	73	Zu2V1blghnQ	203	221	Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, I rise as the chair of the LGBT caucus in strong support of ACR 6, and I think Mr. Jones-Sawyer for bringing this forward today. Members, driving in today I was struck by the intersectionality of the LGBT movement as with the African-American movement.
3952	Leno	Mark	60	aagt3kLsyTc	733	747	That we pay the same rate as tax as someone who is earning $1 million, or $10 million, or in the case of many and more people $100 million a year. And hedge funds folks who are making over a billion a year, and paying a 15% tax rate, as did Mitt Romney.
3953	Alejo	Luis	9	O1x83dZ-ZdA	892	907	when he sat my brothers and my sisters around and talked about what happens when he's in so much pain. Or when he can no longer make his own decisions. At this point, that tough conversation you couldn't help but have tears coming down your eyes. When it's your father.
3954	Weber	Shirley	44	7vSg9-FP5Qk	312	331	Okay? So the question then is what happens in the process? The other thing I always ask myself when we deal with the issues of diversity, what do we expect when we get diversity? Okay? And that's important to me. It's important to me here, it's important to me in schools, it's important to me in communities and what I mean by that.
3955	Block	Marty	59	SvIBnS8_PpY	1280	1297	Number one, how close, and this is for Finance or LAO. How close does this bring us to where we were at peak per-pupil funding? And secondly, where does this put us in terms of ranking among the state's? Not an exact rank but in per-pupil spending.
3956	Eggman	Susan Talamantes	73	_NTagRCFfsc	353	363	To help alleviate the state's hunger issues and limit food waste, existing law authorizes farmers to receive a tax credit if they donate their surplus product to a food bank.
3957	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	ZcJSZ4qEe4Y	2219	2232	To solve this problem, my bill makes it clear that schools can use a committed reserve for this same purpose. And that money set aside in a committed reserve are not subject to the budget cap. It's a clarification.
3958	Mitchell	Holly	64	EK6oKbTFoPo	1490	1510	Stating something like those at the lowest, the bottom fifth in terms of income pay the highest share of their income in taxes are we going to have the opportunity to look at, kind of out of the box, new innovative concepts? Hopefully that are not regressive in nature in this extraordinary session.
3959	Thurmond	Tony	4	TlxjL0mZWIw	29	41	Anyone who knows me will tell you I'm always in a hurry and everything's always urgent. So if you would share to the task force members on our behalf, let's hurry, it's urgent.
3960	Dababneh	Matthew	50	I2yo9Y2jx-M	804	820	OK, that's good to know, so just to follow up with that, you know, I would love to partner with you guys in the future to help more of my constituents and hopefully future homeowners in my area know about your programs. Are you doing a lot outreach or are you doing marketing? Should we be providing more help with that?
3961	Nielsen	Jim	68	9_Ipr5dyo2o	1018	1061	I trust you're going to find a lot of yours in the lose category. That's not reform legislation. And it's not something that should happen in the last night of session. And there was certainly a paucity of individuals or representatives of the cities, and counties, and Committee having any opinion on this legislation. Except mostly whoever did say, had concerns and didn't like it including some very small ones. But who surely were absent, they don't even know about this
3962	Beall	Jim	92	Zz925hDmty8	816	860	It's probably one of the highest in the State of California. And I think that is the number one. That is a reason to be very sensitive to the critical nature of protecting this particular district. So I think it, the issue overwhelms some of the questions that we might have about the timing and uncomfortableness about this measure, because I think we should do all we can to make sure that the downside doesn't happen. And that's what I'm concerned about.
3963	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	xbFtMrlj2T4	1103	1113	I mean, that'd be great. We should do that for my water bottles. But- I don't want to bring up other problems. But look, this is an ongoing issue.
3964	Kim	Young	82	P8Zs2L1mwlY	297	324	So instead of just, just asking this body and the state to provide you with more money, so you can enroll more students. I think this is why we're having these hearings here.  To make you think about different ways that you can probably cut costs from one place, and then just try to use it so that you can enroll more. And I see it right here. We're discussing it.
3965	Gatto	Mike	46	C4Es45e97Xo	58	86	So, our course, this would not ban voice recognition. It would not affect it in any way. It would also not ban using your television to do a Skype call or anything like that. This would simply require a one-time consent with a separate notice and it would require televisions that have voice recognition mechanisms that allow consumers to affirmatively choose to use the feature, to start and stop the feature, and to understand that when the feature is on transmitting words.
3966	Gomez	Jimmy	80	RChcWpGW4gA	1047	1057	Thank you so much. We have a motion by Quirk, we have a second by Weber, it's do pass. It's out on an a roll call with Jones, no.
3967	Roth	Richard	106	UmXyuczgH_s	1777	1793	One of my concerns has to do with the reward payment being made for those who have been vaccinated, but not for those who a medical exemption was granted.
3968	Beall	Jim	92	898OiW72jWg	822	848	Now, I kind of think this is something that sounded more like I'd like to work with you on, as we talked about, as opposed to this particular way of dealing with that issue. Cuz I think project delivery, evaluating whether it's better to do a contract versus an inside, that's kind of what we're talking about here.
3969	Nguyen	Janet	65	WJQRNP9q0xQ	1566	1585	It could cost hundred, two, $300,000 dollars down the road versus being able just do it immediately for fifty thousand. And so, you know, we've had, you know, a lot of the local governments, cities, and counties rather not go through with it and just don't bother because it's so costly and the time and etc.
3970	McGuire	Mike	93	e-eay8FdlZA	130	151	Can I ask you- I don't mean to interrupt, not at all trying to be pushy on this, but when you say you're working on it. So we're collecting data like, we're not collecting of what psychosocial services the children access prior to being prescribed medication, correct?
3971	Monning	Bill	25	BSQ4q6mJlLM	691	716	Unfortunately, this was not an isolated experience. In California, there were 5,327 truck collisions reported in 2012, of which 235 involved fatalities. Hearing the motion and the second, I'll spare you some of this. I'm glad to answer questions. Basically, this legislation, it's one supported by California Trucking Association, California Highway Patrol.
3972	Mathis	Devon	75	U0AuDbfVwBc	1593	1616	So there's plenty of data right there. You have the tools in front of you Ma'am to develop a time frame, there was a time frame in place. I don't see why we're spending time going forward, where there is not a time frame in place to get things done and take care of people. Makes absolutely no sense. That's all.
3973	Pan	Richard	96	h3qpDny4S5o	1097	1111	We would definitely like to see that including the methodology because obviously without the methodology. And, then, you know, you did mention that you're going to be doing the you know, rate survey in July.
3974	Chiu	David	7	ZLSVJllIZyI	719	730	That suit was thrown out by the courts almost immediately. In fact, we assume that everything that HomeAway said in their statements were true and the court rejected it at that point, but I do want to follow up on your statement.
3975	Cannella	Anthony	61	CKcxsxPbopg	113	158	Bruce Presser the Incoming President Representing American Council of Engineering Companies, Ryan Kirsting, the Board President, Krista Loosa the board Vice President, and iIcoming Board President Don Shinske the Executive Director representing the Structural Eengineers Association of California, Oscar Serrano representing the American Society of Civil Engineers, and Eric Johnson on behalf of the board of Professional Engineers Land Surveyors and Geologists. Thank you again, colleagues and I ask your support on SR 12.
3976	Gaines	Ted	24	zKRXexcG8LM	709	723	Thank you, Senator Mendoza. Members any debate or discussion? Seeing none, members, any objection to using our unanimous roll call? Seeing none, aye's - 40, no's - 0, measure passes.
3977	Wieckowski	Bob	55	xJqN87zbSDI	634	654	To just clearly state, it requires a different operation and maintenance is required as part of the corrective action, that the cost recovery action shall be commenced by the department within three years of the certification of that operation and maintenance. So, we're all clear. Members or anybody in support AB 275 that'd like to be heard?
3978	Beall	Jim	92	kIQkyQM4CnQ	1153	1180	So you didn't put this drug substance treatment in the budget for some reason as opposed to not funding some other stuff, right? You thought this was a lower priority, so it came into the recidivism reduction refund request as opposed to just putting it in the regular part of the department of corrections budget, right?
3979	Pan	Richard	96	1KGu-z0GNGc	835	844	And here to testify their support are Jason Blessinger, co-owner of Off the Chain from Sacramento and I also have Alex Give here who's present to answer any questions. Thank you.
3980	Hertzberg	Robert	99	wHx-nZg7Thw	819	832	Ten percent of the purchase is cash back going into these accounts for savings accounts for kids, to help out their futures. My point is, and then when I talk to them, the whole nature of it is, is just not after the credit card anymore.
3981	Hernandez	Ed	103	tMpsiN_Q_5M	1198	1215	Thank you. I believe-- [ Inaudible Remark ] There is one more comment, that wanted to be made in all fairness, we'll give just a little bit more time and whatever exact time for the proponents, we will give to the opponents as well. I believe-- no one else? We're okay?
3982	Mullin	Kevin	31	sR3YZBZSyxQ	386	405	Thank you, Mr. Alejo. Seeing no discussion on the item, clerk will open the roll. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. Clerk will close the roll and tally the vote, aye's - 46, no's - 22, Senate amendments are concurred in.
3983	Wood	Jim	72	fnhJHfsu-gk	318	338	First of all, I wanna thank you, the panelists. I think I really appreciate your presentations, and having been a provider, a dental provider, for almost 30 years, I get it. And Medi-Cal provider for a very long time. Obviously the cuts that happened in '09 In my opinion, really decimated our provider system, whether it's hospitals or physicians or dentists.
3984	Williams	Das	12	P6cBeme--dw	82	102	That means, statistically, 12% of people would live longer than that six months, some of them for many years. And, just so that you don't think that the story from our colleague from Compton is rare, I was approached by a fellow just randomly at the democratic picnic on Monday about this very matter.
3985	Hertzberg	Robert	99	qTf-RqJKEFo	524	532	to be held hostage so you could pay your employees. You know, you don't make any money because it's not-for-profit don't make any money. They're just trying to provide services. Probably a lot less go.
3986	Wolk	Lois	94	8KUeGOeE6yE	302	322	Yes. It may water up, but I'm not sure yet. When it emerged from this committee, there was, this is, in a sense, a work in progress. There's some interest in a broader agreement, including the billing folks and the tenants. We're gonna try.
3987	De Leon	Kevin	102	IKESHE_NOXc	1422	1442	Thank you very much Madame President. Colleagues before us we have two, I should say three, government appointments: Jamie Wright, Felix Yeep, as well as Rustle Attebery. These appointees were heard in Rules Committee February Fourth and approved in a bipartisan vote 5 to 0, there was no opposition and the
3988	Steinorth	Marc	35	3bQ_hUBlpio	618	638	Now, our family believes in a good education. We also believe that experience will come in handy in most cases. So my daughter is 15. In 12 years, she will be passing me when I term out and taking over my seat. Just so you know.
3989	Cooley	Ken	45	ufpnr2TGLO8	981	1000	I encourage you to ask a member of your staff just to kinda learn what's there and take note of it as a general matter of public policy. I think the opportunity for our group of legislators is to kinda understand what is the state of the law, which is bequeathed to us by our predecessors.
3990	Beall	Jim	92	GE9yKeDoFKQ	1438	1466	This bill in the Alum Rock school district located in East San Jose is a pilot project that extends the hours of preschools, eliminates paperwork burden for families wishing to enlist their child in a program, with recent amendments authorizes eligible students up to transitional kindergarten.
3991	De Leon	Kevin	102	IKESHE_NOXc	1492	1506	are appointees to be members of the California medical board and Mr. Russell Attebery is a member of the Native American Heritage Commission with that, Madame President as well as colleagues I respectfully ask for an aye vote.
3992	Hueso	Ben	48	xL36G7ytN6U	663	687	Thank you, madame President, I also rise in support of this bill. Principle co-author on this bill, I want to thank my colleague, Senator Leno, for all his work on this issue. We've had several hearings on the subject, we've had stake holder hearings. We've been working with the community at large to really get down to whether a bill is really needed in this area.
3993	Hueso	Ben	48	xL36G7ytN6U	687	704	And I guess that has been established by this process. We need further transparency. We need commissioners that are objective in making these decisions, where they're looking out for the rate payers, and everybody involved in these rate setting decisions.
3994	Nazarian	Adrin	36	leAiZf7wn9s	1367	1383	But now let's look at the list further. When identified as a gang member by an untested informant. Okay, local kids having an issue. One not knowing at a youthful age the consequence of what it's going to mean to stain someone's life by informing.
3995	Quirk	Bill	23	zsDLiRLL6-I	905	928	You're good. All right, thank you very much. Excellent. Again, Attorney Bibring, if you've gotten specific proposals to our Public Safety staff as the PORAC and the LA Police Protective League have done, that would be very helpful to us.
3996	Pavley	Fran	104	BNQtV-nHj20	180	193	Which is not listed on the back. It is a late letter but thank you for pointing it out. There is no opposition to the bill, and you can see members on the back side of your information sheet, the support list.
3997	Irwin	Jacqui	16	oIrgXGq-Z_I	313	332	So if you have the electric system, the electric grid being attacked, and they're able to share that information, and again, this is completely voluntary, if they're able to share that information with other players in the utility grid, so that they can protect themselves, it really helps all Californians.
3998	McGuire	Mike	93	woVTT_HPcvA	556	575	VSOs will still need to apply for an alcohol license, and all training requirements for bartenders will still apply. The main purpose of all non-profit veteran service organizations, has been to close the gap of services between the Department of Veteran's Affairs, and veterans.
3999	Allen	Benjamin	70	3ZbkIQK-LEk	1684	1709	Certainly pre-1900 there was nothing there and so there was no reef. But I wonder whether the presence of the reef really outweighs you know all the costs associated with removal. And I don't just mean economic. I mean you know having to ship these things, solder them underground, sorry underwater, etcetera.
4000	Alejo	Luis	9	OGSzGIXfLs8	545	562	Thank you so much. Any other witnesses in support? Individuals from the public in support? Witnesses in opposition, individuals from the public in opposition? Questions or comments from the committee members? I'm gonna, Mr. Rendon, I support this bill.
4001	Mitchell	Holly	64	9eBx3f-E0dc	41	76	We'll hear today both from our invited panelists as well as those who are in the room today who wish to testify during public testimony at the end of hearing. But we're also listening to those who are watching via live stream and we'll work to integrate your thoughts, experiences, and questions via Tweet and Facebook into the latest discussion. To participate use #endpovertyCalifornia, excuse me, #endpovertyCA, all caps. Again, that's #endpovertyCA, CA is of course capitalized.
4002	Anderson	Joel	57	_4l4q_6Hap0	1659	1679	This opt-out program assumes I'm gonna vote her. So why should I deny what you're assuming. I'm more inclined to make that error, because maybe the notice that's coming to me is in the wrong language. Or maybe I have a disability and I can't read it for whatever reason, or understand it for whatever reason.
4003	Mitchell	Holly	64	9eBx3f-E0dc	32	40	But I'd like to welcome all of you here in the audience as well as those who are tuning in via Senate television or are looking on, on your computer.
4004	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	SM79vxJ_AdE	237	252	With AB 1461 it's our hope that California will register the nearly 6.5 million unregistered citizens, and then simply focus on getting them out to vote. Additionally while it's important what this bill does, it's equally important to say what this bill does not do.
4005	Gatto	Mike	46	kAZMIWno7zI	802	814	I've signed up for a lot of websites in my time, and when you log in, or when you sign up, there's often that disclosure in, you know, eight-point font that you have to click accept to before you can become a member of that website.
4006	Allen	Benjamin	70	QnBcTK-as8k	348	370	Which is so easily checked and verifiable, to other locations. And, so I think it's very much, you know, I understand your concerns with the broader policy that the State's passed. But this particular bill, I actually think, helps to take this a little step further in supporting the integrity of the process and the system.
4007	Atkins	Toni	110	yGdC7D9fPQ8	1678	1696	Like my colleague said, I do not want to see eight years more before we find a way to look at the infrastructure throughout the state. We have an incredible opportunity. So while there may be issues we need to continue to work on, I would urge this body to support this action today.
4008	Gomez	Jimmy	80	JgpqDSrKaXw	1456	1472	The Republicans not voting. AB282, Eggman, Corded Window Coverings due pass amended to narrow the bill to apply only to windows coverings that do not meet federal safety standards. B roll call. AB287, Gordon, places conditions on the sale and lease of vehicles subject to recalls.
4009	Wood	Jim	72	WE6m9wVcbNQ	357	389	Couple other follow-up questions, through the chair. You said, there are lots of other chemicals in these vapors. There are and I think it would be hard to deny that. When someone exhales this, you see this vapor. There are other chemicals, I'm not aware of studies that have been done to say whether they're harmful or not, but I believe one of you said the vapor is essentially harmless, but then you I believe said, that it's 95% less hazardous. Which implies that there still is a hazard, correct?
4010	Mathis	Devon	75	TSE2ocY_LpM	1237	1263	traditional financing, such as bank loans or other state and federal programs, to deepen or improve their existing groundwater wells, connect to their local service lines, and install systems to treat contaminated ground water. This bill provides tools to some of our poorest and most vulnerable communities to enable them to regain a bare minimum quality
4011	Leno	Mark	60	xusZRk9gg60	971	993	separated into three different sizes, based on average daily attendance. We can make sure that all size districts are able to compete and keep it as a competitive grant program, as the Governor had proposed. So balancing the dual needs of both quality programs, as well as the equity issue, so.
4012	Obernolte	Jay	86	CRMwg6_WO3E	847	858	I'll take a point of personal privilege. Mason's rules of legislative procedure dictate we should address each other by our point of origin and not by our proper names, if you would please instruct the gentleman.
4013	Bloom	Richard	2	KzIfF7fCyGE	1445	1470	Secondly, the requirement for a permanent designation I think should be changed to require placards in windows which is what's commonly being utilized by the TNCs today. And I think it should delete the individual vehicle registration requirement because I frankly think that for this model, that's not a workable requirement.
4014	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	eibZ1b56Plc	574	598	Well, in this case, this would have amounted to about $20,000, in a $100 million clean up. That's before we even get into the litigation for the costs associated with this spill to the communities, to small businesses, which suffered tremendously because of the spill. So this is a minimal at best, and in trying to work with
4015	Steinorth	Marc	35	cyEYl7uOG5U	56	71	So AB1342 supports the California Commission on the Disability Access by increasing its funding and establishing certain requirements upon the CCDA, the Division of the State Architect and commercial property owners which relate to disability access.
4016	Bonta	Rob	85	r81aKKdk2dA	429	441	And I think there's a sort of implicit suggestion in there that additional regulation may not add a lot of value, especially when you consider the additional costs. Costs that of course are reimbursable but there's a time lag for them.
4017	Bloom	Richard	2	-bJq_JGSuxY	1274	1298	and the Energy Efficiency Council, a nonprofit trade organization of consultants and specialty contractors, who provide energy efficiency education and installation services statewide for low to moderate income rate pairs. All of these groups support the bill. In the opposition testimony today, you may hear that utilities need flexibility rather than mandates,
4018	Stone	Jeff	26	GIcgVGMKBjg	1708	1727	Is this not just more of a duplication that is ultimately going to be placing our farmers and those that use water responsibly in harm's way of yet more government intervention and more fines? I would wish that we could take this provision out of this bill so I could support it.
4019	Gordon	Richard	117	1WV4YJ98mc4	637	662	If you would add a request to staff to clarify in the description of the organics programs at Cal Recycle. That sustainable disposal and use of bio-solids would be one of the things that could be funded from that. Then I would second the motion.
4020	Leno	Mark	60	6d5kBV-0MQs	1127	1138	Think you're moving in the right direction. Did you have anything else to add? Okay, so we do have a motion. It is the Senate version. It is 3-0 on the Senate side and 3-0 on the Assembly side.
4021	Weber	Shirley	44	1dDkNt95rgU	1398	1410	This basically bill passed through, and it's interesting, now that it's funded, it passed through all the committees and the floor of the assembly with unanimous votes of everybody because of the fact that we want the expansion of these services.
4022	Gallagher	James	108	bzJzCS8XdVc	1536	1551	So even though I understand your motivation to move forward I can't support the bill because we're assuming that DACA and DAPA are constitutional. And I don't think they are. Because I don't think the executive branch has the power to make immigration law, Congress does.
4023	Bonilla	Susan	3	2W00giXvusA	58	77	California has seen many detrimental effects for our outdated statute. Cytotechnologists are leaving the state to practice at a higher level in neighboring states. California is only one of the few states which prevent cytotechnologists from being able to perform modern diagnostic tests, including the HPV test.
4024	Wood	Jim	72	2aV-8k1n6pw	98	121	And the clinics in those dental schools are a big part of what makes dental education affordable. So when you have a 10% cut, that affects the clinic income. In order to make up for that lost income for the dental clinics, and quite frankly a lot of these clinics are providing service to Medi-Cal patients, a lot of them with really complex dental problems,
4025	Gallagher	James	108	yGdC7D9fPQ8	418	439	Fish and Wildlife is concerned with fish. They're concerned with wildlife. They're concerned with biology. They are not experts in hydrology and water rights. That's what the Water Resources Control Board is for. We need to respect that process and we need to respect due process rights and let's not say that this is under the auspices of just going after marijuana growers.
4026	Gallagher	James	108	yGdC7D9fPQ8	367	389	And let me just give you a real-life story because this actually happened last year. Up in my district along the deer creek, Fish and Game had made a determination that the flows needed in that stream require that there be a curtailment along those streams and a severe curtailment to farmers and ranchers who use that water along that stream.
4027	Bates	Pat	58	SM79vxJ_AdE	1328	1362	And in particular, I think the people who are new to our community, new to our country, they came here because we're offering them a new life. A new opportunity, democracy, and living by rule of law and we can't let that erode. And it will erode if we don't get more people involved. So I'm not going to support this today. I think you're working very hard, and I'm so excited and respectful of that. But, let's put another piece in this and try to find out what's going to make the difference.
4028	Rodriguez	Freddie	69	2IKoCnJyE-g	599	617	I mean, all you're doing is delaying emergency medical care to the next victim out there, the next accident. So just from my experience, I think 30 minutes would probably be the longest anybody should be waiting in an ER, and the time should start by the time you arrive because like I said even though you enter that facility, I can admit.
4029	Hernandez	Roger	37	ZHlQISHQoPg	2134	2157	Sergeants, sergeants, please remove the mic. Remove the mic. Please remove the mic. You're yelling, you're out of order, you've not been recognized. Sorry, remove the mic. I'm running the meeting. Not the sergeant.
4030	Monning	Bill	25	suW9diU5Tzo	149	178	The data is very troubling, nearly one in four foster youth receive powerful psychotropic drugs. Of all the children taking psychotropic medications in California, 52% are given antipsychotic which have risks factors that can lead to lifelong disabilities such as tremors, obesity and diabetes, 48% of foster youth are given antidepressants that have an FDA black box label warning use by children.
4031	Block	Marty	59	FoClVNhVQAg	1267	1298	Thank you Mr. Chair. Looking out here and seeing Kathy Bowler who testified and Frank Ruffino there and others I'm sure who are public members of boards. A concern I have is the indemnification issue. We don't want the state to protect people who are evil doers out there on these boards but on the otherhand, we have a lot of citizens who in good faith are giving of their time and their expertise to help the state, to help consumers, and we want to make sure that we protect these board members.
4032	Mitchell	Holly	64	cXnV6IOLWSg	472	509	File item 55, Senator Leyva. File item 56, Senator Runner. File item 57, Senator Block. File item 60, Senator Beall. File item 61, Senator Pan. File item 62, Senator Anderson. File item 63, Senator Block. And file item 65, Senator Jackson. In that order, members please be prepared.
4033	Pan	Richard	96	JM1ztwrhmks	860	868	But at the same time, I think people are concerned about ... But one thing I did want to follow up since so I asked the previous panel and now we have someone from PhRMA here,
4034	Beall	Jim	92	u1CD9eH0kHI	282	290	I think it would help us in this Committee, but also in the reality sense, help us in the other committees that are working on the special session, so thank you.
4035	Eggman	Susan Talamantes	73	x4d8DYXm7og	1629	1638	districts like mine and many of yours, have waited to be part of California's green economy. We think this bill does it. I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
4036	Wood	Jim	72	1ZfwQ7P4YFk	933	951	Follow up if that's okay sir? How does some of this translate to rural communities for example. Different challenges, and access is a big issue, whether you're an urban area or rural area.
4037	Jones	Brian	42	UonYQneKEjk	1907	1934	No this is for real. Settle down Mr Harper. As I said, I support the bill, I think it's a good idea. I think that the problem you're trying to solve here is also applicable to other government executives. So could you talk to us about Fire Chiefs, Police Chiefs, City Managers, and other positions like that and and why they're not included in the bill or what you intend to do in the future about those positions as well?
4038	Quirk	Bill	23	i3P-QI4InjM	1680	1699	Having worked as a city council member, every time I have worked with these agencies, developers, they usually will bend over backwards to make sure that all your questions are answered. That they get something which will go ahead smoothly.
4039	Weber	Shirley	44	8YNqtXYvNaM	1625	1636	They lack a place to stay and as a result, that's a major issue in terms of providing them with some form of shelter. Then they could move to take advantage of the counseling and rebuild their lives and so forth and so on.
4040	Steinorth	Marc	35	i194v81Ek5E	1659	1670	It's, it's become a way of life for all of Californians who want to stay in communication with their family members. This is also something that the Board of Equalization is looking for guidance from this body.
4041	Gomez	Jimmy	80	mEidzFiLEmY	1303	1318	Thank you so much. Any other witnesses in support, individuals from the public in support, witnesses in opposition, individuals from the public in opposition? Department of file, Department of Finance no file, moving too fast. Any questions or comments from the committee members?
4042	Nazarian	Adrin	36	6sTB7NUOGtE	1107	1146	So we're gonna be here, along with members from the DCA. Just to see if there is any other questions. Not yet. Thank you. While we're waiting, why don't we go through all, and any potential missed votes. So, the vote only calendar item.
4043	Leno	Mark	60	HpHzTWJvRTs	1333	1359	Well stated. Clearly more information's better and we could benefit from it. Curious though, do we as legislative body have much of a history with directing these kinds of analyses from you and if we do, is it appropriate that we might fund your services additionally on top of everything else that you're doing and how labor intensive is such an analysis for you?
4044	Levine	Marc	8	Rt-g3tEX78Q	741	757	They're in their second-year as a new school in Petaluma. In the gallery we have 47 fourth, fifth, and sixth-graders, their principle Doctor Carlos Uloja, and two teachers Jeremy Smith and Katie Boss. Please join me in welcoming the students from Loma Vista Immersion Academy and their 23 adults and chaperones today.
4045	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	KLz991S1PxQ	706	733	And so that hopefully increased the number of minorities that were able to get employed in the city of LA. I don't think you have anything like that here. And with Prop 209 you probably couldn't do anything like that, but at least we should have something in place that gives managers an opportunity, who have that notion that we need to get the best qualified, but people with a diverse background.
4046	Wieckowski	Bob	55	r0_c68VZXFY	1321	1341	Every single additional dollar that they earn is taken from her paycheck, and then she's knocked back down to the $9 per hour. This bill addresses that. This is the case even in communities that have enacted a higher minimum wage, because they believe that people living in their jurisdiction should be compensated at a higher level.
4047	Huff	Bob	105	pjSDFWGC8xY	591	609	And then, they did that back in the latter 90s. We ended up with some creative triple flip or whatever, and so here we are today. But that is something that I would not be opposed to pulling out for the purpose of trying to fit the cure with the problem.
4048	Bloom	Richard	2	FgksiwkXKF4	1642	1658	these clusters are often well loved parts of cities, and can be found throughout the state, including your own Districts. AB 189 will allow the California Arts Council to designate these kinds of areas as official California cultural districts.
4049	Dodd	Bill	71	JKPJXBAVEPo	1034	1062	Yeah, in our research of that, it's been exceedingly rare circumstances. In fact, this is the only one of its kind, and many, many things could have protected those people that day absent any of these things being done, like driver education, not overloading the limousine, but I think driver education and training is probably the biggest thing and that was in Senator Hill's bill and that will still be a requirement. No changes.
4050	Leno	Mark	60	bWj7FpZXUfY	2191	2219	I should have prefaced my comments that I'm in full support but thank you for helping me walk through this exchange with Ms. Petack because I do understand that even without a contract, with the fact of social media, it's not the story in a newspaper until it becomes a real deal, but that there's chatter because the perpetrator was initiating the chatter and that that revictimizes again as well. So across my suggestion.
4051	Nielsen	Jim	68	TtIXT0N3vvo	490	508	Are those impositions extinguished at the end of the drought? I think that is an important point that needs to be cleared up and it has not been thus far. In that legislation, the board hasn't been empowered to do some pretty substantial enforcement.
4052	McGuire	Mike	93	sy4t4DpLFas	422	437	This was the most environmentally preferred alternative that we have ever seen brought forward in modern time. Yet it was rejected. And time and time again, the State Lands Commission has brought forward quit claims every chance they get to stop offshore oil.
4053	Chau	Ed	116	jsJrqv78Trc	1116	1127	I do have a couple of follow-up questions. I think earlier, you mentioned about the Federal Housing Trust Fund. How much, in terms of dollars, can we expect to get in from that, the trust fund?
4054	Mendoza	Tony	52	MpQ4SGzO7GE	1338	1346	of our residents when your hands are tied with an issue like this, I think this bill is very necessary and I would like to make a mo, a motion. I would like to move the bill.
4055	Frazier	Jim	114	fSCMT0VJDKw	413	430	However, there remains a significant teenage driver safety problem, and additional work is needed to further reduce deaths and injuries for this vulnerable population. As I had in my district two days ago, a 16-year-old died from speed-related injuries.
4056	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	oC8-KbPE6Yo	653	678	The next item is SB 221. This is I think a very helpful way to address our wounded veterans as they transition to work. And this is a problem that has existed for some time and continues to exist as our veterans come home from deployment and
4057	Perea	Henry	33	3kfM97VupkU	238	264	Well, we wanted to be careful in how we crafted this. And really what we were looking to do is begin a start date for our program when the other ended. And so I'm not sure where the idea of taking from one, so maybe I'll ask my sponsors or some of our advocates to answer that question.
4058	Wood	Jim	72	X-EMNVy0KVE	445	463	The high is intense and the effects are almost immediate. The epidemic of drug abuse disproportionately affects our young people. 70% of the people abusing these powerful pain medications report getting this medication from a friend or a family member.
4059	Garcia	Eduardo	38	xnlrOV-AGaQ	1616	1659	So I just wanna say that the rationale behind the question is when we look at the studies that have done, in terms of the economic impacts over the course of the years, we're talking about $70 billion dollars. Course, putting a price tag on the ecosystem and the environmental impacts are enormous, right. It's difficult to put a number on that and even more so when you're talking about the health and wellbeing of people, right. How do you, what formula do you use in quantify, and say it is equivalent to or not. So that's the rationale behind asking the question if we were to pursue the $9 billion project then, would that have been the least of the expensive options before us, right?
4060	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	ZhE_hzRecAQ	1132	1158	All right. Colleagues, I know there are a number of bills that we haven't taken up. What I would like to do is if you would like to take up an item that we skipped earlier, I'd like to go through the file as we are doing, we will put those items at the bottom so that we don't have to keep going back and forth. So we are now at file item 133, excuse me, 134.
4061	Monning	Bill	25	msMPqU5kPd8	790	807	But one child will die out of every 10 who gets tetanus. Of 1000, without measles vaccine, one will die. And in 100,000 of older children who contract chickenpox, one will die.
4062	Hancock	Loni	98	pvvkVbDJBVE	1412	1432	As his daughter Robin said to me when we talked last night, "Lee Marsh, a life well-lived." I hope the Legislature will join me in adjourning in memory of this very wonderful man.
4063	Cooper	Jim	21	VjN2j4PuSG8	630	647	And this nicotine, the bottom line is they're still inhaling it and you know if want a cessation, I really don't have a lot of faith in that to be honest. That's just something that sounds good hey, there's no nicotine in it and it appeals to kids. I'm out in the streets a lot, I see a lot of kids using these. There's an issue with it.
4064	Roth	Richard	106	IUqqKj1b5UE	226	253	So I guess my question is this. If the patient's not in the physical emergency room and I don't remember exactly where the patient was, would there be problems with the 24 hour rule? How, how would that be handled? What complications does that present for hospitals that can't find in the case of the psychiatric patient, or one that appears to be, have psychiatric issues, what problems does that pose, does this bill pose if any?
4065	Leno	Mark	60	11yyICoQ5m8	971	983	Do we pass it to the fiscal committee and then not only expect that they would, in appropriations, figure out the answers to all the questions we're raising here today?
4066	Weber	Shirley	44	AHTUrQ6AUYA	176	189	But we've never had a consistent program that really addresses this population, and as a result, we often wonder why is it that students who are born in this country, who speak English, actually score less on test scores than kids who are coming into the country not speaking English.
4067	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	kMP7GilTLLE	113	130	I want to thank them, they have worked very hard. We're very close to an agreement here. I'm hoping that that happens, I think it's very likely, we've just get one small concern now but this bill is going to help to close the wage gap in several important ways.
4068	Atkins	Toni	110	m4t87KOfLMk	93	110	Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. I am pleased to be before you again to talk about AB 1288 in a certainly substantively different form. Happy to see my principal co-author, Senator Pavley here.
4069	Roth	Richard	106	JB8xflm0bpc	1502	1528	I too represent Riverside County, at least portions of it, and it's a very challenged area like many in Southern California where frankly, there's a geographic separation of affordable housing from jobs, and many people, many of them of fairly low income drive substantial distances to try to make a living and support their families.
4070	Jones	Brian	42	9mjyTPfbhPw	749	778	to allow this bill to come to the floor during the second extraordinary session. So I believe that allows Mr Hadley the right, and the ability, and the time to read the declaration of the second extraordinary session. And Mr. Speaker, I would ask specifically of you that if there are any further interruptions of Mr. Hadley's reading of that declaration, that you would rule not well taken. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
4071	Lara	Ricardo	107	I17DTXkdVm0	6	37	We'll bring it to order. We're going to start with the subcommittee until we get enough members to establish quorum. Today, we have 101 bills on file, only eight of which are eligible for a due pass motion. The remaining bills are suspense-items. Four bills that are listed in the daily file will not be heard today. Those are SBs 119 and 541 by Senator Hill, SB 585 by Senator Leyva, and SB 602 by Senator Monning
4072	Hancock	Loni	98	B0PWp2aeSfk	173	197	Well, I just want to remind everybody that when we passed the blueprint three years ago now, we talked about actually saving money for the people of California, as well as increasing capacity.
4073	Mullin	Kevin	31	etnGLuiVGv4	1656	1682	Thank you Mr. Dodd. Seeing no discussion or debate on the resolution, clerk will open the roll. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote.  Clerk will close the role, tally the vote. Ayes 68. No's one.
4074	Wolk	Lois	94	OKwBdjBCkE8	223	244	Yes, I will briefly. I want to thank Senator Jackson for the comment. There probably is an answer to that question, I just don't have it. But I'm sure that Senator Fuller and I could work with appropriate folks to find out the answer to that and what can be done about eliminating it.
4075	Roth	Richard	106	omT12LxK-8I	795	804	Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'll be supporting the bill today. But I do want to associate myself with the comments of Senators Pan and Wolk with respect to the transfer agreements.
4076	De Leon	Kevin	102	nVE2-FVOyaQ	992	1019	Yeah, Richard Mullen at Cal Iso was the potential exportation of thermal coal in event that the merger happens. Obviously the IOUs have extremely limited coal exportation to California to generate electricity we have some MOUs obviously, Los Angeles, primarily LADWP.
4077	McGuire	Mike	93	0yf1SfBcDOs	1805	1822	And I'm a firm believer that we do need to find some skin in the game to put in for transportation. Are we gonna need some additional revenue? Most likely. And I think that we can go further if we find some skin in the game, some obligation on the State's part.
4078	Nielsen	Jim	68	SwF1WjZp4L4	822	832	I'm not being argumentative, but can we really anticipate that many Californians will want to get out of the car? I mean won't that take generations if we're going to get to that ever? I don't know.
4079	Roth	Richard	106	9_Ipr5dyo2o	1714	1745	neutral in terms of the financial impact. But it's my understanding that none are adversely impacted and some are positively impacted. So on the issue of transparency, I say there's been plenty of transparency. On the issue of opportunity to discuss, opportunity to criticize, opportunity to question, and opportunity to hear from the public, I say there's been plenty of that. So having said all of that, I respectfully urge you to vote aye on this measure.
4080	Bonilla	Susan	3	iZciv2kSkT8	829	857	I have a few questions and one is that it seems like were creating something that maybe could just go on and on forever, which is what we tend to do and I'm wondering if one of the suggestions on page three was the CPUC suggests that to manage these risks, there must be continuous evaluation, decide whether to maintain course, alter direction or abandon the effort.
4081	Harper	Matthew	14	tJoPe6FpmUg	1704	1717	And, in fact, looks like the only one that gets cited is about 40 years ago, there was an explosion of a train that was carrying munitions to soldiers in the Vietnam War. Are there any examples of exploding trains the last ten years in California?
4082	Hueso	Ben	48	j_YjnTPR-gU	1710	1723	That we incorporated 2018 timeframe effective date, implementation date. Okay, we'll go to the author and ask him about that in just a second. Did Senator Hertzberg wanna add to that?
4083	Calderon	Ian Charles	115	VixXoFAwUIs	864	879	Thank you Mr Chairman and Committee members. Mr. Maienschein thank you for your comments as well as Thurmond thank you for your and I want to Thank you as a Chair of Budget Sub I budget for your support in this issue and I know that we've had a lot of conversations but your a true champion. We're so glad to have you here with us in Legislature but also chairing Budget Sub 1.
4084	Morrell	Mike	51	NlG9S3jpnwA	1275	1297	Second question, whoever would like to answer this; I want to get back to the underwriting criteria because I think that's important, and I know you can't do, you know, hundred-and-fifty thousand-dollar home type of underwriting. But, does everybody use a debt to income, the ability to repay the loan? You do?
4085	Gallagher	James	108	FMt4j4ajPsQ	1544	1557	Mr. Chairman, members, I know you've had a long committee hearing today, so I'll try to be as brief as possible. I just want to think committee staff for working with my staff, and I think we came to some, some good language on this bill.
4086	Wolk	Lois	94	9Tz8V7yYUic	332	365	And in this particular case, your insistence on your right really could harm my children or my grandchildren. And a lot of other people who through no fault of their own are either babies, immunosuppressed, having treatment for terrible diseases. I really can't support. I am in strong support of this bill.
4087	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	UtqZNbCPgNM	56	67	When firefighters, or any EMS crew picks up someone in an ambulance, a crew is responsible for their care until they are signed over to a hospital emergency department.
4088	Weber	Shirley	44	-absEc_YvaI	1699	1718	And we know that they've been working a while and we still only have two counties in the state after the time of working and negotiating. And whether or not if we put more money in it, it may not necessarily produce the results we want, and then we're still short in terms of beds and trying to get folks into the hospitals or the services they need so they can then develop the competency to go.
4089	Pavley	Fran	104	kvK2sg30nzk	316	337	that have been on the same path, with agency not being interrupted because of philosophical changes on priorities. Maybe it won't always happen that way, so we have to keep that in mind. But I have to say it's really refreshing being in California.
4090	Pavley	Fran	104	kvK2sg30nzk	337	357	We have yet to have, in the 15 years I've been around, any debate on whether climate change is real or not. We can actually talk about it. Not only adaptation but mitigation. And compared to our US Senate, what a different discussion
4091	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	L9_yK97Q24w	79	100	So that's, why we're going to move forward with SB 34 by Senator Hill. And again, we'll start as a subcommittee, and as soon as we get a quorum, we'll establish that. Even if I, if you won't mind if I interrupt, if we're able to do that.
4092	Quirk	Bill	23	Hfoe3X0tet8	1651	1670	AB 33 would require the council to complete its work on a timeframe established in consultation with California Air Resources Board, after allowing for public comments so that council's efforts could be offered as recommendations for including in the Board's next scoping plan.
4093	Fuller	Jean	49	IKESHE_NOXc	380	400	I have a guest with me today, Lieutenant Colonel Wesley Claire. It is with great honor that I introduce Lieutenant Colonel Wesley Claire who is chaplain for the California air national guard, which all of us have sort of an oversight function with
4094	Hertzberg	Robert	99	dElDky5BpW0	57	69	Do you have any data on that? I mean, one of the issues we always get in these situations is cost, cost, cost, we need more money. But the reality is if you don't have to process all these applications, it's a cost-avoidance issue, pretty significant cost-avoidance issue.
4095	Allen	Benjamin	70	JwS_raJ5ApY	623	643	First of all, our Supreme Court in the Prince v. Massachusetts case. The U.S. Supreme Court is sort of the critical case that governs these sorts of questions made it very clear that the state has a right to require vaccinations for attendance in school. That of course has continued right up to the present day.
4096	Wieckowski	Bob	55	E_gAhll2czw	798	834	He served his nation as a fire fighter pilot for 13 years and as a former navy lieutenant commander. Greg served in the navy as an inactive and Reserve capacity for nearly two decades. He was an eagle scout and a male athlete of the year at Western North Carolina. He earned a Bachelor's degree at Weinberg University, a master's degree in biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz, and MBA at USC.
4097	Block	Marty	59	D_2wduB3Bxk	1	36	I will be relatively brief. Key word is relatively. SB 559 adds regular full-time lifeguards employed by Imperial Beach, the City of Imperial Beach to the list of public safety employees entitled to a benefit known is 4850 leave. Under Labor Code section 4850, current law provides a leave of absence of up to one year with full salary and benefits for specified employees who have been injured on-the-job and become disabled or unable to perform their job responsibilities as described in their job description.
4098	Huff	Bob	105	4RPfdYzqQQc	168	184	SB 478 would ammend penal code section 11166 to allow specified mandated reporters to make initial reports of non urgent child abuse or neglect to the child protection agency through a thorough detailed and comprehensive online report.
4099	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	Mfs9_24i5lo	1054	1067	So we're, we're dealing with different economies. But that's the implicit assumption in the law, that all education, all, all employees that work for education entities, local education agencies, are the same.
4100	Bonta	Rob	85	TtbWmbg1NYI	1304	1315	This will save some families thousands of dollars in extra out of pocket expenses, and will protect consumers from having to pay more toward their care merely because they are in a family plan.
4101	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	SCWpb6PxRGE	1680	1701	And perhaps one of the questions we should be asking is whether that building permit should include information. Because if you don't read the building permit, or you ignore it, or you don't comply, you've had notice. You've had knowledge. And before someone comes in, and is impaired and impeded in their access, you will have had notice.
4102	Gatto	Mike	46	oWaFMHsMqpI	420	436	And their information is gonna be on a changeful message sign on the freeway. So and I wanna stress, I think we have taken away all opposition and we have a whole lot of support, and we always have. And most of you voted for this bill last year. I respectfully ask for that vote.
4103	Stone	Jeff	26	Q93W3yN07bU	257	273	I appreciate that. You know, one of our business unfriendly mantras in the State of California is our litigation and pass new laws, you know, certainly open the door for litigation, legitimate and frivolous.
4104	Wolk	Lois	94	MoWOcX9DkpU	1956	1972	I mean it just we can't we can't do business that way. So we have to really get a handle on the estimates that we're making and be able to say and justify them at the time because that's how we make our decisions.
4105	Achadjian	K.H. "Katcho"	5	PPBgSxp7D00	1975	1988	Thank you. Any others? Mr. Chui, I'll share the same concern. I'm going to support you to see it move forward. And hopefully, by the time it gets to the floor, Senate floor, you have to communicate with the League of Cities and hopefully, there is a balance between your decisions.
4106	Galgiani	Cathleen	95	R5jZe-4pYBI	119	137	So the author, you've done a wonderful job. You've come around and talked to me twice and sometimes the author does such a good job on their bills that they're ahead of people who are in our districts that are responding and in this case, while we've talked, I had a late response today from one of my hospitals.
4107	Mitchell	Holly	64	uBO-fu4onZs	694	714	And if you could just talk a little bit about for the record, what we talked about in terms of not only the importance of managing and, and projecting accurately in terms of the the, the security of the investment but, kind of, the source of the funds, how we deal with kind of the front end aspect of that as well.
4108	Moorlach	John	4657	ze-YP1FOzwQ	973	987	I think, colleagues, this is an area we should not be going. We should not be forcing investment decisions in our pension plans. We can certainly give advice, but we shouldn't be doing this. I encourage a no vote, thank you.
4109	Pan	Richard	96	07ilphfHuEw	1139	1151	So let's get to work in getting some funds to actually fix those roads, which is costing each of the taxpayer people use them, most of them taxpayers a lot of money in repairs to cars and other types of the vehicles and other types of things
4110	Pavley	Fran	104	YkUq4Ko6zik	2241	2267	It is a huge backlog and how we can gradually get there. I noticed on the capital outlay project for state parks they're dealing with fish passage, fish passage issue down at Leo Carrillo State Beach along Pacific Coast Highway and they're finally fixing that one.  But it's, anything we can do to help expedite this, that would be good.
4111	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	0LdXFnPqPCk	340	363	The sacrifices of Bloody Sunday cannot be forgotten if we are to be better leaders for our constituents. That which was won in 1965 cannot be lost during our celebrations of history, either by the US Supreme Court or the Congress or state legislators are prejudiced governors or reactionary and backward-looking advocacy groups.
4112	Pan	Richard	96	07ilphfHuEw	1092	1112	So, our state workers are very efficient. We have a big state, our state workers are very efficient and we do have, compared to other states, we have a smaller ratio of state workers compared to most other states. I also want to comment about the engineers and I think one of the...
4113	Gordon	Richard	117	85qNnZBhJlI	590	627	They would do so using the electronic disposal reporting system there's already in place at Cal Recycled. AB 901 would strengthen Cal Recycled fraud enforcement authority by allowing the imposition of civil penalties, penalties against those who falsely or fail to submit timely complete or accurate waste flow information, specifically AB 901 would allow Cal Recycle to impose civil penalties which mirror the civil penalties that they already are allowed to place on the waste tire activities.
4114	Burke	Autumn	6	22umnOjFd7E	921	932	AB 852 will ensure that workers on these publicly subsidized projects are paid a livable wage, and that the most skilled and qualified workers are building these complex medical facilities.
4115	Mullin	Kevin	31	ytuWCZu3NdM	1396	1401	Members, Miss Kim is asking for co-authors this is co-authors on ACR3, the clerk will open the roll. Members this is for co-authors added onto ACR3. All members vote who wish to vote. There are 69 co-authors added to ACR3. Without objection we may take a voice vote on the side, of all those in favor say aye, opposed say nay. The ayes have it. The resolution is adopted. Miss Kim you are recognized at your desk for your guests introductions.
4116	Pavley	Fran	104	cbnLA63gWNQ	1440	1457	Very good, thank you, Senator Wolk, and I would also like to welcome, Senator Nielsen has joined us and member, as a member of the Budget Sub 2 Committee. And what I thought we'd do, if there's no other comments by members, is I think they've organized their selves.
4117	Nguyen	Janet	65	gDPCmEU7pmg	462	481	Right? Am I incorrect? I'm trying to understand this because if you make the statement in your bill that says two individuals from the affected areas will represent the residents in the affected areas. How could someone from the west side know what's gonna be on the east side? That doesn't mean.
4118	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	CW6mZhhMcnU	448	462	So that we don't just say, "Oh well the state will cover it". But I would like to see us very aggressively pursue the polluters once they're identified and be assured that they are going to pay. So that the fund is maintained appropriately.
4119	Dababneh	Matthew	50	22ufHgqGK-A	1000	1008	I would like to point out this survey I think you're coments are very misleading 39% of people said that they would take a taxi if they didn't take an Uber or Lyft.  That would be a form of transportation that I think be considered a car.
4120	Leno	Mark	60	BQgV9eqQ2Tw	117	132	So I want to say this real clearly. This bill does not require any employer to hire any employee he or she does not wish to hire. This bill does not require an employer to provide any benefit he or she does not want to require.
4121	Anderson	Joel	57	zO-5FwV_Tmk	1110	1124	That's wrong. We have an excise tax on cigarettes, it doesn't go to stop people from smoking. It doesn't go to their education, it's used for something else. The idea of an excise tax, is the wrong direction.
4122	Atkins	Toni	110	UDPqIWouyOQ	2298	2312	And I know that some of the school management are uncomfortable with that. They see it as a loss of power, but like it or not, collective bargaining is the only venue we have in our school governance system for joint decision making by employers and employees.
4123	Weber	Shirley	44	wlFflIxZr_U	270	291	I think that I think that there are several of these similar things that may have different names. I know there's one in the San Diego area. I think what these regional occupational centers, how they existed was that different districts pooled their resources to build these centers.
4124	Baker	Catharine	74	LfirS3-TAVM	55	75	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I echo our good colleague's concerns about where the funding is coming from. And that is a funds that although it will go to appropriations and be a fiscal discussion, this is higher ed. And in my local community colleges, they rely and are doing very well with how they're using the SSSP.
4125	Hernandez	Ed	103	GMJQ-TfW0Eo	1536	1557	Okay, we have a lot of problems dealing with vulnerable communities, distribution problem, lack of diversity among our workforce.  We need to make sure that there's a diverse workforce that's culturally sensitive to those particular communities and unique to those particular communities and get more providers in there.
4126	Wieckowski	Bob	55	QmHhObaXRjg	773	795	I have a measure at senior house about climate adaptation as does Mr. Gordon and ours and I'm worried about the discussions regionally, but I understand that it doesn't make sense. So while I think it's an error in having that and we'd like to amend the bill to take that out. So if the local agencies are taxing their people,
4127	Pan	Richard	96	GNC2APr9uoc	1983	1993	Well if you were waiting for a test that is going to decide what your diagnosis is, or your child, how long do you think is acceptable? Isn't six months too long?
4128	Block	Marty	59	HN8BzhqnJIE	693	712	Good on number five. If there are no questions on item number five, we'll move to a vote. We'll vote on each item separately. That's probably the best way to do this. Any public comment on item number five before we vote? Seeing none, pleading to ask staff to read the motion and call the roll.
4129	Dodd	Bill	71	yhT6yC928zE	5	28	Just to follow up on Mr. Wood's comments. You know, clearly ... You know, clearly we have problems here. I... Have you checked, you know, the records to determine what level of negotiations went on with Accenture? I mean, while we have all the problems in the world, you still got a company that made a contract
4130	Pavley	Fran	104	45ZR2HT6sPs	290	309	We've seen them frequently and most recently, we had a hearing on March 10th. I was unable to attend but I participated by listening over the phone. I had a medical emergency at home. But several of you here did attend.
4131	Kim	Young	82	P8Zs2L1mwlY	1405	1426	Efficient in the way you approach us with your arguments about why you need the continued state support and show us that you are doing your share of working on cutting costs here and there, cuz we're all trying to tighten our belts here.
4132	Berryhill	Tom	54	cZiDd6UFemc	1316	1350	Thank you. Is there any other questions? That being said, I just think that it's inspiring because it hasn't always been the case that labor and the tribes that work together and obviously with the support that's here today that's changed. And we've seen that in a couple different compacts that have moved forward this year. So I'd like just to commend all you guys on a fine job. It's a beautiful operation down there.
4133	Leno	Mark	60	cqNpAdWoSFE	1197	1218	24, so I don't know that anyone's making the argument that short of the drought, there's no need for additional assistance for folks who are struggling through the tough times in the economy. (And there has been ten million in federal funds ongoing that's available for the entire state.)
4134	Levine	Marc	8	9IBeZ-9CMcA	132	142	We are working with the HOAs on that. We have the bill in mock up form for the amendments to resolve that concern. And so, we're continuing to work with all the stakeholders.
4135	Mitchell	Holly	64	ISFND_-5pCw	657	668	So I appreciate you not wanting to make proclamations about what you're gonna do, but to give some sense of direction, so people can understand that there is a commitment to AC change.
4136	Wolk	Lois	94	BifOW5Vhe4Q	199	215	Unlike the movie tax credit which will get to lots of people who won't use it or don't even need it, and it's extremely ineffective as all that we did last year for multimillions of dollars.
4137	Leyva	Connie	62	QRS30WyiTXk	380	394	I had questions earlier in another committee on this bill. So are there a lot of people who want to buy a Tesla and don't want it trucked in, they want to fly to California and buy it and drive it home?
4138	Runner	Sharon	4656	MPEe2Ccro74	1968	1988	Thank you, Madame President and members. I rise, once again, to ask for your no vote on this bill. It would basically allow our children, and I say children and I mean eighteen-year-olds, to actually use this way to commit suicide.
4139	Stone	Jeff	26	H96qDKzw-Aw	1814	1835	Good morning, Mr. Chairman, fellow colleagues, committee members. SB 666 is really a very simple measure. California law clearly states that a person who has been previously convicted of a felony and has been confined in the state, in a prison in the state of California cannot enter the grounds of any prison, prison camp or jail in the state.
4140	Nielsen	Jim	68	rD0VjcELenc	1949	1985	Rae was raised in a small farm and she grew up during The Depression, worked at a soda fountain as a young girl. Turning her money over to the family to support her own family. In high school, she met Bernie Richter, who came to be her husband. They had three very prominent businesses up in Chico, where they settled. She was an instrumental part
4141	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	QZvfELCftBU	1035	1052	If we want to have a conversation later on once we have set basic parameters, I would welcome that, and I'm sure it's something. Because privacy in California as you know, Assemblymember Wagner, is a fundamental right here in the state. We value our privacy.
4142	Bloom	Richard	2	t0t13B_zyEs	1078	1099	In the end polluted waters only come back to harm us. When a source of environmental pollution is clearly identified, as plastic microbeads have been, it is critical that we act swiftly before the problem becomes more costly to both our pocketbooks and the environment. We have the opportunity to do that with this bill.
4143	Mullin	Kevin	31	KQICDVGfqPQ	638	661	Business on a daily file there, is no business on the daily file. Moving to announcements, pardon me, moving to a adjournments and memory. Request to adjourn memory the following members were granted prior permission to speak on a adjourn in memory. Members, please direct your attention to Miss Grove. Miss Grove you are recognized for your adjournment in memory.
4144	Brown	Cheryl	13	y0sIqVkPves	116	129	We are in for a silver's salami and whenever we talk about a silver tsunami, there are no big I's and little U's. Everyone is going to turn gray or have a good bottle of die.
4145	Hertzberg	Robert	99	KvteTWNshTw	768	790	Again, Senator, for clarification, that threshold, that $50,000, top two contributors of who have contributed at least $50,000. That's to the Committee that put out the mailer, not necessarily for the mailer itself. So even if the mailer only cost $10,000, but that Committee received contributions of at least $50,000 from two sources. They would still have to list those two.
4146	Patterson	Jim	119	GL6n7Ol5uP8	277	295	I want to give full opportunity to inform me and other members here of the flux of what is happening. So I am gonna just use my last few moments to ask if the utilities want to do some kind of a response to the question about the cost shift and make your basic case.
4147	Mitchell	Holly	64	XFSLCFM97Og	1723	1741	But recognizing the skill set you bring on the back office, I think, is critical to the department's effort to continue to work within what will ultimately become a shrinking budget, as fewer and fewer people are sent to CDCR facilities.
4148	Leyva	Connie	62	8ENPCPUYlKU	1155	1170	Thank you, Madame President. I just wanted to rise and thank the author very much for bringing this bill forward. I had the opportunity to take the toxic tour in my district, and I was dismayed by what I saw there.
4149	Chavez	Rocky	83	CRMwg6_WO3E	1611	1632	Members, as we look across the state, you know, there's a lot of discussion on water, but clearly energy is something that we need to get in front of. As I've said many times publicly, I actually believe that we have a serious issue with climate change and we need to look at how we provide energy and resources.
4150	Hernandez	Ed	103	lVI-Q1bHrK4	89	101	Currently has seven, enough to get out. We'll place that bill on call. We're gonna move on to item number seven, AB 521, Nazarian, HIV testing. Good afternoon, Assemblymember.
4151	Weber	Shirley	44	qIsKWbokTQE	1508	1522	We will keep you informed of the amendments as it moves through the process. This bill has been supported by the Vietnam Veterans of California, the Disabled Veterans Business Alliance, the Military Officers Association of America, and the American Legions and AMVETS.
4152	Thurmond	Tony	4	q7LT4HnI37Y	1008	1026	Got it, and you did talk about, you had a number of stakeholder conversations, thank you for that. I did want to understand, does that includes nurses and other staff who work directly with the patients, who see things that might be useful to strengthening the reporting process?
4153	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	U75LWC7ksak	75	97	So, I'm familiar with adult education, teaching it, but also in the classroom I know that we used it as credit-recovery for some of our high school students, so certainly a necessary venture. And I always say that adult education teachers make America work because they teach language skills, they teach parenting skills, they teach citizenship skills, and a variety of other employment skills.
4154	Waldron	Marie	29	OACKM5KF8Sk	400	420	Thank you Mr. Chair. Just quickly on the data regarding the reimbursement rates that you did the analysis, on the selected states. I notice that Washington is broken out. It has children up to age 5 and then an overall. Is that because they do a different reimbursement rate for younger or ...
4155	Hernandez	Ed	103	tf_1MHXwKaY	1419	1442	Thank you. Anyone else in opposition? Okay. We're going to bring it to the members. Any questions or comments? Senator Mitchell, and then, I think Roth, then Pan, then Monning. Nielsen, did you go first? All right, we'll get everybody.
4156	Thurmond	Tony	4	DqvTWVgFqyQ	1129	1162	To me it magnifies the statements that you're making about how hard it is to find a provider. What do you do when you're hospital goes away? And the county can't take it over. What are your thoughts about our public hospitals? If they close, we won't be doing any prevention or I will be doing stop gap measures that have to be costly inexpensive. What thoughts do you have that you want to share about these, our public entities or even private hospitals that are serving largely public folks?
4157	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	xZgWg023k_I	446	457	We have a number of proposals that'll be heard in both of our committees that will begin advancing that conversation and we love to here from stake holders and advocates that are in this room and outside of this physical space
4158	Hueso	Ben	48	mZDplXo566U	1507	1514	And thank you very much for being here today and thanks to the public. We're going to go to public comment now and we'll hear some comment from them.
4159	Mitchell	Holly	64	MTWW-DN4Tdo	718	733	Item two Medi-Cal. Skilled Nursing Facility Quality Assurance Fee Extension. The recommendation is to adopt placeholder trailer bill language as noticed on page five of the agenda. That's out with a two to one recommendation.
4160	Pavley	Fran	104	VxnkQM8e4Ho	746	765	I'm not discouraging the fix it first, given all our priority lists but maybe there is an opportunity to also move things forward, connecting with the goals of getting people out of their cars or other strategies that could allow for expenditures of cap and trade dollars.
4161	Hueso	Ben	48	20R5DjZ86C8	680	695	What Ex Parte Rules do you have? When you meet with PUC Commissioners, do you have to disclose the contents of those meetings? Is there a requirement to when people meet with you? Do you have an Ex Parte Rule?
4162	Leno	Mark	60	KRvT4-vnFFc	1709	1719	So it's been a good working relationship. I know there's a lot more to talk about, specifically with regard to the language itself. But otherwise, I think we're moving in the right direction.
4163	Wood	Jim	72	cflx69hA7mw	55	68	And I have several examples from my district of the process taking longer than a year. The department's process has become so burdensome that several cities in my district have quit applying for the grants altogether.
4164	Hueso	Ben	48	LVzFkfmZq9U	1263	1286	That number means something only to the federal government. Those archives have never been breached, they're very well-protected, and so there really is no concern that if I'm walking around with this around the neighborhood and somebody happens to have. a, you know, you know, emits a signal to pick up and steal my identity.
4165	Olsen	Kristin	15	ITEaoTWbk6c	1112	1130	Those of us who have served in local government know that in order to approve a housing project, you have to be able to certify a twenty-year water supply. If we don't start to address this water crisis in California, we're not going to be able to make those certifications and we're going to exacerbate the housing crisis that we already have.
4166	Leno	Mark	60	SK-C_51Liio	1314	1337	Also one of San Francisco's major benefactors and philanthropists having donated over 300 million dollars of his money to a new hospital. He said in an interview last January with regard to intractable problems facing and challenging San Francisco, Marc Benioff said quote, "The first thing is
4167	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	yhx1NvxzAgA	1930	1941	Which is a significant extension. I can't think of that many areas where we have a ten year statute. That is quite broad and for the reasons that you've mentioned. So, which again-
4168	Williams	Das	12	DaiegGG5yrM	594	615	And if we don't do a good job of tackling climate change, it will be the poor, not only in places like the Philippines and Bangladesh, who already are suffering from the effects of climate change, but in places like Florida and California, that suffer the most.
4169	Thurmond	Tony	4	5kU8DLIkLSI	1729	1749	As you probably know, they're significantly understaffed for their population and don't have the dollars to do it, so it is still a funding issue and a need for funding. And so I do think that there's an opportunity here in addition to the $40 million to look at ways to support departments locally.
4170	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	AXQlG4R7h08	1702	1720	Thank you. I think that clarifies it. I think what you're doing is you are kind of looking at the whole process. This is just taking what exists and just expanding it. Probably a good idea at some point if we take a look at the whole foster care system. But that's not what your bill does so understand that this is a very small piece of it.
4171	Thurmond	Tony	4	exSo7zlduuA	657	676	Items on call with one vote, other members can add on as they arrive. Thank you. Wanna ask the Department of Healthcare Services if you would come forward, please?
4172	Wagner	Donald	88	rOcxPrNyERc	703	725	It's time to say stop. It's time to give our employers breathing room so that they can grow themselves and provide the further jobs and the further opportunities that at the end of the day don't benefit the employers, but actually benefit the employees by giving them good productive jobs.
4173	Hancock	Loni	98	a6D1KFF96cc	248	274	I wanna really thank the committee staff in working with my staff, and the sponsors in crafting this to be a very narrow bill. And it will essentially clarify current law relating to who is authorized to obtain a protective order on behalf of an elder or a dependent adult.
4174	Bloom	Richard	2	nmXPXxV6MnM	1144	1169	This is what I'm hearing, it's language of confrontation and not solution. And I really think that if this is an issue that even has a solution, we ought to be trying to define what those solutions are, seek them out and work on them. Thank you.
4175	Wood	Jim	72	h3qpDny4S5o	262	279	But the actual response says that in quote-unquote this requirement is not part of the required reporting process and that was the reason for not doing it so has something changed because that response doesn't match with your response.
4176	Huff	Bob	105	BvEiMZK1K8A	2251	2275	Many of us have had such losses in our lives and we can empathize, but it's never quite the same. Michael certainly inspires us every day with this positive words comments, "how's it going? Well has its ups and downs, you know."
4177	Bonilla	Susan	3	54O2UbeLCuE	111	123	We are hoping that CDE would probably use children to perhaps design the decal that would be on the plate, and that we would involve the school children in our state in this effort as well.
4178	Hueso	Ben	48	Idhs0np0fh0	1651	1682	I'll be taking them up in the next committee. Okay very good, so that's a yes, and I think that, that gets to some of the arguments that this requirement is owners. I think they do take up fishes before the PUC, it can all get ironed out there and, this will create a scenario in which they need to address the practices with regards internally, in hiring.
4179	Quirk	Bill	23	tEhMYBdIqkE	1460	1484	Sure, but there's sort of 90 under 236 and roughly 140 under 143 under 266. So 90 as human trafficking 243 under 266 pimping and pandering of which 61 are for minors.
4180	Bigelow	Frank	91	E5Lv9C_D3vg	133	150	So we'll try to get through this as expeditiously as possible, and again to our Chairman who has definitely given us a tremendous amount of effort in making sure that this all goes smoothly. I wanna thank him, because he put a lot of time and personal attention into this himself.
4181	Hueso	Ben	48	bpX2DHA925w	167	187	The public is looking to the CPUC, the government agency responsible for ensuring safe utility service and today we will hear from the CPUC president Michael Picker who will share the goals and plans of the commission to better address safety and leadership.
4182	Mitchell	Holly	64	MTWW-DN4Tdo	693	716	Moving on to Department of Health Care Services on page five of the agenda. Item one, again Medi-Cal. The impact of the president's executive order. The recommendation is approval of the May revised numbers. Again, that's approval of the May revised numbers. That's out with a two to one recommendation.
4183	Mitchell	Holly	64	dmdc2oNqHGQ	56	74	And, each agenda there's a vote-only calendar as well as items for discussion. We will only take public comment for items under discussion. At this time we're gonna take one item out of order for our two colleagues in the Senate, Senators Hueso and Pan.
4184	Quirk	Bill	23	dJ6Is8ZeyoY	327	342	So why don't we go for about three minutes each, given that we have only six or seven, and we've got about 30 minutes to go, so we will hear from Mr. Eloy Garcia.
4185	Hertzberg	Robert	99	XG9g8L3IwGU	1305	1325	The question is in terms of that issue of are we, in your judgment as an expert on this, are we, given the language of this, giving up the right to control, as long as this controls, are we giving up the right to control the Amazon types of the world to engage in commercial activity because that's how I read it.
4186	Block	Marty	59	A1UTGLmNv2E	2053	2058	Thank you, Madame President. It gives me great pleasure to present Senate concurrent resolution 17 this morning, which honors the 100th anniversary of the United States Navy Reserve. For a century, brave men and women have served their country as citizens sailors.
4187	Stone	Jeff	26	-zapzAXTnLg	354	373	ensure that they would not be sleeping on the streets, that they had food to eat, and they had medical care. I regret to inform you that the Obama administration refused to allow our county hospital on wheels to provide this intervention for these
4188	Mendoza	Tony	52	bsC6VSsjVLI	1336	1344	Thank you Mr. Quirk for bringing this bill forward. I would like to be added as its co-author certainly know the incident that occurred at the Farrell's Ice Cream.
4189	Stone	Jeff	26	-zapzAXTnLg	392	410	American dream, they want a better future for their children and grandchildren, and I believe that we all stand united in that process. We need Congress and the President to work together to come up with a comprehensive plan that everyone can buy into. And if the federal government is going to grant any type of amnesty programs,
4190	Mendoza	Tony	52	bsC6VSsjVLI	1344	1363	Obviously happened to one of my constituents, happened in my district, happened to our local councilman who's mother-in-law passed away because of that accident where a car just stepped on the gas and went right through the parlor, and killed her. That was a very unfortunate incident that occurred, I believe, it was last year.
4191	Stone	Jeff	26	-zapzAXTnLg	429	462	on the edge, just climbing out of this economic debacle to provide services for those that are legally here already. So Mr President, I again commend Senator Vidak for SJR 2. I think it's important we stand united as the State Senate and encouraging the President to work with the Congress comprehensively and let's put the political rhetoric aside and let's pass some humanitarian legislation that gives people the
4192	Berryhill	Tom	54	cvDmVx__4xs	91	113	To address the concerns of the Department of Finance, we had a good meeting with them the other day. I'm willing to take an amendment which would change the date that the department would be required to adjust the fuel excise tax rate from March 1st to May 15th. And as you mentioned, we are very lucky to have the esteemed Fiona Ma here with us today to answer any questions that you might have.
4193	Pavley	Fran	104	Ab32yuFXwvM	1156	1178	So, I have a great deal of concern on how we move forward. I will be supporting the staff recommendations which are thoughtful. I don't think this committee has to choose between that energy policy verse not protecting, I think, our most important natural resource, and that's water, especially in the four year of record drought.
4194	Nielsen	Jim	68	xrb7OkoktfM	1825	1855	Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to rise as well. To acknowledge Peter Chacon. I had the privilege of serving with this man. The other day, when I read in the paper of his passing at 82, the thought crossed my mind, how young. A man who deserved to serve his human kind a lot longer than 82 years. Here in the Legislature Peter
4195	Anderson	Joel	57	Fotikfq9Ybo	1800	1811	I would thing the injury, too, would be from it hitting somebody as opposed to a helicopter crashing or, I mean, there's no bodies onboard so you wouldn't have that worry.
4196	Garcia	Eduardo	38	zOcsFgJ-ERA	1020	1038	Yeah, thank you, Chairman. And thank you Assembly Member Baker for bringing forward those amendments to add some additional safeguards. A question for our faith based leader, I've been struggling with this issue quite a bit.
4197	Obernolte	Jay	86	79bMZ-eNloc	733	756	All right, I understand. I'm not trying to be difficult, but I just want to understand where the number, the $10,000 for the first violation comes from. So can you come up with a hypothetical situation where you think a $10,000 penalty for the first violation would be warranted? Can you?
4198	Leno	Mark	60	EP8eVPLyUZg	118	141	So for both reasons, I think it's important and it's no hardship to the manufacturers, as was already mentioned in the earlier testimony by Aaron. That for ten, how many years did you say? 36 years? 39 years before they redeemed to be non fibrous products. They had to comply with TB 117. They had to label.
4199	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	TgDKGcmi03Q	144	167	Not only did we just witness the huge tragedy of the crash in Philadelphia, on the East Coast. And the deaths of at least seven people and the injury of 200 more, which is an appalling accident. Being actually from the East Coast myself, I know how significant that rail line is.
4200	Chavez	Rocky	83	aa6v0aO1V2M	1035	1053	So, we're trying to give it down and let them do it. So everybody has changed their roles. Like our responsibility, that's why I was talking to Mr. Brooks on this, at our level what we're looking at is we want to see California move up in its academic performance. That's our metric.
4201	Nielsen	Jim	68	bG49iSrqac0	959	987	Madame President, the purpose of the introduction. May I introduce to the Senate, Katie Martin. Katie Martin has gone through elementary school, high school, and college with our three sons. She's a regular visitor in our house, has wonderful conversations of highly intellectual and she's interested in government and she's here today following us around. She couldn't have come at a better day for honoring women.
4202	Leno	Mark	60	LFikd5rYakY	1720	1742	Also it increases the amount available for counties to recruit, retain, and support foster care parents and relative caregivers and lastly, it provides ongoing funding for the operations at the Leland-Stanford museum. I ask for your aye vote.
4203	Hancock	Loni	98	QoWDHxezaEY	524	543	Thank you, and I just wanted to add that I've actually talked with the Assembly Public Safety Chair, and we are both interested in doing a whole hearing on the finds and the add-ons of what it means for the courts and the individuals involved.
4204	Quirk	Bill	23	fjQhThyumBs	1433	1463	For example, if we were to have 8 million vehicles, we would, I believe need to take a large part of the cap and trade monies and use it to subsidize the purchases of electric vehicles and the deployment of a system to charge them for daytime in particular, cuz no one's gonna wanna wait an hour or two in the middle of the day to charge their car. So we're gonna need to have them all over the place in virtually every place you can park.
4205	Alejo	Luis	9	r1PhXBRe6ug	1547	1566	He flew 35 successful missions over Germany, survived a crash landing, and was honorably discharged as you war hero. With that GI bill he went on to pursue his educational dreams and was able to graduate from San Diego State University with a BA in education and his master's in school administration.
4206	Gordon	Richard	117	85qNnZBhJlI	627	641	The authority to have civil penalties imposed is needed because according to Cal Recycle two-thirds of the current reports are late incomplete or inaccurate, again timely and accurate reports are needed if we're achieve our goal of seventy five percent recycling.
4207	Hancock	Loni	98	r722a4Ml8Ec	233	262	Thank you very much, Senator Leno. Just an observation on the previous topic, very general. We are the richest state in the richest country in the world. And austerity is a choice not a necessity in my view. And we make choices based on how we see the greatest good for the people of California.
4208	Williams	Das	12	Ai7oaVN8l2E	530	547	And, you know, to me it sounds a little incredulous that we will lead ourselves to believe that we will ever have enough water to tolerate people illegally diverting water that belongs to someone else.
4209	Leno	Mark	60	gvsFAuMIegs	1469	1489	And so with that experience with the budget process, where should their hope be through the special session? What I can ask right now is to have faith. I have to have faith as a legislator because I've been let down and I've been disappointed. I've got to believe that there will be political will.
4210	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	3Q-Ppkm2Its	250	262	I don't know that necessarily there's a statewide problem. I'm a realist. I taught high school. I left there in December. Kids get pregnant. It's the most unfortunate thing I see at a high school level. Too many do.
4211	Garcia	Eduardo	38	ullCtaxzBRw	0	12	On top of that director Ja I know that there's a number of conversations along the same lines occurring. One in particular that I recently read about what which has to do the H1 visas.
4212	Campos	Nora	76	Zewkjo1Xkzc	1314	1338	We will know whether the Supreme Court or whatever court looks at this. They will look at it in a different manner than the lens that I'm looking at it. And maybe, the lens that you're looking at it. And maybe, we will get the result that we want. But if we don't attempt this, then I think we are doing a disservice to not only the Avila family, but I think to families throughout the State of California.
4213	Leyva	Connie	62	GE9yKeDoFKQ	83	103	Some of you may be familiar with a procedure called flushing. That's where the water faucet is turned on for about 30 seconds and that is supposed to flush the lead from the pipes. I personally know that I wouldn't feel comfortable having my children drinking that water and I don't think anyone would.
4214	Weber	Shirley	44	gf6xiaI75uY	2131	2149	So I'm trying to figure out how you found it out if the audit didn't review. I mean, you know? It bothers me the language is disconcerting. I, you know, and I don't know if we need to have that much language about fraud, waste, and abuse. Unless we really do, and if we do, then my question is then who's supposed to be in charge,
4215	Mitchell	Holly	64	hlpilfylTQI	1344	1356	And so this additional Placeholder Trailer Bill Language that directs administration work with staff on some of the specifics referenced on the top of page 27 is what will make the recommendation.
4216	Dahle	Brian	47	4jcAwL2kOMo	135	151	we need to work together with the workers and good businesses to make the field level and we definitely need to make sure that if people are being employed, that they are paid correctly, and they get their rights, the things that are owed to them. Yes.
4217	Hertzberg	Robert	99	898OiW72jWg	43	70	I wanna address the approach you've taken in legislation, Senator Moorlach. Because, as we all lawyers say, it assumes facts not evidence. It works off a premise, an appropriate premise, that the cost to government for services should be as reasonable as possible, right? And there's a lot of determination to what that means.
4218	Stone	Mark	20	4Kyw8qlYrTk	21	40	But also in California has long had a strong history of protecting employee rights, and the Hosanna decision affects really both of those. This is a hearing to explore the topic, understand some of the issues and the sensitivities that have been created with the Hosanna decision.
4219	McCarty	Kevin	22	6jHkP5bxQA4	1016	1079	Okay, thank you, any more questions for this panel? Just so you know all these pieces, it's a very robust agenda today, and they're all kind of pieces of the puzzle, they're all on our list and none of these are unreasonable asks. We're certainly considering them as we go forward to the May revise, I guess, again. Now the big picture is that these things, these investments are a huge return on investment. We have Nobel Laureate economists, business leaders, to people in the military, to bi-partisan leaders saying that bang for bang the biggest investment you can make and return on your dollar is early education so we're focusing on all of these. And we do know, I think, I didn't mention this on the last panel, but I think it's important not to get lost on when you focus in on the subsidized rates for low income families. It has an impact on centers overall, and so these are paying customers and so many times we've seen that the state was wrong, it has a big impact, as we saw the numbers overall of licensed centers and providers in California. And so we know they all play together.
4220	Beall	Jim	92	nrJtkVtsuec	1465	1472	And it would help 'em get finished quicker. And why do an EIR for each one of those projects? Why do a separate engineering contract for each one of those projects?
4221	Beall	Jim	92	JKPJXBAVEPo	1240	1261	Okay. That's 10- 0 will place it on call, for absent members. Thank you. Thank you, committee members. We'll be waiting on other Senators to vote and then adjourn the meeting. Thank you. Yeah, I think...
4222	Gallagher	James	108	ch3qK2_FbyA	731	750	We need to be very thoughtful about how we move forward, because this could cost us jobs, and inhibit us bringing people out of poverty. I think the bottom line is right now we have more people living in poverty, we have more people looking for jobs and not only that, their cost-of-living is
4223	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	UpjsW9YiW28	537	558	I was shocked to learn that organic is only 95% organic. I want to know what's that other 5% in that organic fruit that I'm paying a lot more for, but I'm doing that by choice. If I knew, that it was being called organic but it was only 51% organic, I may not buy it, so part of the problem is, what is the percentage.
4224	Gallagher	James	108	ch3qK2_FbyA	750	768	becoming higher because of these policies. Their energy is going up they're paying more at the gas pump. They're paying more for their food prices, all as a result of these policies. So, we need to be very thoughtful of the cost of continuing to extend this program and I would urge a no vote. Thank you.
4225	McGuire	Mike	93	MCkdJZZjTXo	1577	1619	And then as we see, it's inconsistent level of mental health services. Throughout, particularly in the group home system, which I know you're very focused on the continued care. And I say all this because this is going to take additional funding. And we're spending nearly a quarter $1 billion on psychotropic drugs now through Medicaid, and I think 72% of that is on foster youth, can we look at additional investments? Because that's what it's gonna take, right? Is additional investment to better provide additional wraparound service.
4226	Leno	Mark	60	vpNS8YXwTNY	1291	1317	There's nothing minor about it. And so it will impact many industries and many organizations in many ways. And I want to be respectful of all of the voices that were here today and the concerns expressed. At the same time I'm going to attempt to respond to some of the lowest hanging fruit and let Mr Lippert get some of the higher ones.
4227	Gray	Adam	27	-9yM4LrfOs0	386	412	Mr. Chair, you raised the issue in respect to consistency, well I would certainly suggest that it's not consistent, that the DOJ does not release this information that have registered firearms but only for concealed weapon permits. So the extent to which you and you raised the right of a neighbor to have some understanding of whether their neighbors own or possess firearms, well they don't have that ability.
4228	Dababneh	Matthew	50	TmtzANXYgv0	102	130	I heard several times you talked about how this will undermine the law. I heard several times that this will make consumers less protected. I didn't hear any specifics. Could you address under your first scenario that the gentleman who represents the consumer advocates, how would the scenario that you told us about the gentleman whose steering column, or I forgot the exact situation, his car malfunctioned. How would this current law have made his situation worst?
4229	Waldron	Marie	29	ospSq9hYks4	216	236	Thank you Mr Chair. Just briefly to Miss Kenney, as a mom, you know, it breaks my heart to hear of, you know, parents trying to get their kids in who seriously have an issue, and they can't be seen, and I would say, you know, you've probably see that more often than not.
4230	Weber	Shirley	44	toyLEHK5bMU	2004	2023	No it has not. But the commitment to continue the work is there and at least it takes the first step. Some of you say why rush, why do it now? I think my colleague from San Bernadino has told us that come January one and our speaker has also, that they'll be a fire sale based on the agreements out there. So many of your cities will even lose
4231	McGuire	Mike	93	JX8xAEiw8s4	849	865	Anna Johnson is a policy analyst from the National Center for Youth Law. And Mrs. Johnson is going to kick us off and then I'll invite Mr. Stewart after Mrs. Johnson's four minutes. And again, we want to say thank you to the four of you for being here today. Mrs. Johnson, the floor is yours.
4232	Hill	Jerry	66	WbtRyMk2fD8	30	50	The consent calendar has eight votes. We will hold that. Oh? We'll hold the roll open for the absent members there. We'll move now to item number five, AB 316. Good afternoon, Assemblymember Maienschein. Nice to see you. Very good.
4233	Bonta	Rob	85	rLEgt6RVkfo	73	102	First, drug formularies should cover medically necessary drugs. Without discriminating against those with conditions like HIV/AIDS, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy or other serious conditions. Second, consumers should not be discouraged from taking medically necessary drugs by cost sharing of more than $6,000 for a single drug. The important consumer protections in AB 339 include a cap on prescription drug co-pays and coinsurance of no more than $250 for most coverage, and $500 for bronze.
4234	Leno	Mark	60	xOTz1OskesQ	720	737	Again, because the size of our market they just had one standard. It was to meet TB 117. Now of course with TB 117-2013, our fire safety standard can be complied with or without chemicals and it's up to the manufacturers to decide that themselves.
4235	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	E7Xx3wrypds	1232	1250	But I think everyone has said we need a dedicated funding stream over and above that. I don't know if that will fall on deaf ears. But certainly, there is federal money or there theoretically should be. There's state money we've heard talk about, regional. If we get more people on the trains, the farebox can be very significant.
4236	Gomez	Jimmy	80	JgpqDSrKaXw	1815	1832	AB 1143, Hadley, require FTB to provide voter registration cards to taxpayers who have moved, hold in committee. AB 1164, Gatto, reporting on conditions of the state highway system, do pass. A roll call. AB 1172, child establish State Cyber Security Task Force, do pass. A roll call.
4237	Dodd	Bill	71	UOAgtw9idpM	118	138	with other studies that have been done showing increased economic activity following national monument designation. AJR 4 requests Secretary of Interior to respect existing land uses, respect private property in the area and consult local representatives. More than
4238	Cooley	Ken	45	51wXJ30ZLf4	1578	1600	Mr. Chair and member of the senate health committee, pleasure to be here on behalf of AB 266. This bill takes the approach of an over arching lead agency coordinating with other states agencies, in which we have invested tax dollars to grow expertise that will support this enterprise.
4239	Dababneh	Matthew	50	-R4HGT4UbOs	980	995	Colleagues, today I rise to adjourn to memory Rick Orlav, a veteran Los Angeles daily news reporter who covered local politics in Los Angeles for nearly 30 years. If you follow politics in Southern California then you know you read Rick Orlav's articles.
4240	Gatto	Mike	46	22ufHgqGK-A	11	31	Good afternoon everybody this is the April 21, 2015 hearing of the Assembly Committee on consumer protection and privacy I'm sorry May 5th, clearly we need a new Chair, all right we we're going to take a moment and establish a quorum.
4241	Bonilla	Susan	3	qzvpjn8Cr2Y	674	693	Two years ago when we heard the bill, we talked a lot about the fact that in an integrated setting, nurse practitioners are functioning very, very well independently of supervision. And I think that we are moving with ACA towards very patient, focused, integrated models.
4242	Hertzberg	Robert	99	CKAXbjP6mGQ	1240	1251	So let me tell you, what I see is that by domesticating energy we produce high-wage jobs in California. Is it going to be difficult? Are there going to be transitions from the old model to the new? Yes!
4243	Mitchell	Holly	64	ofo4g2uUHBA	209	235	I would hope that there would be some way that you could consistently report to the legislature these numbers, the findings, what's taken action, just so we are forever current in our understanding of the actions the state agency has taken as we read press inquiries, as we get calls from constituents, as we hear from the advocacy community.
4244	McGuire	Mike	93	_I82MBaJ6Dg	322	337	So, can you talk about, Mr. Lightbourne, how that's going to be rolled out in timeline because I frankly think that it's necessary for success for families, particularly women and kids.
4245	Moorlach	John	4657	R0xKhCYzBZA	771	796	You would reduce your wall of debt by $50 billion here at the state. And what I'm seeing in this bill doesn't give the Governor enough tools, doesn't do what needs to be done like we did in Orange County. I extend my offer to hep the Governor. Or if you want to go through our plan and what we've done, I'm happy to jump in and assist.
4246	Gatto	Mike	46	UdyJhNk-vh8	737	757	But a drone, it could be up there 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and really when we start talking about that, when you take out the need for a human pilot with all of our weaknesses as humans. You really get into a world where it's a complete surveillance state, whether or not there's a expectation of privacy or not.
4247	Allen	Benjamin	70	acGD7CpLfyI	48	64	In November, in LA County it was 38 percent of our voters, in Humboldt County, the next lowest percentage was 57 percent in Humboldt County. That's the next lowest percent of mail ballots so...
4248	Beall	Jim	92	7wM-SWUAGJQ	564	582	And many of these students face multiple barriers and early education is critical and my district intends to demonstrate the effectiveness of early learning and community engagement. This bill would effectively create an all day program for the preschool program there at no cost to the State of California.
4249	McGuire	Mike	93	zWP9Ch_UvEs	749	766	Now, I couldn't agree more with this statement and this message may sound familiar to these committee members because it's the same message that Airbnb hosts sent to members of this committee, and I think it is appropriate to be able to start out by saying amen.
4250	Stone	Jeff	26	Ga_QNYq_wVM	1956	1971	And I think that the Senator remember that when we were running for his present Senate seat that he has, there was this terrible, terrible crime that we all will remember involving a gentleman by the name of John Gardner.
4251	Gatto	Mike	46	0BI7ZwRm0UU	1968	1976	We will go over the privacy and consumer protection issues as well, but we're gonna go into the hallway for five minutes, we'll be right back. Thank you. Members, do not go anywhere.
4252	Thurmond	Tony	4	merVIEmEWtA	806	826	I'm honored that our colleague, Assembly Member Stone is here who has been giving great thought to this very conversation. Our strategies for how to help our California families get out of poverty. We'd like to have him come forward at this time to give us a few words about his thoughts on how we might move forward. Welcome Assembly Member Stone.
4253	Dodd	Bill	71	XBK8TgfRp6Y	1107	1120	So we at the state do have those tools available to us. And I just think that it's communication. We're going to get far more done in this area by using the tools that are just simple. And getting the word out there.
4254	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	E51em1yWGKw	86	117	What would you recommend from your perspective as the best way to... I won't say restore, that implies that there's something wrong with the process. But to make the fundamental goals of CEQA more easily attainable, what would you recommend as a way that we could either procedurally or substantively so that we can maintain the fundamental principles of CEQA while bringing it perhaps into a more modern context?
4255	Frazier	Jim	114	dAMeavSqnLk	68	90	Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members. Assembly Bill 1323 creates an expedited process for agencies to remove marine debris, which is defined as a vessel or part of a vessel that is unseaworthy and not reasonably fit as a means of transportation by water. The Senate amendments are technical and clarifying and made it a much better bill. Thank you, and I respectfully ask for an aye vote.
4256	Nielsen	Jim	68	jAn9ObwSR14	401	417	Don't trouble with it. Is it a substantial percent, or just a little tiny bit, mostly fee funded fines? That's enough for now. We can dig that up later.
4257	Liu	Carol	63	tIl0bzr-tVs	327	340	The objectives of which are to provide low and middle income housing and preserve neighborhoods. Caltrans is proceeding with the draft regulations governing the sale of the, of the property, but one last issue warrants a legislative remedy.
4258	Wood	Jim	72	Jsr4ST1itp0	221	237	Senator Leno, please go ahead and present. I'm obviously not Mr. Bonta. I'm obviously not Mr. Maienschein, so I'm kind of down the totem pole a little bit, but please go ahead and well, I'm just calling it out, you know. So.
4259	Hill	Jerry	66	EhsW00cBA0A	1902	1924	Thank you and also would certainly appreciate is if this does pass today it will go back to a Committee on rules at the point consider to remove or amend the bill to remove the Department of Consumer Affairs as the lead agency in that and establish a new bureau.
4260	Hancock	Loni	98	TZ3CNB06_OE	1755	1775	Require the prescribing psychiatrist to examine the patient in person and to strike the word of "the other" from the reasons for appointing a non-treating psychiatrist. So is there a motion on the bill?
4261	Patterson	Jim	119	tJoPe6FpmUg	1307	1337	But, we get into a lot of- And I understand your approach here, but even if you incorporate this different or higher standard. Isn't it a fact that the railroads are safer now than they were five years ago? And significantly so. Is that not a demonstrable fact?
4262	Williams	Das	12	LbtPqasrxt4	367	383	Thank you, and of course you would make recommendations for change and allocation in the following fiscal year. Can you at some point give us some of those methods that the state uses to go after grant recipients that don't perform?
4263	Monning	Bill	25	gB0SqdP0x6o	824	837	Thank you Madame Chair for organizing this hearing. Mr. Secretary, thank you for your time and more importantly what you've brought to California over the last four years. It's much appreciated.
4264	Wieckowski	Bob	55	uaZYquORnnU	1504	1523	This committee's in the process of having field hearings on climate adaptation and we'll be going out to the Central Valley and when we were in the Bay Area, we found that it wasn't just the disadvantaged communities that have a need for assistance. Localities and regional folks need technical assistance to do their resiliency plans.
4265	Frazier	Jim	114	Mfs9_24i5lo	1544	1553	And so I'm looking forward to somebody putting in some kind of policy to make sure that the money's used wisely and it's the best, best bang for the buck.
4266	Chau	Ed	116	bgwj3wqmbCQ	1087	1102	Yes, and so, if I understand you correctly, the main opposition came from the recorder themselves, but not so much from other organizations such as the realtors? Did the realtors have any issues with that issue?
4267	Hertzberg	Robert	99	XAJHKAVYVrw	847	855	It is fair to say that this is money that would be going to pay down these student loans for these accounts, versus to the general fund. That is true.
4268	Pan	Richard	96	t4hQNDqgAZU	420	444	But the thing to keep in mind is you should probably first think, well maybe those are all just people who lived in the church, who were in that church and went to those schools, six of the children were attendees of their school, three of them were not, because what happened is, the children and the families didn't just stay in the church, and didn't stay in their school, they went out into the community, and approximately half the cases of the measles were not members of the church who didn't believe in immunizations.
4269	Hueso	Ben	48	jSkO5GUtg1k	719	759	I think that people think of this process and wonder like me, how is it possible? And how is it possible for us to assess whether it's safe, whether we can foresee the consequences of this to the people that have made claims that it effects the tectonic plates, that it can affect the water table, that it effects so many other things, and my question to you, because we got into a little bit of the budget, and when I thought of 50,000 wells, I think how many people do we have to review that number 1, number 2, do we have the resources to adequately assess what's going on in these wells on a daily basis?
4270	Allen	Benjamin	70	uGcU2KdVjhw	2	24	Thank you, Senators. This bill in many ways is very much a companion bill to the last one. These two bills together seek to provide about $600 million additional for transit funding every year. And they, so a lot of the core reasons for the need are here, and I'll talk a little bit about them from my perspective.
4271	Nguyen	Janet	65	jWp79DKV-DI	727	744	through your presiding judge, throughout the years. And so it's more of trying to figure out how we can do this in a collaborative way, that's why they're called collaborative courts to transport these individuals, if they are currently in jail, in an effective efficient way of doing it.
4272	McGuire	Mike	93	GHyOxyKfubI	1103	1125	And once wild forest have been booby trapped, that can cause bodily harm or kill hikers, which we're gonna show in just a bit. Rogue operators have clear cut thousands of acres of forest illegally, both on public and private lands, without regard for the long-term impacts they are creating for neighboring landowners, downstream farms, or endangered species.
4273	Weber	Shirley	44	v8EYhSKM6wc	913	928	Then what I request of you is that you give me the same courtesy you gave last week. Because that bill required testing and this one does not. And you voted to pass that bill to the next committee. I guess in hopes that you could work on it further.
4274	Hadley	David	40	dQgHkZmLQFo	2082	2114	I do take seriously the structural concerns of the first witness in opposition to the bill. But there is actually no question that the abuses that you describe are real. That the delays in construction are real. And that the related impacts on housing affordability and housing availability are very real. And so I don't believe that your bill quite solves those problems.
4275	Dahle	Brian	47	FapiTOGMI3c	962	981	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, I want to just say that I also spent many years on the board of supervisors dealing with, this isn't just about one gold mine in Nevada County, this is about all mines in California and it is very technical. I'm interested in seeing what amendments you do bring with the rural counties.
4276	Thurmond	Tony	4	xxo2ATBDxJE	2066	2085	Actually, we're hopeful that this can help to reduce some of the burden on the court. By giving the defense attorney and the prosecutors a chance to work together in situations involving plea bargaining because the person being defended understands what their full consequences could be and, and their full rights.
4277	Stone	Jeff	26	MTWW-DN4Tdo	42	80	They claim the recession is over but I think we all know that technically it may be over but the fallout of the economy that we experienced, the great recession has left a lot of people needing a lot of help. And I've been very honored to be a part of solutions in discussing comprehensively the developmentally disabled population and doing what we can to advocate and hopefully through the budget process, return some of the billion dollars that we have taken away from this very important population of citizens.
4278	Mullin	Kevin	31	5Qw_YsDfvQ4	1025	1053	Very good. Mr. Ting is asking that the first roll be open for co-authors. The clerk will oopen the roll. All members vote wish to vote adding as co-authors on ACR 41. Members, this is for co-authors. We have 74 co-authors added to ACR 41. Without objection, we may take a voice vote on this item. All those in favor say aye. Those opposed say nay. The ayes have it. The resolution is adopted.
4279	Hernandez	Roger	37	_x7-b1Y1JBM	911	927	seeing those dollars being transferred over to paying for the 1% model. The 1% profiteering engine, that's what nonprofit 98 funds, we were never intended that and constituents in my community have a problem with that way of doing business with public tax dollars.
4280	Wood	Jim	72	cflx69hA7mw	469	484	Your bill is on call, you need one more vote.Thank you for being here. Next let's go to Assembly Member Perea. That's item 14, bill number AB 1412. Welcome.
4281	Wieckowski	Bob	55	5cExo6Kc7gQ	1458	1471	I have with me in support of the bill, the distinguished former past president of the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy, Ike Shulman, and Michael Malter from the law firm of Binder and Malter.
4282	Hertzberg	Robert	99	6r30p-6PJFA	497	524	First, SB 286 only applies to non-residential customers. Two, PUC section 380 requires that any cost shifting shall be allocated, equitably allocated, this is a quote from the bill, equitably allocated costs in a manner that prevents the shifting of costs between customer classes. This is a cost that is borne only by non-residential and you cannot shift between customer classes.
4283	Beall	Jim	92	ajUtne5r3JM	447	471	One one thing we used to do on the car, the California car, we had the, the joint purchase of the cars.  And I think if we did a joint purchase of engines. Of the highest quality low polluting engines, low noise, low polluting.  That would benefit all those communities that happened to be located along some of these commuter corridors and,
4284	Leno	Mark	60	GObd4JWklwI	2107	2133	Thank you Mr. Martin. I ask that you share with us the trailable language because I think it's an important detail here. In particular, since we've had such full discussions with regard to money following the consumer as we move from the state developmental center to the regional center community, fashion of delivery and services and that's an important piece for the community in particular. So...
4285	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	-OpN4Uo7BxE	1245	1260	Thereby increasingly opportunities for eligible citizens to participate in our democracy. More specifically, this bill will require the DMV to automatically transfer voter registration information to the Secretary of State, when a citizen obtains or renews a drivers licence or state ID.
4286	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	XDaCgfUVUtA	334	346	We have a unified water agency that is most of my district in the Department of Water and Power, and of course the MET and a couple of replenishment districts, or one replenishment district.
4287	Gordon	Richard	117	2D0v6cuDbfE	92	109	I appreciate the feedback from the Board of Pharmacy and our conversations with them and from these conversations and feedback, I understand also from the committee analysis that the term repackage may not be appropriate given federal requirements.
4288	Nielsen	Jim	68	LD6QgC66xr0	1686	1702	Item by item, over year after year the legislature's given this power to these agencies to just arbitrarily at their will decide how much they need and charge right up to the brink, with putting fees on Californians. It's got to be a no.
4289	Thurmond	Tony	4	A6ledtIW6-Y	146	161	We can have public comment and public comment is going to very, very, very brief. It will give you an opportunity to state your name, the organization that you represent and your position, either in favor or against the particular item.
4290	Cannella	Anthony	61	pjSDFWGC8xY	1339	1358	No, no. No don't worry, we've got somebody between us. I'm glad, but. That you're right, we don't, this is paying off transportation bonds, but I can't recall another general obligation bond that's being paid for by a special bond. This is I think the only one in the State of California, so it's very unusual.
4291	Bates	Pat	58	gN6B3iXXHo0	2002	2015	Often on occasion. So, I just think that it's, it's going in a good direction in terms of making sure landlords are really doing the job that they need to do, to ensure that their properties are in the best of condition for the residents.
4292	Alejo	Luis	9	_skeu0yft7s	142	154	And before I close I would just like to discuss why this bill contains a language requirements participants to have a history of prior agriculture work in the United States, from the start we have been adamant that this program is not a guest worker program.
4293	Bloom	Richard	2	_ES7C4KFvkc	1153	1174	Seems to me that if we're putting money into a pot to create this kind of connectivity we are losing an opportunity certainly for efficiency sake to go the distance and provide what is necessary for broader use.
4294	Santiago	Miguel	17	tEhMYBdIqkE	1775	1791	They're not the people who have the most articulate arguments and, quite frankly, in a lot of different ways, it's an invisible and silent victims, that we as lawmakers really have not focused and done enough of. And me too, I'll point at myself too.
4295	Monning	Bill	25	H8Ib2A9DciA	1394	1409	I want to also thank the employees that serve these courts, the courts for the services you're providing and your flexibility in trying to craft this to not have some of the feared unintended consequences. Thank you.
4296	Williams	Das	12	Z5dUcZuiBfw	1691	1713	There are a lot of plastic bags out there for a lot-a uses and I just don't think we need more of them. I think we probably have enough and we can let individuals choose when they need to buy paper and plastic bags. With that, the Chair's recommendation is no. There is a motion and a second. Secretary please call the roll.
4297	Bonta	Rob	85	Uoe2v6pAgNg	1555	1581	Thank you for raising the issuse assembly member Chaevz. Right now the way the bill is structure, it does not include humena. The reason for that is because we've conform to the data collection requirements and the bill with this us cecus categories that currently exist and that are complied with by UC and CSU.
4298	Wood	Jim	72	Tqcxk8QJsXU	868	886	I can guarantee you, we will be approached to address the access problems that this bill recruit will create in the future. I believe more time is needed to achieve a balance of that that works for all and until that balance is struck, I must oppose AB 533 due to the provisions involving the dispute resolution process. This is a complicated bill.
4299	Stone	Mark	20	EQZBghQKoaM	787	799	Thank you. And I'm still looking for a motion, and the motion is due passes amended two appropriations. So we do have a motion and a second. Call the role, please.
4300	Weber	Shirley	44	SWbNiLMydRA	607	644	On Saturday, April 4th, 2015, in North Carolina. North Charleston, South Carolina, a man named Walter Scott was pulled over in his car by officer Michael Slager. The two men walked over to a field where officer Slager allegedly began to question Mr Scott. The officer called in to let his department know that shots had been fired because the man tried to make his, take his gun and the officer tried to resuscitate him. The office and the media at first sought to justify the officer's actions. However, because of a gentleman that had a cell phone capable of video tape recording, video recording, the video proved otherwise and the officer's now facing justice.
4301	Hertzberg	Robert	99	6e0LFFmZAnE	1270	1291	How do you pay for it, what do you do, how do you define it? And it was problematic. So, the people of the state of California in 2004 passed Proposition 59 by nearly 10 million votes, an 83.4% margin, and they voted to include the Public Records Act in a much broader context in the Constitution of the State of California.
4302	Baker	Catharine	74	Gf9OHu0urRM	427	455	whom the state provides what you think is adequate funding, and I don't see anywhere in the state constitution that that's your priority. Seems to me the priority of the UC system is to educate and provide the best possible educational opportunity for California students. And when I've gone to the website of the UC systems website today, it says, the only world class research University for, by, and of California, to educate, illuminate, and serve,
4303	Bates	Pat	58	7htbC-5eCaQ	77	95	Existing penal code allows judges to impose a split sentence with a period of incarceration followed by a mandatory term of supervision for offenders convicted of a wide variety of criminal offenses including auto theft, second degree burglary, and selling controlled substances.
4304	McGuire	Mike	93	3F-MRhTliC4	372	389	And three, Mr. President, the federally protected co-host salmon would also be put at adverse risk. Support for this resolution is broad and deep. The United States Department of interior California State Parks, the Crescent City Council, and Del Norte Board of Supervisors, the Smith River and Elk Valley Rancherias trout unlimited and many more.
4305	Hertzberg	Robert	99	Y13vuRnCz5Y	589	597	Because they're in such pain that really making choices and had they had the right care and right  hospice they wouldn't be making these choices. They are just making it because of their circumstances.
4306	Baker	Catharine	74	Gf9OHu0urRM	455	480	not, to find out if there is a certain number of California residents that we think the state's provided enough funding for. So where I'm getting with this is I think the mission is getting split from what you need to be doing. And I look forward to the Chairman's and the Jail act report that will be coming back to this Committee, looking at this issue further. But, I hope it will include reexamination of what the purpose of the system is, which is not,
4307	Beall	Jim	92	1tbz59-ST4g	1076	1118	Yeah I think so. But I wanna also say that none of the proposed measures that I have financing the road repairs. My bill deals with road repairs. Actually, they're consistent with Senator Huff's constitutional amendment, but also consistent with the current constitution article 19. Okay, so it looks like things are starting to come together here. Now, the vehicle license fee is not included in any proposal I made. It was included in that original bill, SB 16.
4308	Nguyen	Janet	65	6Q9j6EYWwEw	1835	1851	I would always have to ask them where is the pain, how is it feeling, what's going on? Is it really a pain because children does not know the difference if you cannot see from far or close because they think it's natural.
4309	Beall	Jim	92	1tbz59-ST4g	1051	1062	I'll say that right up front. And I'll be willing to work with you on this constitutional amendment to make sure that happens. Okay, and Senator Huff has my pledge that I'll do that.
4310	Pavley	Fran	104	oUB8meWTgiM	991	1006	So they are starting down the road. Working with the State Water Board. DOGGR and the Water Board are spending a lot of time together on this in identifying which wells are the biggest problems. 23 have been shut down. They have a deadline of October.
4311	Leno	Mark	60	gWhhKfvsU08	205	220	Since then, as a result of that move, which was precipitated by the great fall in our state's revenue that childcare took an enormous hit and has not really regained in any way since then.
4312	Hertzberg	Robert	99	_QWOBYYvqfo	1240	1250	I think that it's part of a much bigger discussion. And I wanted to just kinda signpost these issues as we move forward, and think about this stuff, because these are really big policies.
4313	Nguyen	Janet	65	c8SqTr4brJk	1373	1391	It puts local government in a position that's really really unfair because are these good issues and we need to keep up with them versus letting them go and not having those reports to protect these families or the next incident that we could have prevented.
4314	Leno	Mark	60	o0ZtwE0t4Uk	1194	1218	With regard to drought, this Governor and the Administration have been unequivocal in their recognition of, and need to address climate change. It's a top priority for the Governor. I haven't read any reports, projections or news accounts that anyone suggests we're going to have greater snow pack as a result of climate change.
4315	Daly	Tom	118	mltOigqY7Qc	75	94	This legislation will provide an easy and popular way for Californian drivers to show their support for their favorite teams while also potentially contributing badly needed funds toward local parks and recreation programs in our state.
4316	Chang	Ling Ling	18	CVYbaFO-ROE	835	849	Members, this bill is about providing more options for state employees, saving taxpayer dollars and even protecting the environment. The sharing economy is becoming more ubiquitous and has become an integral part in the fabric of California's economy.
4317	Bonta	Rob	85	mNyHP9HDpqk	519	532	I, I do agree that we need to streamline and, and modernize the process by which doctors receive important information about a patient's medical care wishes through an advanced healthcare directive. And I want to acknowledge the hard work that the sponsors have done.
4318	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	H8Ib2A9DciA	706	738	I'm not sure that I would agree they have been abysmal they have been a little they have been a little bit remiss but with the budget of several billions of dollars I think that the audit did show that there was some problems but with all due respect I think abysmal is pretty strong word it wasn't quite that bad and maybe it's because I need dinner that I took a little umbrage to that but certainly there are things that we can do and I think that the senator has taken significant amendments here and I appreciate you doing that.
4319	Moorlach	John	4657	898OiW72jWg	315	332	And there are a lot of places where we outsource that made a lot of sense. So, I've enjoyed that kind of aspect for a good dozen years so I respect your concern. It's hard to give information to an August body like this in sound bites.
4320	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	HlZ2dOHrKsk	1912	1924	Thank you. I do have a question there was something that huge stated that I think might be worth exploring again. If it's a philosophical dispute and then we can disagree on philosophy.
4321	Vidak	Andy	56	6Q9j6EYWwEw	1059	1071	Madame President, members, I support Senate Bill 4 for the simple fact that taxpayers are already paying high healthcare costs for the undocumented Californians when they show up in our emergency rooms.
4322	Mitchell	Holly	64	4jcXQWLspO4	33	51	Were all your questions answered? Okay, excellent. All right, hearing that, we'll open up for public comment. Please step forward and again, we're taking all three items under the office of Aid Aids ADAP, the Eligibility Verification and Modernization.
4323	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	yXONMtuCfN8	1790	1815	And I want I appreciate you, humoring me with a bill a lot of people didn't think was very serious or meaningful, but when you look obviously at a case of a young woman like so many of us who grew up just dreaming to be a cheerleader, and then told that it's enough that you get the opportunity to come out and cheer, that you should not demand what every other worker in California gets, and that's dignity and respect under California State Laws. I respectfully ask an I vote.
4324	Chiu	David	7	86lIew9ia6A	1202	1219	Great, I'd very much appreciate that given that DACA and DAPA are affirmative relief programs with no court decision that's needed, again I think the challenges that our CBOs that are doing this hard work would be able to understand from an applicant or from all applicants, whether a decision's actually been made,
4325	Pavley	Fran	104	qTf-RqJKEFo	980	1005	You have five votes. That's enough, enough to pass but we'll leave it open for absent members to add-on. Let's move right on over to file item 13. This is Senate bill 355. Relates to the San Gabriel lower Los Angeles rivers and mountains conservancy and the make-up of the board and committees. Senator Lara?
4326	Chiu	David	7	DgVvXUz7n-U	679	699	Thank you Mr. Speaker. First of all, I want to start by acknowledging all the many conversations we have all had about this difficult decision. I think we've all struggled with what is a vote of conscience for all of us. As the son of a Doctor and as somebody who went to Catholic school, I greatly respect the diversity of opinions we have on this.
4327	Gallagher	James	108	1ddkqgmLsnY	928	942	It's just that we where we disagree is in the details of what that actually looks like. But, one thing I didn't see in here that I think should be something that's talked about is increasing our border security.
4328	Garcia	Cristina	112	h-QyikgWJeU	1173	1192	I encourage all members and staff to go to room 444 this morning until noon for blood pressure and health screens along with educational literature and healthy snacks. Next, I would also appreciated it everyone wearing red today, male and female would join us in the front of the room to take a picture today upon gavelling down. Thank you.
4329	Cooley	Ken	45	r1PhXBRe6ug	20	38	I rise really almost as a matter of personal privilege because in the last year-and-a-half that arc has found its way through my family as I now have a delightful granddaughter of African-American heritage, which I see is the climate that support that change my life I tribute to Doctor King and his leadership.
4330	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	akOKQetVqu4	182	203	Well, part of your point and I go the other question. If anybody else would like to weigh in, that's fine because we, Mr. McGhee, Miss Underhill, but a part of the kind of the fundamental point that I've heard from you just right now and previously was about how it may cost more to reach out to youth and all and the like.
4331	Salas	Rudy	34	fmIaR7hDQ6w	2106	2126	the feds to help these communities, I think that would be great. I know in the past when I was a staffer I worked on some of those projects. And then the other one I think someone brought up too, was the definition of a disadvantaged community, and how we can utilize that to access some of these funds.
4332	Pan	Richard	96	h3qpDny4S5o	1226	1242	What are you going to propose to do starting in July so that on July first something's going to be different so that kids are going to be helped. what are you going to  commit to now?
4333	Runner	Sharon	4656	Kg4hNcGh7pk	1253	1282	To my constituents: thank you for voting and I look forward to working with you all in this next couple years as we run again in 2016 in about a year. So thank you. The Pro Tem's office has just been amazing. The staff, Danny, all of the people that I've worked with. I have my staff all put together in the back, my family. You can all stand up.
4334	Gatto	Mike	46	uUsytMtXn1I	531	547	They could not believe that the government has a DNA bank of every child born in the state of California going back the last thirty years. Obviously this raises privacy concerns. What happens if this gets in the wrong hands? What happens if the genetic material gets in the wrong hands?
4335	Wolk	Lois	94	w3XqiN30Dys	2054	2063	Yes I want to thank the author for bringing this forward. I think it's an important effort. You know we've been waiting for another parks bond for a while.
4336	Daly	Tom	118	mltOigqY7Qc	495	519	We also like the idea of creating some pockets of money for local communities to compete for Park's funds, for local urban parks say. So that's still to be worked out, and there are other worthy possibilities as well for the revenue. But until we work out the details with Major League Baseball and the NFL, this has a ways to go.
4337	McCarty	Kevin	22	FLwgnBwucWM	55	67	That's the reason they're not agendized. Today's hearing is just on the Governor's May revised proposals. But nonetheless. If there are people who wanna speak on items not on the agenda, we'll hear that public comment at the very end.
4338	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	3bQ_hUBlpio	1512	1546	this year is a century of black life, history, and culture which highlights the great accomplishments of African-Americans. African-Americans who were able to overcome segregation and racism to achieve what to some may seem impossible and who were more times than not denied their basic civil and human rights, but still played an integral role in shaping history of this nation. Whether it's Marshall Major Taylor, a world champion cyclist in 1899 who had to
4339	Waldron	Marie	29	vsNWmpwObU4	793	811	The FDA and the House slow they are a lot of times, all the issues with that. All of those things go into the costs, so at this time I cannot support the bill. I definitely put my homework into it, and, so I'll be voting no at this time.
4340	Cooley	Ken	45	cflx69hA7mw	1405	1425	Yeah. And they said that there are counties that have been working with this idea. I think that will sharpen up the sort of proposals, you know, sort of raise the bar. They'll have a sense of what has been working. So, if someone brings something that, well we tried that elsewhere and it's not feasible you know, that would be a, i, it'll become a factor in where would the money be most propitiously spent.
4341	Thurmond	Tony	4	X89Kf9Sqs64	33	49	I'd like to just say, thank you to the members of this committee for their great work, to all the stakeholders, to representatives from various departments, to all of our budget staff, to our policy staff, and all of the interested parties who've spoken on these issues.
4342	Anderson	Joel	57	_4l4q_6Hap0	1735	1748	We get born here, and we forget that there's nothing free about freedom. So, I love these types of things. I'd be happy to work with you. But I also feel that the protections need to be strong as well.
4343	Garcia	Cristina	112	UmXyuczgH_s	1926	1938	And you have my commitment to definitely take this into serious consideration, and we respect that and we make it easier for that process to work. I do appreciate these concerns, and I think that they merit our attention.
4344	Thurmond	Tony	4	X89Kf9Sqs64	50	64	As you know, we've had many, many tough years in the last several years where we've seen dramatic cuts to health programs and to programs that serve seniors and foster-youth and others in our social safety network.
4345	Waldron	Marie	29	vsNWmpwObU4	779	793	This is a huge issue, I think we all need to have everyone at the table and start to talk about it, because the issues are insurance industry, the innovations, government regulations, how much does that impact?
4346	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	xJqN87zbSDI	682	702	Yes, just a couple thoughts. One is that I understand the need to make the statute of limitations equal. I always hesitate to defer to the federal laws when they are weaker than the state laws, but in this case I understand and I'm gonna support that.
4347	Mitchell	Holly	64	NOpjVjVZw80	389	406	Excellent. That would be helpful to us as members that they are included on an ongoing basis. Thank you. Finance or LAO? Any public comment on the overview of the department? Okay, we'll roll right into, oh, I'm sorry. Senator Stone. Welcome.
4348	Thurmond	Tony	4	gW4lj5dmrVY	47	60	And I'm honored to chair a Committee that has members who have deep concern for how we serve those in the developmental centers and how we support our providers who are serving folks in the community.
4349	Leyva	Connie	62	GE9yKeDoFKQ	44	63	One thing that has been overlooked is clean water in the schools for our children. Currently there is no requirement to test drinking water in our schools. Unfortunately, chemicals such as lead, which we know are very harmful to students, may be present in water provided in some of California's schools.
4350	McGuire	Mike	93	GnxGwd8ZNfU	228	258	In 2012, the Governor presented a restructuring plan of the program that shortened an adult's eligibility for welfare-to-work program to 24 months, unless they're working in unsubsidized jobs. Representatives of the administration told us here in the Legislature that with the shorter clock clients would be getting earlier and more meaningful engagement with case workers at the front end, which would help connect them with a more individualized opportunity to find jobs and enhance educational access.
4351	Wood	Jim	72	fnhJHfsu-gk	439	452	The more you over burden our system the more people are affected and it's not a positive effect obviously. So I really thank you for your presentation and the clarity that you have brought to the message you brought to us. Thank you.
4352	Stone	Jeff	26	34DjaBqbEpQ	1510	1523	Yeah. So I wanted to just instill with my colleagues here today that I think that California, which I think should be a leader in everything that we do, should emphasize the importance of paramedics on motorcycles.
4353	Leno	Mark	60	k_l5daYZc00	1601	1632	Thank you. That says it all. I was fascinated because I wasn't quite sure where anyone in line was going to fall on this. We're all over the map so clearly the good news is we have some time to work on this. And good points made on both sides. We do have two motions. Our process is such.
4354	Chiu	David	7	quIuv9zWSqs	34	44	Thank you, Miss Porter. First, I wanna thank you for you're leadership for many years on this topic and to our colleagues. Miss Porter was one of the first advocates in my office five years ago in San Francisco. To educate me on this issue and I know because of time you didn't have time to get into all the various policy options that you've considered.
4355	Mitchell	Holly	64	fVP93psOcMo	1596	1615	I'm hoping that we'll use kind of the new admissions, for lack of better term, as to some degree of learning ground but, how you identify various particularly with limited to now stake holder, provider, consumer, involvement?
4356	Wood	Jim	72	D1U0Ojzunqk	811	828	Thank you and I also wanna thank my colleague from the senate. If there are any two people in the legislature who understand this issue, it is Senator McGuire and myself because we live it every day. It is an extremely complicated issue. I'm not gonna talk about my particular bill.
4357	Achadjian	K.H. "Katcho"	5	nQyRqNn-8MI	494	515	Going back to Proposition 218, which clearly spells out that you may not impose additional fees to wherever the discount has to be, the gap has to be filled in by rate payers, but you got to get money from somebody else to give somebody else a discount. Have we looked into that law? If its in violation that law or...
4358	Frazier	Jim	114	9A2k7SwFZ7M	163	173	I can agree I just had a pothole come loose on the freeway and took out my windshield so I can identify. Mr. Linder, I'm sorry I didn't see you.
4359	Chu	Kansen	32	SaBiGmhdX4s	1839	1869	So, what does it take for the SBA to have more literature in Chinese, and also the district I represent has a high percent concentration of Vietnamese Americans. So, what does it take for you to have multiple language brochures in Chinese, Vietnamese, and maybe in Korean as well?
4360	Leyva	Connie	62	oDMixRIfl_Y	250	268	Great. Thank you. The PUC has amazing jurisdiction over various industries. This is for either one of you. One of those industries is the TNCs, Uber, Lyft, and those car industries.
4361	Holden	Chris	78	0LdXFnPqPCk	2078	2095	He also managed the Pasadena Unified School District federal title one program. Over a 60 year career in education, James also served as a principle in Los Angeles and Monrovia Unified School District. James Lites was a strong education advocate and served my community with distinction. I thank you for adjourning in his memory.
4362	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	J0XgdYqFY4Y	430	439	up and now you don't have those, as many of those interactions as you had before because you changed the way you did law enforcement with tasers, with other
4363	Block	Marty	59	Ouu9P0a4sNE	81	98	Rachel from the LAO, Legislative Analyst Office. Gina who is the chair of the State Advisory Commission on Special Education. This is an information only item. On the special education task force report. We'll, we'll begin with Ehlers.
4364	Chavez	Rocky	83	NNzDQCiG5UU	775	801	Ambassador, it's been an honor to know you. You're a great man and when you go to Texas don't forget to take care of our veterans. Thank you very much, sir.
4365	Cooper	Jim	21	4tou47dRNaA	1112	1144	Thank you Mr. Speaker and members, AB. 906 is a district bill sponsored and supported my home city of Elk Grove. The bill updates the city of Elk Grove proportionate share payment to the Sacramento regional transit district to reflect changes since Elk Grove incorporated the city in 2000, currently Elk Grove Proportional Share payment, is based on outdated state law and does not take into account measurably contribution by Elk Grove residents, measurably contribution generate approximately 35 million each year, for RT for transit services.
4366	Hancock	Loni	98	MYV8uPNEbmU	40	64	And I will just say, that having clarified that the records remain open to probation, for the purposes of putting together programs and rehabilitative activities, I'm prepared to vote for the bill, as amended. And please read the roll. Is there a motion of the bill? Thank you.
4367	Grove	Shannon	77	VuyRexRzUE4	1556	1586	When they leave the DC Centers, they're basically give me your wheelchairs, give me your bed, give me all your stuff and then you go to the community, and the community is responsible for providing this stuff for you. It creates a delay for the people, they don't have the stuff right away and it just sits there and the DC's, especially with the reduction in the people that are being held are DC's. So I guess my question is that, what's your thought process on allowing the community to either purchase or give it?
4368	Gomez	Jimmy	80	JgpqDSrKaXw	1504	1525	AB 399, Ridley-Thomas, Unemployment Insurance for Classified Employees Holding Committee. AB 431, Gray, Internet Poker, do pass. Republicans not voting. AB 435, Chang, CaliPA and the Natural Resources Agency webcast of public meetings and workshops.
4369	Leno	Mark	60	GIcgVGMKBjg	1600	1620	And what this bill does with regard to the department authority is simply that when it observes a new unauthorized and deleterious diversion, and it has to meet all three of those observations, then it would have the ability to apply a civil penalty.
4370	Allen	Benjamin	70	898OiW72jWg	2342	2361	If I could just make one comment to Senator Moorlach. I got that ticket on the same freeway that Senator Hertzberg mentioned. I wrote in, they immediately reimbursed me. So, I gotta say, there was great customer service. And I would encourage Senator Hertzberg to write a letter next time. All right. Thank you for the customer service.
4371	Lara	Ricardo	107	w2OxGtfP7pQ	1332	1355	The bill specifies that individuals cannot interfere with an officer's ability to exercise his or her duties or obstruct officers in any way. The purpose of this bill is not to make law enforcement's job more difficult, but rather to clarify existing law to limit future conflicts between officers and civilians.
4372	Wieckowski	Bob	55	Ol0PhdDSV8c	163	173	It's frighteningly apparent from the hearing that many of those climate impacts are happening right now, and in order to step off the worst and most severe impacts of climate change,
4373	Hancock	Loni	98	QoWDHxezaEY	190	217	I did have one question, though. Well, the add-ons to the fines I think are problematic, but it isn't just this bill, it's the fines in general. So, I'm thinking that I would support the bill today, understanding that a $250 fine is a $1,000 fine, and so forth as it goes up.
4374	Chiu	David	7	wIEWRsTF1no	313	338	Great, thank you. Let me ask first, if there are any questions from the committee. No. Department of Finance, do you have any comments? And L.A.O., any comments? Let me ask if there are members of the public that want to provide any public comment. Are you here for public comment? Yeah. If you want, if you can please line up.
4375	Hueso	Ben	48	uymj8kL8SYs	866	891	It's a lot more than a hundred fifty dollars, and it's a lot more than a hundred fifty dollars multiplied by a hundred, hundred years. We're talking about, I'm sorry maybe not hundred-years but, the next, you know, ten years for sure, I mean, one or more structures are very expensive to direct and to replace, and people's personal property.
4376	Nazarian	Adrin	36	378WZJyyxT0	444	467	I think it will probably be important for us, for this item, as well as the next, but we'll hear from the next item, to reduce both to 1 million and see on an ongoing basis what the continued need would be. So if I can have a motion for 1 million.
4377	Hall	Isadore	1	fRdlkKyIGD4	958	997	Knowing that there could possibly be a perspective where you say, hey, I don't wanna do anything, and then we're not moving forward at all. And, that's not a place where I wanna be. I wanna see something get done, and so that's why I say we move the bill forward today, and let the chair and I will if there's some comfort with the committee, I'll reserve the right to bring the bill up back to committee. All right? And so that's. So I'll make a committment to call the bill back if necessary. All right? Yes?
4378	Calderon	Ian Charles	115	KWh7S198Y54	219	247	And so we took a step forward; myself, Mr. Nazarian, Mr. Daly, we were able to fight and get the state's contribution from a million dollars a year, to five million dollars a year, and we would really like to see that number go up, because Mr. Obernolte, as you can appreciate, arts funding breeds creativity, which then helps us provide the necessary work force to supply workers to this creative economy, to tech companies, entertainment companies.
4379	Monning	Bill	25	UZoibo7LDfc	920	946	We need to counterbalance that, and let some successful entertainers and athletes, not for a fee but for their volunteer commitment and giving back to their communities, to step up and be the face with some of these changes of the parks; and so young kids see the people they look up to encouraging them to access the parks.
4380	Hertzberg	Robert	99	Wq4BKtQGDbc	177	194	But I only suggest this. As somebody, you know, I was the gut during Al Gore and Bush thing came back to California when fine to find that 53% of our voting machine were the same kind of machines that were the problems there and put up the $200 million bond obviously with the voters.
4381	Melendez	Melissa	41	Lkk9mVJ5y6k	1430	1451	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just out of curiosity, what about taking the fireworks that are legal and dispersing them to Various cities throughout the state who have fireworks shows on Fourth of July and things like that. Are we allowed to do that? Fewer fireworks to dispose of.
4382	McGuire	Mike	93	R2W5ElFvow0	1951	1975	The Obama administration granted a five year moratorium. If we want to talk about how this state can receive the funds of draining is the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. That will guarantee ongoing revenue coming into the State of California. I'd also like to be able to address the issue of loophole because we've been in direct communication with Mr. O'Connell.
4383	Stone	Jeff	26	pw6Q8UN0xPc	1575	1597	So if we have an indication that we're on track to getting these revenues, then why not begin to fund programs based on having those funds available? So again, education is important to me. I wanna fund it. I wanna make sure we have a good, educated workforce. I wanna take care of our kids at an earlier age. Invest in them. I'd rather invest before than later in our legal judicial system.
4384	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	GLTSZcMPtQ8	94	110	With me today is Jennifer, I don't have a Jennifer, okay, with me I have Glenn, not Jennifer Kim from the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights, and Darris Young, a former parolee.
4385	Brown	Cheryl	13	GY0D4Q5rw0s	1466	1487	in their own homes, avoiding costly placement in institutional settings. The drastic cuts of tenures have done serious harm, devastating the ability of Area Agencies on Aging to fulfill projected growth over the next three decades. Not to mention the growing prominence of Alzheimer's disease.
4386	Gray	Adam	27	Ew5hLn0iC0U	863	877	The analysis has recommended an amendment so that primary care clinics start reporting to the department when they are operating an intermittent clinic and I am happy at the chair's wish to take that as author's amendment.
4387	Stone	Mark	20	0xUa-SoTZfU	24	45	And in my part of this is, my concern is that it be, if this is gonna be something that's now part in parcel of a religious school that it's something that is used consistently because I think there is a state interest there. And that's one of something that I'm trying to understand, and trying to frame.
4388	Nazarian	Adrin	36	aYmlFd2X1yI	50	69	And two, for failure to reimburse an employee for all necessary expenditures incurred by the employee, directly related to his/her duties as required by existing state law. This bill states that the labor commissioner shall not issue a citation if the local entity has cited or has initiated investigation for the same violation.
4389	Hertzberg	Robert	99	6e0LFFmZAnE	1692	1708	And so, there's been a lot of folks, certainly the number of the communities, you'll see the depth and breadth of support of this bill. And there's been a lot of the people who operate the government on the day to day basis who will tell you all the reasons why this thing is horrible and why it's gonna effect them.
4390	Hall	Isadore	1	OIbMOKdbCjk	1581	1600	Yes, thank you madame President. I just wanted to add my respect as well as our President protem did as relates to Connor Burns. His father Steven Burns, as mentioned, is an outlier in our community for the State of California doing extraordinary work
4391	Grove	Shannon	77	bn5R6N5l4NI	1538	1553	You have evidence of that? And the reason why is because I do believe that the Worker's Comp system is construed in a no-fault system where you don't have to prove fault by, you know, it's a no-fault system. And it is, like the witness said, it's liberally construed to benefit the employee on all counts of the law.
4392	Bonta	Rob	85	J5uWaWJYgpA	499	522	Any other comments or questions from members on this topic? Thank you, Mr. Sisney, appreciate it. Let's go to public comment. We have a microphone set up. We can just line up for comment.
4393	Weber	Shirley	44	BvL-PHidNXM	921	936	But I gather, based on the conversation that will hold this item open, I just wanna make sure we were clear in what we were saying as to what the two proposals, cuz they're very similar. It's just, you know, in the end we end up in the same spot, okay?
4394	Mitchell	Holly	64	cXnV6IOLWSg	94	117	Thank you, 3191 for transportation. Colleagues, the Senate Sergeant is at the rear of the chambers and will lead us to the ceremony. Again transportation Committee Members be mindful of your seating so you won't disrupt the program when you have to leave. Senator Wieckowski.
4395	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	KZTa69-ElFQ	2024	2048	Obviously, there will be people who we're going to still need prisons for but do we really need as many as we have right now? And if we can kind of gauge what that number is so we can start drawing down in a responsible way because obviously, the last thing we want to do is eliminate a prison when we really need one.
4396	Hertzberg	Robert	99	iTrvWXqiedk	2367	2388	The reason why it raises the question that this is about revenue and not about safety. You could put signs a thousand feet out, 500 feet out, hikers available, I mean hikers around or you can come up with speed bumps that do not affect strollers, or bicycles, or something, with experts. So I think what I would certainly like us to do, and I told this to Senator Huff, is to work with him on this measure afterwards,
4397	Bonta	Rob	85	DJsU22tiuNg	811	821	If we had a public transparent database for payments, which we don't, but we probably should. I think we would have a greater likelihood of coalescing around that approach.
4398	De Leon	Kevin	102	XFSLCFM97Og	1318	1337	We want to welcome you to the state of California. Very impressive. This is a very important issue, an issue dealing with income and equality. Often times, especially with lower-income households, single mothers, the other parents in this case, by far and large, the father of the child is also of low income.
4399	Alejo	Luis	9	UonYQneKEjk	1866	1873	We have worked with ACSA to come up with this most recent amendments this week to find a more reasonable middle ground on this bill. I respectfully ask for an Aye vote.
4400	Hernandez	Ed	103	L_nqL1xdfS8	568	590	Yeah you know, I think that if you look at a peer review as a whole for all professions, I think if you're gonna ask it for pharmacy I think we should ask that question as a legislature for all professions. Find out if in fact that they're doing what they're supposed to do and most importantly is protecting the public. Maybe that's something AshPed might be able to do, which studies and looks at different professions.
4401	Hernandez	Ed	103	DJsU22tiuNg	821	836	Well, I know somebody has been running that bill for several years. Somehow it doesn't get out of appropriations. So would maybe the proponents like to respond to any of the comments?
4402	Leno	Mark	60	0MzTgkt-Llc	1180	1194	Landed on five. San Francisco is the only county out of the 58, of course which is city and county. Which has 11. We don't have a city council. So a reason for that, but that number also is arbitrary.
4403	Cooley	Ken	45	kLTY4thtXsA	132	149	But I would just note, I would say conceptually, the key things to know about my bill are sort of two. One is it contemplates a single state agency that will do the basic framework of regulation across all of state government. It will ally itself.
4404	Cannella	Anthony	61	LhZTpLi6UbE	207	220	So look. It's the law, the fee is being collected, really it's my goal that we'll use it too protect life and property out in those state areas. And you both said you were going to do that.
4405	Alejo	Luis	9	99NWh04_JOI	2422	2436	And certainly the access of 2 million Californians who utilize these places is of utmost importance, as is the consumer protection, but I remember when I was a Assembly Fellow here in 2002 when I had no health insurance.
4406	Weber	Shirley	44	EupEjx01Yv8	162	174	Specifically this bill modernizes and broadens the current HIV mandate to reflect today's understanding and increase the instructions and impact on reducing HIV, other sexually transmitted infections and unintended pregnancies.
4407	McGuire	Mike	93	8s6GBqKeNwE	0	21	And just a quick item for the Chair. And I think what I've heard, in particular from city council representatives and board of supervisor representatives in Marin County, is that I think we're there looking about some specific language on CEQA, as if there is substantial change to the site.
4408	Gallagher	James	108	24W2oeMkjbI	314	328	Well, so then, that's my other concern. If they're serving the general public of California shouldn't we have. I mean, I think there's a lot of cases here in California where we don't say, hey, what the federal government says is good enough. This is California.
4409	De Leon	Kevin	102	SNbIvbnUyMw	776	799	Is it the Department itself that is swallowing up also, too, the directors? Or a combination thereof? Because obviously as you stated, hazardous waste, contaminated sites, really, really harmful, really dangerous chemicals  in communities.
4410	Gomez	Jimmy	80	-Nb5xJu_Rq4	1678	1699	Dr. Wood, we're gonna start with committee member, well, we have Mr. Gato. Mr. Gato, are you ready or should we go with the committee members first? We, okay, we'll wait. Mr. Wood?
4411	Wieckowski	Bob	55	r0_c68VZXFY	1362	1382	Currently workers who have been already living paycheck to paycheck, are currently going without essentials like groceries and medicine. Bills and rents can not be paid on time. And consequently some families are being pushed on public assistance. This bill ties the garnishment rate to the workers income to the creditors.
4412	Calderon	Ian Charles	115	KWh7S198Y54	169	195	But what changed was that it was a million dollars a year from the state which was the bare minimum, the federal government would do a onetime, a match of whatever we did, the federal government would match. Last year we were lucky enough to have a one-time gift of about two million dollars from the Speaker, and anything else comes from sales such as license plates sales that would all go to arts funding which is what was roughly about five million dollars.
4413	Thurmond	Tony	4	gvsFAuMIegs	2362	2375	We can't fix that here today, but I think that's something that we'd all be committed to working on together, maybe in this committee. I don't think that this bill, though, disadvantages our manufacturing committee, but I appreciate you clarifying your statement. Thank you so much.
4414	De Leon	Kevin	102	_C-l6C8Fln0	82	109	That makes it very special. I want to recognize, we have already, but I want to think again the great lieutenant Governor of the great State of California. That is again lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom. The Madam Chief Justice, again. Thank you so very much.
4415	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	eibZ1b56Plc	513	532	we were hoping to ban the use of dispersants we know that they're terribly toxic. They don't necessarily accomplish anything, but we took that amendment at their request. And that was the only concern that they articulated. And they went neutral on the bill and that was that.
4416	Alejo	Luis	9	99NWh04_JOI	1663	1675	As we moved forward, we knew we needed more time. We also have this part of this current bill before us today, was also done consultation with the chief enforcement agency which is the Attorney General's office.
4417	Levine	Marc	8	XDaCgfUVUtA	661	669	You don't need to respond to me immediately if you don't want to 'cause I know I've got a lot of other members that want to ask a few questions as well, but you can kind of
4418	Mullin	Kevin	31	UonYQneKEjk	1345	1370	Thank you, Mr Wagner. Seeing no additional discussion on this item, Mr Ting defers. We will open the roll.  All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. Clerk will close the roll. Tally the vote. Aye's: 51, No's: 18. Measure passes. File item five, AB 647. Clerk will read.
4419	Wieckowski	Bob	55	heZIL8I4UGg	115	130	The second speaker will walk us through the basics of the environmental review process. And, finally, our third speaker will talk about recent legislation, the CEQA guidelines, and the role of the State Clearinghouse.
4420	Cooley	Ken	45	1NZUtvyVKUY	1129	1147	And this is the way in which this bill seeks to balance the interests of local governments and medical marijuana. And this makes sense. I think medical marijuana dispensaries are important for the individuals involved, but they also have a bearing on local quality of life.
4421	Lara	Ricardo	107	ZhE_hzRecAQ	1208	1229	To be clear, this portion of AB1461 is delayed until three things happen. Until VoterCal, the new state-wide voter registration database is up and running, two the Legislature appropriates necessary funding for the program, and that Secretary of State has adopted the necessary regulations specified in this bill
4422	Pan	Richard	96	2mUHw1EX7J4	1797	1812	That you don't have to worry about getting on a subway or a bus and being exposed to serious illness. That you're not getting notes from your child's school, that they might have been exposed because somebody in the school had chicken pox or measles or whooping cough.
4423	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	QnBcTK-as8k	919	935	This measure also extends the California Family Rights Act job protections to more employees by lowering the employer size threshold. Ensuring that married couples who work for the same employer are also able to access as much of the benefit as possible.
4424	Pan	Richard	96	IUqqKj1b5UE	1033	1049	So it only applies to some physical space that's purely for observation, that's not an emergency room, it's not actually a floor, I mean physically the floor, physically in ICU, it's that's what you're talking about.
4425	Patterson	Jim	119	UDPqIWouyOQ	2010	2025	If there are teachers who continue to do damage to students, we owe it to those children to find them, help them, improve them before they can get back into the classroom.
4426	Mitchell	Holly	64	SyoQEeEJfIE	732	742	So I think that's a, this doesn't just apply to the Department of Public Health. Like I said, a number of the plans that we reviewed in the sub-committee are late.
4427	Jones	Brian	42	2b3SgDbb8jI	317	337	Also based on my experience as a commercial real estate agent in trying to place specialized properties in different locations, recognizing that they have different parking requirements than what the universal building code recognizes. I might be able to support this bill when it gets to the floor, but
4428	Pan	Richard	96	qMylnhtxSF8	1709	1763	And of course, even if herd immunity, and with herd immunity decreasing, that probability is actually going up. Right, so 20 years ago, measles, well, measles actually. We didn't even have 100 cases in the whole country. We had 40, 80 cases. Now we had 600 in the whole country last year. So as physicians are working with the parents trying to assess risk, they have to think about there's the vaccine, right, and what the rationale is, right? Clearly if they have an immune compromised, etc, there may be some more areas that are grey areas, and again, that's a judgment call. And then they have to weigh that against the probability of that child actually catching the disease and catching it from someone else, right, and how that balances out.
4429	Hancock	Loni	98	pvvkVbDJBVE	1240	1276	His organizing included cross-country hitchhiking with Pete Seager and meeting with Eleanor Roosevelt as part of her quest to know what youth were thinking back in the 1930s. He was drafted into the army in October 1941, and was sent to Massachusetts Institute of Technology to study radar.
4430	Weber	Shirley	44	WBiuNzDlh60	439	456	You can do homeschooling on your own. I mean, I have a niece who's homeschooled her kids their entire life and that's an option. But, she was under the guidance and she had to adhere to the curriculum of her school district in California and in Colorado where she lives now.
4431	Fuller	Jean	49	0XEmXVzSg6Q	1336	1352	And the only way we can memorialize standing against this, whether it's an Asian country, a middle eastern country where it is, is to get up and talk like we are today about the lessons that we learn from everyone's perspective.
4432	Lara	Ricardo	107	Kg4hNcGh7pk	435	617	Members, we're still lacking a quorum. If you could please make your way to the Senate Floor so we can commence our Senate session. Secretary please call the roll.
4433	Pan	Richard	96	XxAKuU0JQuk	27	48	Today, we'll be discussing the policy implications of mandating CalPERS to include one or more high-deductible healthcare plans in the Public Employee Medical and Hospital Care Act, or PEMHCA, which is the healthcare program administered by CalPERS for state employees and retirees and other local contracting public employers and their employees and retirees.
4434	Hueso	Ben	48	OaKXojP7k_0	927	942	that they advised them not to use this industry because it was not regulated and it was a danger to them. They didn't say they would not reimburse they just said we recommend that
4435	Gomez	Jimmy	80	rOcxPrNyERc	934	946	If we have a grandparent who gets sick ,we should have that responsibility to want to go and take care of them because that's where are values start right, with our family and how we act with our family.
4436	Waldron	Marie	29	UonYQneKEjk	981	991	Thank you, Mr Speaker. I too rise in support of AB 1102. I supported in health. I feel it's an important bill for women when they find that they're pregnant, and they need that care.
4437	Leno	Mark	60	zqM_Vy0kspE	1828	1844	But, it would be the relatively minor inconvenience if I were to go to 10,000, I can get that light off, so I'm going to have a red light and it also obscures some of the other information that I can use. So that's just another thing you might look into further.
4438	Beall	Jim	92	JB8xflm0bpc	1447	1467	And there's also no presumption that taxes will go up. There's no presumption that taxes will go up with this. That's not part of the decision that the committee will make, it will be a decision that is vested in us, the legislature, obviously and the voters of course.
4439	Fuller	Jean	49	0XEmXVzSg6Q	1380	1397	So for me, I thank our Senator. I think all of you who gave your perspective because certainly I know that we have advocacy areas that don't see it quite the same way, but articulating how they see it is important.
4440	Nielsen	Jim	68	2vPXZZpEjE4	1221	1243	And then, Senator any of the witnesses, as to the nature of the urgency in the emergency situation, I mean, the chairman's graciously offered to be paying attention to it in the interim as it be a two year bill and I think that's a good solution today. But, what is the, say the two year urgency here? What are we looking at, as far as impacts?
4441	Linder	Eric	39	zdfniIDuOwc	318	334	But this bill will ensure that more of them are given the chance to be a part of someone's family. Now I know that I'm not alone in knowing first hand how much love and companionship man's best friend can bring to a family.
4442	Huff	Bob	105	9eA3HqZp1ws	1047	1080	Thank you madame President and members. We truly live in a very diverse state and through that diversity, we have strength. We've seen some of that this morning from the previous presentations. But down in my district, we have a different group and you may know that some of my communities are over 60% Asian. So if you have been following me around for the last couple of weeks, you would hear me say "Xnnin kuil gong xi fa cai" and that is a happy new year.
4443	Alejo	Luis	9	UMlpaC9VCt4	36	60	But, that's all right with me, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman I got six bills before you today. Three are heading to suspense, three are not. I'm waiving presentation on suspense bills AB 865, 1315 and 1447 and we're having presentation on a bill that's on consent, AB 684 so we will only be presenting on AB 443 and 1075.
4444	Beall	Jim	92	JKPJXBAVEPo	0	19	Transportation and Housing as a subcommittee; we'd like to call all members to the committee. So, we will begin our meeting. I would like to ask everybody to turn off their cellphones and all of those kinds of noisy things.
4445	Holden	Chris	78	etnGLuiVGv4	1134	1166	Thank you Mr. Speaker. There are Committee reports at the desks relative to the following bills. Senate bill 145, Senate bill 150, Senate bill 377, SCR 79, SJR 11 and AB 232. I request unanimous consent that the Committee reports be deemed read and deemed adopted and to suspend assembly rule 63 to allow the bills to be taken up without reference to file for purposes of concurring
4446	Gallagher	James	108	4lx0MqjDD6Q	1437	1459	I guess one of the concerns is that if, why not leave this to local jurisdictions, who, if they find that there's a public building or a street name that is offensive to the community's sensibilities, can then go and change that at the local level. Why are we doing this at the sate level?
4447	Garcia	Cristina	112	v8nsxSPxdAk	289	298	Two of them being major porters for transportation between the port of Long Beach and the rail yards which are both ends of my district also. And so we're seeing this everyday.
4448	Pavley	Fran	104	b4USpkALPiM	1915	1943	We are going to have less snow and more rain at higher elevations. How will that impact a sea level rise on 1100 miles of coast? And if you're in a disadvantaged community, the link between climate change and air pollution is real. I've been to enough international symposiums where doctors have made that clear link between climate change and warmer temperatures, and asthma and heat episodes and the list goes on and on.
4449	Morrell	Mike	51	8-bIXhKX8x4	311	330	I guess the second question- - Which is the more important thing you're trying to accomplish, the climate control or return on investment, because my big concern is, we're members of the Legislature, and they have a board that appoints and hires investors.
4450	Allen	Benjamin	70	MpQ4SGzO7GE	471	484	It seems to be a very carefully written bill that addresses a lot, in fact all of the key concerns that I heard raised by the opposition. I just want to hear your response to that, cuz I'm, I'm having trouble  understanding how this is gonna destroy your business in the internet as we know it.
4451	Hertzberg	Robert	99	cr1U1amFOTo	1530	1564	Number two is, you do have an over-generation and what you're seeing, in my judgement is, as we've talked about in this committee a number of times, is a transition. Where, as the chairman indicates, the idea of jobs, the idea of using electricity for transportation, Edison is talking about using it for water or for trains. You can take this over-generation and really create real jobs and domesticate as we've talked about energy supply, which domesticates jobs, and eliminates us from the extraordinary international volatility of situations around the world that are putting our young people in harms way by putting them in the military.
4452	Gray	Adam	27	iDZCoA28Gzg	1246	1264	Military IDs have been changed only to reflect the date of birth and a photo of military personnel. For many of these individuals, their military IDs are the only type of identification they have in their possession. And this measure would simply give our military men and women the same rights we provide for our regular population.
4453	Grove	Shannon	77	A6ledtIW6-Y	1471	1481	Is there a priority to shut down the decertified units in Sonoma before anything else? Is there a priority? I mean, they're already decertified. They're already not even receiving federal dollars, the work crew hired to back fill in is there.
4454	Nielsen	Jim	68	-R2gq2-ns5U	1644	1656	Why? Because of the backlog, and this tracking of historical performance and accountability is really something important, and this could be a significant step that would help us with all agencies, so
4455	Gaines	Ted	24	JKPJXBAVEPo	469	491	Yeah, I just want to make a comment. We've had a similar situation my district in Lincoln, and we have a Sun City Community there that uses golf carts actually to get to downtown Lincoln, and so they've made provisions for wider bike lanes that can fit these vehicles in the lane and do it in a safe fashion.
4456	Leno	Mark	60	-absEc_YvaI	989	1004	But if they enter into our restoration of competency program, then the state will cover that cost for community treatment setting. And you're telling us that you have information to suggest that we actually get better results at the county level.
4457	Williams	Das	12	CexTEpx85rk	1298	1318	And so, both the stakeholder groups, mobile home park owners, as well as GizMall are supporting waiving the title requirements. And as noted in the analysis, each of these costs are expected to be fully offset by the technical service fee authorized in the bill.
4458	Pavley	Fran	104	tz0avG0I2sM	1	28	Good point. We normally need some transfer formative technological breakthroughs in many areas to achieve 2050 targets or anything like that. Is there limitations for like investing, for example, the same battery storage?
4459	Melendez	Melissa	41	rW1B4Jx9iIw	1443	1460	Okay, and so what I would like to hear, and I think the members of the committee would like to hear is that you're committed to meeting that deadline and committed to ensuring that your local agencies have some sort of motivation to give you the material you need so that you can give us what you're statutorally required to give us. Do we have that commitment from you?
4460	Gomez	Jimmy	80	xxo2ATBDxJE	339	354	Thank you so much. We're going to do a quick procedural. We're going to, members, we're going to have a quick procedural motion to dispense with. AB 684 Bonilla, is on file today for purposes of amendment only.
4461	Pavley	Fran	104	0J9n2c3eCds	337	346	Very good and now back to the matter at hand. A motion. Senator Stone move the bill. Comments or questions? Roll call vote please. The motion will be do pass to appropriations.
4462	Gaines	Ted	24	_Bb4hK8XVqo	1266	1276	And I've talked to a number of members in this Committee about that and I just think that that's something we ought to keep looking at. So thank you, I appreciate that.
4463	Gordon	Richard	117	a4X1msw4NL8	720	741	Thank you Mr. Speaker. AB 379 allow school-aged foster youth and homeless youth, to use the uniform plate procedure as a way to file complaints to the school district about not obtaining their deserved educational rights. Senate amendments address chaptering conflicts. I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
4464	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	nugSHhjUz14	1857	1879	In addition, with the California Highway Patrol there have been a lot of discussion about body cameras, and one of the things that this body, the assembly, needed to do was make sure that our own group, the California Highway Patrol, which is basically our police force, that they become at the forefront of using body cameras.
4465	Chau	Ed	116	2X-V6mACHAA	15	35	And today we have three bills on the agenda, and one on consent. Looks like we have for our first presentation. Senator Liu. Would you like to come up and present your bill. That's on SB 580. Welcome.
4466	Allen	Benjamin	70	ukB39_tnTUw	1503	1523	Thank you. Congratulations. That passes. We'll keep it open for Senator Hertzberg to weigh in if he so chooses. Thank you. Thank you so much. So we'll next hear from Assemblymember Hernandez. Yes. We had a vote on consent but we'll let you add on. Let's have a vote on consent real quick while-
4467	Bonilla	Susan	3	mork537FlJg	440	463	AB 963 will end the existing confusion on what activities are credible for CalSTRS membership. CalSTRS predicts the fiscal impact of this bill is below $100,000, and the Appropriations Committee analysis also predicts it's about $100,000 of special fund money for technology costs, and I respectively ask for your aye vote.
4468	Rendon	Anthony	120	r49jrzf4Gi8	1182	1205	Thank you Mister Chair and good morning. AB 1119 is a bill about parity and it's about parity between cities and counties and gives counties the same authority to challenge development projects that encroach upon their territory, upon their unincorporated county territory that cities enjoy.
4469	Stone	Jeff	26	4jcXQWLspO4	1157	1186	Thank you for your testimony today. I'm sitting here kind of in awe that in contemporary society today that we still see people sharing needles and what's the second largest cause of HIV/AIDS and is it still the lack of education or is lack of financial resources what does the ideology of this propagation of this problem if you will, with sharing needles? Where are we going wrong?
4470	Maienschein	Brian	84	-v-krVjWW-I	1012	1032	Other witnesses in support? Seeing none. Witnesses in opposition? Seeing none. Questions or comments from the committee? Motion from Mr. Chiu. Second from Ms. Waldron. Ms. Gaines, would you like to close?
4471	Leno	Mark	60	ELlYlrBZUfQ	1671	1688	That's what I thought I heard you say. Okay, page seven. C post composition. And the Senate had a modified version of the governor's, but should we hear the governor's first? Ms. Bosler?
4472	Lara	Ricardo	107	kyRwF6Xn7UY	668	684	6 to 1 that item is out. Moving on to Assemblyman Nazarian. AB 374, healthcare coverage, do pass as amended per author to use existing prior authorization to form for step therapy, override request. We'll substitute the roll from AB 2, that bill is approved on a 5 to 2 vote with Republicans voting no.
4473	McGuire	Mike	93	msHMXzeLRF8	1378	1390	So that is a huge concern in where I want-- my own personal opinion and I'm not a medical professional. But when we take a look at these kids that are in foster homes, they have faced tremendous trauma.
4474	Hill	Jerry	66	ckveUQ3Zvdc	513	528	Under my bill, a person could walk into a pharmacy and the pharmacist could automatically substitute their prescription for a biologic with an interchangeable biosimilar. The person would pay their copay for the drug, go home, and administer the drug.
4475	Leyva	Connie	62	84LBK3fic7E	1809	1827	I agree with Senator Cannella I would love to see more money, because this does 2 things. It fixes our roads, but it also creates good jobs. Primarily good union jobs. And that helps everybody in all of our committees, so -- or excuse me in all our communities, so I just thank you for your leadership on this and standing strong support. Thank you.
4476	Eggman	Susan Talamantes	73	nsi_dMaCc9g	166	188	I would just say that I appreciate the committee's consideration. This is a very complicated issue, as everybody has pointed out. But certainly our groundwater recharge is one of the most important things that we do, especially with some of the concerns that people have raised, the cost of service water, transfer ,everything that has to occur. We need to be able to recharge our aquifers in a way that makes sense for everybody.
4477	Bonta	Rob	85	q4zBCxFsiaA	91	105	Item number 2, SB. The consent calendar is now at 17-0. Item number 2, SB 4 Senator Lara.  Madam secretary, please call the absent members. Oh, that bill is on call, so we're lifting the call for votes.
4478	Hancock	Loni	98	slpYLwAvmtM	859	890	The motion is to adopt this as trailer bill. As placeholder, trailer bill language. Because there are a number of changes that I believe we will want to make in that. It's a formula, it affects different jurisdictions in different ways. And we need to be very careful about changing that kind of language. So is there a motion to approve as placeholder Trailer Bill language? thank you.
4479	Block	Marty	59	zWeQ21wOnFU	1668	1678	And I think this is one of the things that was kind of constant source of frustration for us on my local school board I know for a lot of other local school board members is constant volatility to our budgeting and the impossibility of being able to plan with any great certainty over a longer period of time.
4480	Thurmond	Tony	4	DrSDPcgi_-A	1594	1611	I got to give a shout out to Bananas because they won't let me come home if I don't, is that there's always been a willingness to have a conversation with us about how we manage the budget. And you talked about all those cuts, Ms. Gabel, what strategy do you think we should be looking at to fund the whole cost for preschool?
4481	Mitchell	Holly	64	L9_yK97Q24w	861	886	I don't at this time. If you recall, Senator Monning this was a part of the request from the Chief Justice a year ago to reduce caseload. It wasn't just for the counsel for children. It was, it was a broad, it was to include parents. And so I can't use that dollar figure alone here and so we, I don't have it yet. Mr. Howard?
4482	Dababneh	Matthew	50	gCJqYiGvi7w	661	674	when they've had some type of privacy breach in the state agency including the DMV. So we all have to be very aware of the security concerns going forward. But I think when you look at the type of technologies out there, we've had a number of stakeholder meetings that I'd be glad to have you come to the next one.
4483	Hertzberg	Robert	99	dElDky5BpW0	294	309	But isn't that doable? I mean, I've looked at that, we do that in the private sector all the time. You just have something, you put in your precinct number or what your address is, and then you print it out. That doesn't seem to me to be very difficult... technologically, we do that all the time in the internet.
4484	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	nJsCwYpjBcE	588	606	First, I want to thank you for bringing this bill. I understand the opposition's concern. I think of those categories as unique statuses, and I think in our society the voluntary decision to put your life on the line, so that we can be safe makes our democracy work.
4485	Leno	Mark	60	EvXJx3b_7-s	1057	1076	So there's quite a bit of room with the other campuses, if we can make it attractive enough for non-residents to be looking at the UC system. So, as I said, it's a difficult place for me to get to, one year.
4486	Weber	Shirley	44	-R2gq2-ns5U	601	610	Those kinds of things that sometimes we take for granted, many communities don't, and they end up finding ourselves with large dental bills and other kinds of things as they go on.
4487	Gomez	Jimmy	80	_NTagRCFfsc	2113	2122	And then that will inform their decision, if this bill moves forward out of the appropriations committee or not. That's just a shot in the dark, maybe that's how it works.
4488	Stone	Jeff	26	uk0vIxtVZmg	239	252	There was this intense liability for these water districts, to get involved and help, and fortunately, they stepped up to the plate, and fortunately, Senator Roth put forward some legislation to indemnify them from any type of litigation.
4489	Dababneh	Matthew	50	BxkG0258XTA	1137	1148	I'm pleased that we have been able to add a variety of protections that are not in current law, including a cost estimate and additional disclosure regarding the cost benefit of using an out-of-network provider.
4490	Ting	Philip	30	sx5Murt3em4	1434	1455	What I'm concerned about is what additional costs are just purely administrative and The fact that you have this, and I don't know if it is blended together or it's all one all separate buckets, but to me I'm really trying to understand what are the actual support staff impacts.
4491	Leno	Mark	60	tqB--Js_f48	2046	2069	Assemblywoman, I'm thinking the exact thoughts that you are. I wanted to see if both Finance and LAO could give me your thoughts on some supplemental reporting language, which would require, and I'm not sure which entity it might be, the Department of Finance,
4492	Stone	Mark	20	7UN1Ta_jlck	1110	1130	There are a lot of stakeholders who are concerned and who are watching this, because change is not easy. And to be able to move the natural need, or the natural demand for group homes, move those kids out into more home base setting is something that is critical for us to do at this point. That's what
4493	Hill	Jerry	66	nZHmIMh0aaI	1545	1572	So without any further comments, we will adjourn today's hearing on the Commission reviews and the sunset reviews, and we'll reestablish the hearing on Monday and for the Joint Hearing at 9 AM in room 4203 which is right here. So, the sunset review hearings will continue Monday morning, 9 AM, in 4203 here.
4494	Gomez	Jimmy	80	11yyICoQ5m8	1263	1274	Because when they're given the choice they understand that the child will continue to, maybe, live and be taken care of, but the quality of the bonding is not gonna be there if they don't take that time off.
4495	Daly	Tom	118	gf6xiaI75uY	30	51	Under current law, detached accessory structures are not assessed, and the goal of AB 715 is to ensure that a bike storage is not assessed as habitable space. Similarly, walkways are not currently assessable space. And my bill states that putting a cover on that walkway should not change that outcome.
4496	Beall	Jim	92	7aIanLUJ17E	96	116	Okay, thank you. Other witnesses? Other witnesses in support. Opposition? Witnesses in opposition. Questions of the offer from our committee. Any questions? Well we don't have a quorum yet, so we'll have to wait until we have a quorum. And thank you.
4497	Allen	Benjamin	70	m25jL11Z0rE	69	94	And we kind of formulated the idea of this legislation which includes creating management care guides for Alzheimer's and dementia. So it's estimated that today 590,000 Californians have Alzheimer's disease. This is complex and costly disease. It rages in it's victims for about seven to ten years. There is no known cure.
4498	Hueso	Ben	48	MFaUCCPTn6I	685	726	Thank you. I want to ask you take-- attempt to answer question that I ask prior about how it's possible for one producer to basically-- because of an incident at their refinery and their obligation to continue to supply can cause an increase in the prices everywhere else, when the amount of oil or the amount of gas that was previously being produced is continuing-- it's still be produced.
4499	Garcia	Eduardo	38	jcqm9XlDQYM	667	686	Senate Bill 27 takes a comprehensive approach to the issue. Amendments in the last few days have been taken that has removed opposition from many of the organizations, such as Natural Resources Defense Council and Center for Food and Safety and many others.
4500	De Leon	Kevin	102	Gcdptg51L2I	1900	1916	Now also want to thank our new Republican leader. A new Republican leader, my partner on the Rules Committee, we have served together since our SAB days, State Allocation Board, in the California State Assembly, and I'm looking forward to working with you as well as our colleagues in the GOP here in the Senate.
4501	Pavley	Fran	104	YrZrpwtmLSQ	1563	1577	Many of those teachers were younger and didn't go back into the public school system, once they left they moved on. We have another problem. The baby boomers are retiring. My generation is retiring in droves.
4502	Grove	Shannon	77	adewtR6e1X4	936	947	just recently the Supreme Court ruled that we could have access to all of the abuse records that took place. We have a huge, monumental failure that I don't want to backfill.
4503	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	gunU8ZfZPfs	392	404	AB 266 along with AB to 234 and SB 643 creates a regulatory system that respects the interests of the local government, while still providing a consistent state-wide structure. I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
4504	Roth	Richard	106	Ty0_iZ3tnjo	157	172	It requires local building departments to provide business permit applicants with information about ADA access requirements and requires that those permits be expedited when the business owner is attempting to fix ADA access issues.
4505	Hertzberg	Robert	99	uprCp-AfCts	637	644	We're trying to deal with this kind of on the run, I wanted just to add that in, and if you have anything further I wanted to get your thoughts on that.
4506	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	gunU8ZfZPfs	374	392	Mr. Speaker, I must commend Senator McGuire for helping to move comprehensive medical cannabis regulation, he has been a dedicated advocate for his constituents, this measure has been crafted to create a balance, everyone is not happy, but we have tried to create a system that will allow many to legally participate in this industry.
4507	Gomez	Jimmy	80	NEf6zh-NPIY	1975	1993	There is no guarantee that you will come back to that job. There's no job protection for you to come back. So, that's something you still have to work out with your employer, but they don't have to take you back. They are not covered under that particular law.
4508	Leno	Mark	60	l1HWjxTN3mM	79	103	There have been some new stories in the past year that have indicated that there are mandatory parental volunteer hours at some of these schools, minimum English proficiencies and a certain GPA for admission. These discriminatory policies harm students of color often, and also students from low-income families.
4509	Harper	Matthew	14	oXhYdSan_zc	3	142	So at this time, we're still waiting for the author of the final item on the calendar, which is SB 3, and so we'll go ahead and wait until the author is here or the chair is here. Over here, Senator. Last man standing.
4510	Bates	Pat	58	y2dm_Q__xog	1289	1314	Because I think the accountability that the public is asking for really enhances democracy and this is an opportunity for people to really be more participatory in their government at every level. Cuz many don't understand that the commissions and committees that give us recommendations, very very important and very impactful and we hope that's a positive impact and they have an opportunity to really engage.
4511	Holden	Chris	78	Sai1lZPOK9g	541	573	In an issue like this, and I conferred with those who brought the issue to me, it became very difficult to do that, recognizing what they were trying to accomplish and what we were trying to help them accomplish. But I will say that, in closing, I appreciate your giving this consideration, hearing the concerns, giving it our best effort to try to be responsive to the judicial process and how it would work through that process.
4512	Atkins	Toni	110	ymi21hh5WVg	2034	2060	Practically, how do you address issues in people's lives so that they can respect the inheritance of things that are passed on. I've pledged to continue to work on these issues and I will as long as we can follow federal law that we are not creating a further heavier burden in terms of a system that makes it even harder.
4513	Stone	Mark	20	f1-nJuHExxE	1748	1757	And I think the checks and balances you put in this bill are very, very appropriate, and that is why the recommendation is do pass to appropriations. We do have the motion and second.
4514	Beall	Jim	92	xvcU4IJP8VQ	728	758	That if they can pass a half cent sales tax and use the money for the maintenance deficit they will be able to get a one time additional funding from a fund created in this. To incentivize them to pass the half cent sales tax. We've gone since the early 80s on the half cent sale tax.
4515	Bates	Pat	58	h0Gkdxuepz8	1923	1948	Do we have anything that presents a best practice as a model, and is there a rule for the accreditation process to include that as individuals decide to, you know, develop private non-profit or for-profit schools like this, because, they are an essential component, in education of the new worker.
4516	Hertzberg	Robert	99	E_gAhll2czw	185	228	Members of quorum is present. Would the members and our guests beyond the rail and in the gallery please rise? We will be led in prayer this morning by our chaplain, Sister Michelle Gorman, after which please remain standing. We will be led in the pledge of allegiance to the flag by Senator Connie Leyva.
4517	Bonta	Rob	85	37JGlYuk31E	754	772	Every child deserves to be able to go to school in a safe and healthy environment. The parents' right to make healthcare decisions for their child is not entirely boundless, and without limitation. It must take into consideration the effect those decisions have on our neighbors, and others in the community.
4518	Grove	Shannon	77	kWtMirkLI5M	1161	1172	And so although I appreciate my colleagues' comments I have to completely 100% disagree with them that it is time that we all take a stand for the people that are sitting out there in the wheelchairs and that are up in that balcony because
4519	Grove	Shannon	77	kWtMirkLI5M	1146	1161	We need to put and prioritize the people with developmental disabilities first and foremost, and let those people who write those checks stand in the back, because the bottom line is, is that we need to protect the developmental community in the community.
4520	Eggman	Susan Talamantes	73	X5ZwfIJ2xIA	1162	1192	And that's the idea that he brought that we're all part of the same thing. If we live in the same country, the same state, the same community we are bound by what happens to each person. He provided four basic steps when you're going to think about organizing something. One, collect the facts to assess of injustice, simply does it occur? Is it real? Is there injustice? If you can say yes to that, then you try to negotiate peacefully. You try to negotiate how can we change this? How can we engage with this to make things better for people?
4521	Hancock	Loni	98	dv1TuQD9iKk	1714	1726	Thank you very much. There is a growing concern about the military equipment that the Federal Government has been giving many local law enforcement agencies. That is very very much a concern. Thank you.
4522	Allen	Benjamin	70	7zfeQPMxSJ4	196	209	So it's my belief that given both the current water crisis and also the almost inevitable trajectory of the water crisis moving forward, not only on the medium term but on the long term.
4523	Leno	Mark	60	KRvT4-vnFFc	1669	1689	Thank you, Mr. Brown. Very comprehensive and succinct. We appreciate that. I want to thank the Governor and the Department of Finance for your responsiveness to a letter that the Democratic caucus and the Senate had sent to you about a month or so ago.
4524	Fuller	Jean	49	9celf0om_Bo	1441	1462	I guess I'm just not completely sure on the rules of about this, but like if he wants to use those Committee bills, but one of the caucus committee advisors doesn't want him to use one of those bills, he can go ahead anyway, can't he? I thought he could. No? When does it-
4525	Hernandez	Ed	103	GBu0gthuabo	770	800	And I believe that this bill that we're both gonna be running together, myself and the Chair of the Assembly of Health, at least has to start that conversation of how we're gonna get that same care and that same access to that vulnerable population. But maybe what we should do, and then I'm gonna have a second question in a little bit, is maybe what we should do is start looking at how do we creatively incentivize providers to go to those particular areas?
4526	Bonilla	Susan	3	ASNmI2rHU9I	907	927	Is there any other significant difference between the already public information and I, and I, I think there is an opportunity to make all of those filings much more transparent, accessible and meaningful, to us here in California.
4527	Mullin	Kevin	31	GV2uLrBMX6U	565	603	Members, if we could have your attention. Moving to business on the daily file. There's no business on the daily file. We're moving to adjournments in memories and announcements. Request to adjourn in  memory. The following members were granted prior permission to speak on an adjournment in memory. Thank you, members. Ms. Gaines, you are recognized at your desk for your adjournment in memory.
4528	Alejo	Luis	9	iF8zLPAheNg	221	243	So you had employers all over our state, especially those in agriculture, who are following what the Department of Industrial Relation, the labor commissioner's office was instructing them to do in their manuals, in their training, in the guidelines, of how to properly calculate piece-rate pay that included times such as not productive time into the overall calculation
4529	Nielsen	Jim	68	ZKJUzc_ClWA	234	249	If I may offer, Senator Stone, if you'd wave the motion for now, and if I might ask the chair for an indulgence to allow me to put the bill over. Just what I'm hearing from committee members, I've got some ideas on a couple of possibilities.
4530	Leno	Mark	60	GObd4JWklwI	1786	1823	Three zero, three zero. Page five is the IMD clarification, Institutes for Mental Disease and we have another conference compromise. This one adopts modified trailer bill language to clarify responsibility of a regional setter when a consumer is placed in an IMD, regardless of who makes the placement.
4531	Wolk	Lois	94	eibZ1b56Plc	959	974	You know. There's a, I remember staffers telling me at Governance and Finance, there was a time that no one would even consider late opposition like this. But not all our traditions have remained, so I move the bill.
4532	Hernandez	Ed	103	GMJQ-TfW0Eo	1507	1536	I agree that we need to look at data, data is extremely important.  Whether it's data in the Department to manage healthcare, data DHCA's, Department of Health. And, yes it's very important we have this aggregated data especially amongst the API community to look at the different subgroups and very important how we collect the data, but it's also what do we do with the data and more importantly and these are the questions I'm going to ask the Administration is where do we house the data and who's responsible for that data.
4533	Leno	Mark	60	JK2AAP7nJZs	1643	1660	a prosecutor has acted intentionally and in bad faith. That's a very high bar, intentionally and in bad faith by withholding evidence of innocence and such a withholding has resulted in a wrongful conviction. Secondly, it strengthens the authority of a court to disqualify
4534	Hill	Jerry	66	20R5DjZ86C8	830	846	I would have thought that, we would have settled that issue of how to set an appropriate pipeline pressure but there appears to be more confusion today then ever. What I would like to know is, is this a safety concern? What does Ora think the Commission should do about this?
4535	Harper	Matthew	14	AW7ZOJRT_Sc	1421	1443	Plastic bag ban will also likely kill several hundred manufacturing jobs within the State of California. Despite the loan in the bill many existing factories won't be able to switch and start making reusable bags. Repealing the bag band will protect these jobs and prevent any self inflicted wounds two are very tenuous economy.
4536	McGuire	Mike	93	gqFKPQ41Jk4	1253	1279	And I wanted to get to that and I think this is. And again, I know you've only been there a year. So I wanna put that in context, right? Yeah. So, while not a perfect process, if an individual is able to go to their local City Council and Board of Supervisors and comment on a rape case, they're most likely going to be listened to.
4537	Bonta	Rob	85	pab-ZAwjcmA	235	259	These Filipino leaders successfully asked the mostly Latino Farm Workers Union, the National Farmers Association, led by Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta, to join the strike. The Filipinos voting in that hall 50 years ago likely did not realize how their vote would change the world.
4538	Allen	Travis	43	hnhklV-igrA	1081	1098	It was a live vaccine, it multiplied more than they would want it to and so that was a bad reaction to that vaccine and then when I saw that child, the second child, I would want to make sure that that child does not have severe combined immune deficiency syndrome before I gave them that type of vaccine and I can test for that.
4539	Hueso	Ben	48	LVzFkfmZq9U	1133	1151	This would mean an enormous beneficial impact to California's economy. In one instance, they estimated that reducing border wait times by an hour would create, would increase California's economy by $7,000,000,000 annually.
4540	Beall	Jim	92	PFemgtd0i88	1006	1030	And what the number of hours that we put in here is based on evidence-based practices the experts have determined, what would be the number of hours needed to properly train the people that work in law enforcement in their communities. So, they kind of, this is not a new subject, it just didn't come out of the air.
4541	Rendon	Anthony	120	aAhB2ce4YDU	2	27	Good afternoon. I'd like to convene the Utilities and Commerce Committee. We're going to start as a sub-committee. Sergeant Sergeant, please call the absent members. We're gonna consider 14 assembly bills today. AB 1005 has been pulled. Let's begin with Mr. Garcia
4542	Quirk	Bill	23	2vYcwmo23_E	1142	1160	Thank you Professor Eberhardt. We'll now go on to the third panel. That panel is going to focus on balancing the interests of transparency. Those of privacy of both the public and the police officers, certainly something we've already heard a fair amount about today.
4543	Holden	Chris	78	-R4HGT4UbOs	2064	2082	Coach Tarkanian was one of the winningest basketball coaches but he was also a coach that taught the game; he was a teacher. And as you know, the metaphors around sports, when you teach about sports in winning, you're also teaching about life and winning.
4544	McGuire	Mike	93	XPGU1ygzzfg	746	762	Now I'd like to be able to introduce Gail Johnson-Vaughn. She's the Executive Director of Families Now. Ms. Johnson-Vaughn is going to describe the core elements of effective mental health services for foster youth and we're very grateful that you're hear today. Thank you so much. It's good to see you.
4545	Garcia	Cristina	112	1O51OMdLA-4	834	854	due to mitigation efforts and delays. This bill gives OPR the authority to determine the transportation impacts including those measured by BMT, do not meet the threshold of significance for residential and mixed use projects within transit priority areas. This version of the bill addresses the concerns of those who were opposed of
4546	Williams	Das	12	HnRJwGFV_5U	196	218	There are several reasons why this bill does not go through LAFCO, or why a CSD should not go through LAFCO. First, it was specifically requested to not do so because of the emergency nature of the problem. Secondly, creating, a CSD through legislation allows us flexibility with the board makeup.
4547	Monning	Bill	25	-8HmkVu5hs8	1943	1960	Following up on Senator Leno's question on medical exemption, if a doctor did not grant a medical exemption is the family free to seek a second opinion from another physician?
4548	Galgiani	Cathleen	95	OYxOD7KdZAI	1586	1630	And I will say as someone who worked for John Garamendi maybe 22 years ago, I hold a very fond place in my heart for Mary Jane Garamendi because while she always had a very, very busy household and lots of family around, I had the good fortune of spending a week with her when we were planning something in that area and she was the most loving, kind, warm woman who would open her home to anyone and take you so your family member yourself. So, it is with deep respect and admiration that I rise to adjourn in memory of Mary Jane Garamendi.
4549	Calderon	Ian Charles	115	KTS25NPAjyE	1274	1300	This bill requires written informed consent given by patients, institutional review board oversight by physician recommendations, and biannual reports to the Department of Public Health to ensure safety for both patients and physicians. AB 159 is simple, if yourself, a parent or a child are faced with a terminal illness, then there is a process in place for you to seek potentially life saving treatments.

So if there's an agency that is abusing eminent domain or not following the goals of the community, there's accountability because they could be shut down by a vote of the people, and originally the bill would do it after a certain amount of time.
4551	Atkins	Toni	110	CY8dWb1-gXw	1978	2002	I want to thank you Mr. Chairman. I have to say I couldn't disagree more that there are no criteria or guidelines. The Franchise Tax Board is an entity that does work, and already addresses and oversees the R&D Credit Program. We are talking about a small program, specifically to try to increase economic activity and entrepreneurship.
4552	Patterson	Jim	119	vYqU_TjNJ4I	550	561	Joining me here to help send that signal that yes, California is open for business is Ken DeVore from National Federation of Independent Businesses, and he will discuss the benefits, as a witness.
4553	Gallagher	James	108	g465sM88Jms	2223	2242	eah, but I mean, aren't we creating a sort of an unequal playing field when we, you know, are going after this sector of the industry. And that sector of the industry does include family owned businesses, they may be large but they are still family owned. They're not private equity firms that own these companies.
4554	Atkins	Toni	110	CoRx3ywt_ws	141	160	Specifically the bill authorizes eligible businesses to receive a grant of 15% of the credits generated starting in 2016. The bill also allows a two year look back period for which small businesses can receive a grant for 10% of all tax credits received in 2014 and 2015.
4555	Allen	Travis	43	R3SMzNAvRKs	261	273	What sort of legislative oversight would be with your bill or is this something you'd be looking to do a follow-on bill maybe next year to actually have some legislative oversight of this new regulatory body.
4556	Ting	Philip	30	R3SMzNAvRKs	273	287	Well there's no question, just to answer the my colleague from Hunington Beach's question, is that there's no question that we need more oversight. So this bill actually doesn't create another agency. It just creates and codifies rules that this non-profit organization needs to operate.
4557	Pavley	Fran	104	zYzr-HEEMIA	922	947	Thank you very much for your testimony. Sorry I interrupted you in the middle. Anyone wishing ... Just a second, let me get through that and then we'll open it up for questions of the key witnesses. Anyone wishing to add their name and position of opposition, just for the record.  There's no time for..
4558	Pan	Richard	96	Pt2Dhj6vkoE	574	609	I also just want to briefly also remark that as someone who has a science background I know that here as we've debated policy, we need to have, be competitive and be able to recruit scientists to help us do the work, to provide the technical support for state government and I appreciate what the administration, the scientists, were able to come together, and same with their engineers, to try to be sure we remain competitive, because we've, you know, been in situations where basically, the private sector and the public sector and many levels of government and other levels of government have been more competitive than the state.
4559	Pavley	Fran	104	Ab32yuFXwvM	1101	1126	DOGGR's existing personnel have identified over 2,500 wells. And now, according to Monday's paper, I find out what I need to know by reading the paper, an additional 3,600 wells have been identified that need to be further reviewed by the Water Board because they maybe too near, or non-exempt aquifers, possibly endangering our dwindling water supply.
4560	Stone	Jeff	26	OHqd1YALBQA	951	973	We're going to possibly thirteen dollars an hour which brings up to about 27,000 dolalrs and I would argue that still a poverty wage and I have been extremely excited about serving on committees here and as many of you know, this is my first term in the Legislature and I want to do what I can to lift people out of poverty.
4561	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	Oggr1OKYFzQ	1152	1178	Thank you. Others in support? Alright, seeing none. Witnesses in opposition, if you'd step forward, please. We need to make room for a couple, just two or three people? How many people do we have, two? Alright. Okay. Good evening.
4562	Garcia	Cristina	112	ZmQN_cLb26Y	20	34	Thank you. In 2012, the legislature approved AB 1670 by Senator Lara, which amended probate code to remove the long standing prohibition against non resident heir beneficiaries being able to nominate persons they trusted.
4563	Holden	Chris	78	Sai1lZPOK9g	384	406	I would, I really do appreciate your comments. I appreciate all of your comments. I think that they have been thoughtful. They have been reflective of the work ability of some of the aspects of the bill. And I understand how that would float to the top and you would zero in on the areas that you have.
4564	Wolk	Lois	94	7ULUe19PTjQ	480	496	All right. Thank you. Further concerns or opposition? All right. Seeing none. We do not have a quorum, but perhaps when, I know when we do there will be a motion. The recommendation I believe is do pass as amended to approps?
4565	Chu	Kansen	32	c2oYV5XOPiQ	481	498	Any other bills to lift? No. Okay. All right, so, are you going to read out the bill or they can add on? Okay, why don't you read out the bill?
4566	McGuire	Mike	93	a71Txrj65NA	646	669	And a 6.5% reduction in youth consumption. It's clear price point moves the needle towards a healthier California. It has been 16 years since California last raised its tobacco tax. And during that time, we've seen our states cost of providing health care for those inflicted with a tobacco-related disease increase significantly.
4567	Pan	Richard	96	Zk_K_zhn8-Q	1372	1394	I guess, it's just the taxpayers a little frustrated that why are we, you know, so, under funding when and where, where is the money going? And I guess that's uh.  Okay, maybe I'll make that, leave that as rhetorical then and we'll drill into this later on.
4568	Thurmond	Tony	4	myyM8i0TuNI	244	259	Thank you, simply a thank you to the author. We're also interested in the issue of school-based mental health and we've introduced a bill that would also establish a pilot, but not necessarily in any specific grade, throughout all K-12.
4569	Williams	Das	12	v8nsxSPxdAk	1131	1145	I also want to offer to the author that in the research that we've been doing, one of the big impediments for many communities is resident's time with some of the kind of projects that you're thinking about.
4570	Maienschein	Brian	84	WYVxOJwtXj8	1861	1876	Witnesses in support? Witnesses in opposition? Questions or comments from the committee? Do we have a motion? Motion Mr. Holden, second from Ms. Waldron. Mr. Allen, you may close.
4571	Pan	Richard	96	-zapzAXTnLg	554	573	President to work to try to come to a solution so we can get past, and correct the wrongs of our current system, which is not working. So, hopefully we will not only pass this resolution, there's a package of bills that was announced that we will also show our action on those so that
4572	Stone	Jeff	26	perI44B8dbA	735	746	Okay. I won't be able to support your bill today. I look forward to you working with the opponents, and hopefully when we get to the floor I'll be in a position to support your bill.
4573	Hernandez	Ed	103	CdKj6oLMa4k	1415	1434	So, I believe very strongly in the success of the Affordable Care Act and the minimum standard of the 60%. And I definitely believe that employers should not, or anyone, should try to dumb it down, skinny it up, or junk insurance or whatever.
4574	Block	Marty	59	Ig90uId0Xro	1591	1601	Okay, let me ask staff. The main difference between the Governor's proposal and staff proposal is how the money is distributed? Is that to whom and how it's distributed?
4575	Bonta	Rob	85	5xYY96cBqDg	813	838	We wanted to explore other options that included collaborations, private deals, including Sutter. What was on the table and what was discussed, we had to re-review some of the The hospital financials and see what was needed. And as we came to the end of this year and those options did not play out and did not come to fruition, we had one more option left.
4576	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	HgBIr1hupMw	245	271	So that this proposal, this suggestion or ask, if you will, is not without precedent. Within our general proposal of increasing slots and modernizing rates we focused our request on the following. Increasing reimbursement rates for license exempt care providers. These provider rates must be fair and accurately reflect the cost of providing that care.
4577	Mullin	Kevin	31	ch3qK2_FbyA	1763	1798	aye vote. Mr. Holden is asking for a no vote. Members this is procedural. Majority those present and voting. Clerk will open the roll. Mr. Holden is asking for a no vote,  Mr. Jones is asking for an aye vote. Mr. Holden is asking for no vote on the appeal a decision of the chair, Mr. Jones is asking for an aye vote. Clerk will close the roll. Ayes 21, noes 48. That appeal fails. The chair's ruling is sustained.
4578	Chau	Ed	116	vXz2QoNROUo	677	700	Thank you very much and I do have a couple of folow up questions as well. On the Keeping Home California program, it's my understanding that if the $1.8 billion are not used up, or not distributed by 2017, the remainder of the balance will be returned to the federal government. Do you foresee that we're on track to distributing the entire amount?
4579	Cannella	Anthony	61	AtEtvEwPM9c	553	577	Appreciate your patience. All right so Mr. Cooley are you then? Phillip Chow was next on the list. I think he left so please come on up. And again, in the interest of time, two minutes for two people in support, two minutes for two people in opposition and then me too. So, thank you, sir.
4580	Williams	Das	12	oE98JCD72Xk	1755	1779	You know, obviously people who live in apartments need more charging infrastructure than people who have single family homes. Right. If we are going to promulgate electrification and we are gonna need the help of the utilities to do that, and the quandary I think the author is facing is how to do that and still have the pioneers of the industry have, be able to continue what they're doing as well.
4581	Allen	Benjamin	70	IQPza6hTge0	162	185	Some of you heard yesterday from a mother, Nina, whose friend can not be vaccinated. She's returned to my district but her story was for her search for a public school with a high immunization rate that her son could attend. Her story is not hers alone, nor are the stories that many of you have told in this room. All these stories and these lives along with the ones that we don't hear are the reason why we're all here today.
4582	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	B4ry1_3tU0U	1421	1434	And we were saying, how can this be possible? Didn't we pass a law? Well there was a loophole, because we said it was an act of Congress not executive order. So I'm sorry that there are unscrupulous attorneys, I am.
4583	Allen	Benjamin	70	IQPza6hTge0	186	214	Now Senator Pan and I present amendments today that we think strikes a balance for allowing folks like Nina to find a school for her son and for those who firmly do not want to vaccinate their children. While this is a balance with these two factions, it's also a balance for the authors who both deeply believe that everyone should vaccinate a child who doesn't have a medical concern because it makes it safer for them and for all of us. While this bill won't reach everyone, it will increase everyone's safety against vaccine preventable diseases.
4584	Hill	Jerry	66	KoF0I8ZWJLM	119	134	This allowed them to use the fields year round, save water, save money, among other benefits. But not all turf fields are made from the same materials. Many companies offer organic and non-toxic turf alternatives, instead of crumb rubber from waste tires. and non-toxic turf alternatives instead of crumb rubber from waste tires.
4585	Allen	Benjamin	70	vE1aI3Q_hng	896	930	And the final thing I'll say is that unlike in the case of Serrano v. Priest and all of the situations that you're talking about that involve distinctions that are difficult to get out of, people in this case, we're talking about a choice that's been made by a parent not to vaccinate. It's not an inherent quality that exists in all of the Civil Rights discrimination legislation and litigation that that Serono was a part of. Including the wealth distinction.
4586	Bonilla	Susan	3	HBOX_ihiZFg	410	424	Where you're losing people who are qualified. Who are working in the field. Who have a passion to provide these services, and it's very critical that we understand the uniqueness of our work force.
4587	Chau	Ed	116	gTAQdo8pMME	102	120	I'd like to start by welcoming everyone to this joint oversight hearing of the Assembly Committees on Housing and Community Development and Veterans Affairs on the implementation of the Veterans Housing and Homeless Prevention program, also known as VHHP.
4588	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	emhy9UKtKg0	2059	2072	All right. The vote count is 5-1 that bill is out. File item 11 was pulled. File item 12 AB 999 by Assemblymember Daly, the vote count is 4-0. The Chair hear voting aye. Please call the absent members.
4589	Cooper	Jim	21	BgYBPlfYhOQ	1829	1841	In this day and age I just have a hard time believing you guys have never been hit because if you guys are that good, then you should help the federal government out, and everybody else. So I'm just somewhat skeptical about that, just knowing how these type of things work.
4590	Thurmond	Tony	4	6jHkP5bxQA4	876	921	Were doing a lot of mathematics here today. The other thing that you remind me of, we always talked when we were in local government about the multiplier effect, every single dollar that we invested usually generated you know three more dollars, $4, $5, and I think it's important to talk about it in those terms too. California's making an investment and by investing in our children we're investing in our state. Who's going to bring this argument? I mean we'll all going to bring it, but who are the groups that we should be working with. I don't know who's introduced the bills on rates, but obviously this seems to me like that should be the language, that we're not just asking for money. We're saying that this is an investment that's gonna continue to yield even more investment.
4591	Hill	Jerry	66	VFoe5hvDs-o	1200	1217	Very good, thank you, Mr. Hernandez. Others in support? Are there witnesses in opposition? Seeing no one, bringing it back to the committee. Questions, I appreciate you agreeing to take the amendments that we've talked about in appropriations or on the floor before.
4592	Gordon	Richard	117	0hkCdiDRiI0	2138	2153	AB 339 improves on their efforts to provide protections for the 23 million Californians with coverage not provided through Covered California. As California has implemented the Affordable Care Act, time and time again, we have done better than what is required by Federal law.
4593	Rendon	Anthony	120	ohOGzwAGjR4	1672	1682	Thank you. Now it's at this point, let's just hear from support witnesses. Just please name your, give your name, affiliation, and the fact that you support the bill.
4594	Hancock	Loni	98	Laqdju9yTYg	10	43	Thank you Madame Chair and welcome Mr. Secretary. We appreciate your coming here and giving us an update about how far you are along in this project and you give the April 2015 as a date that you're going to be implementing this same full board to all the affected institutions.
4595	Bonilla	Susan	3	kGJrWtDlyMM	1831	1849	The LAO projects there will be over $1 billion in one time Prop 98 monies available in the May revise. And we believe that with that money and also a survey conducted by the Association of California School Administrators, there is a continued need at the local level for this funding.
4596	Dababneh	Matthew	50	eYvHQ6iO6CE	314	334	This is obviously a difficult decision and most decisions on this committee are. We're all struggling to make sure we strike the right balance. I will say in response to the consumer advocate groups, I appreciate their work. I appreciate their comments today. I appreciate their suggestions.
4597	Gatto	Mike	46	0KJVRFCFgZY	754	773	I am waiving all the suspense Mr. Chairman. I know that feeling well. I'm presenting assembly bill 605, which is a concerned protection measure. My understanding is it was pulled off consent by the gentleman from Orange County, who misses the sound of my voice. And he's reading his phone and didn't even hear that joke.
4598	Gipson	Mike	28	r0_c68VZXFY	1039	1056	Thank you very much, Mr. Vice-Chair. Again, this resolution, with all due respect, talks about, we cannot move forward unless we reflect back on our past, and what came out of this revolt was great things.
4599	Stone	Mark	20	7UN1Ta_jlck	1280	1296	But, it's worth doing and that's what we're trying to do. We're working with the 10 counties that do have shelters, trying to find a way that those shelters are not perpetuating the kinds of harms that have happened to kids there. That they are productive, and that they are still working towards outcomes and,
4600	Chau	Ed	116	g595lZYQYE0	2347	2357	So, all the, all the measure does is to require the additional statement saying that whether or not, you know, the condo is, you know, FHA approved, for example.
4601	Kim	Young	82	ZQqDgc40U1M	85	103	With this bill, low income parents would save precious time and money and prevent a lengthy court battle, by letting the county office of education weigh in on whether the local education agency acted in good faith and followed the law.
4602	Beall	Jim	92	nJXs6pD2ors	1391	1408	I was kind of puzzled by this Medi-Cal comment because in our county all the managed healthcare programs in Medi-Cal do eye examinations for all the kids. So they're already done, so I don't know what the cost number, is it the issue you're raising?
4603	Mendoza	Tony	52	r1L5ziee2-s	254	284	The immunization records will be reviewed during regular licensing inspections along with other required records such as tuberculosis screening results. This bill will protect children who are too young to be vaccinated. And with me today to testify is Erica Pan a doctor and she's a director for the Division of Communicable Diseases and Control and Prevention, and deputy health officer for the Alameda County Public Health Department and a pediatric infection disease specialist.
4604	Fuller	Jean	49	c9mBAjkLpP8	420	466	Today I have with me the Office of Economic Adjustment Director Patrick O'brien.  Patrick, want to wave?  Thank you, so they know. And the Office of Economic Adjustment Community Investment Program Manager Nia Hope, Nia. To answer any questions you may have related to the Department of Defense Grant Program which is called OEA. We also have only the OEA Western Regional Office Director Gary Kuwabara. I'm going to get it right yet. And, Superintendent Candace Singh, is Candace, no? She's on her way. With Fallbrook Unified Elementary School. Many of these, most of these schools are not in my district, by the way.
4605	Roth	Richard	106	-1v9avmnxCY	1607	1621	But, the study's not required unless you disagree with the requirements of the bill and if as a city you disagree with the requirements of the bill because you think additional parking is required, then you would need the study to support your decision.
4606	Dahle	Brian	47	LoBHmtPnzP4	1139	1160	And that's a long question, I understand, but it's really the crux of I think where we head as policy makers in California to make the right decisions. So that we can actually manage the portfolio in a way that, and I think there is a disconnect between the constituents that we represent.
4607	Bonta	Rob	85	doJlNdYlHmM	890	909	But that's why I prefer the negotiation process cause you can more creative, you can reach out and address other issues as you put together the package. Unfortunately, we haven't been able to do that up to this point and we have a deadline. We put this over a week to continue negations and we met during that inner room period. And as I said we are also open to continue to talk and I feel I have good relationships with both sides,
4608	Gallagher	James	108	7UN1Ta_jlck	216	240	Thank you, Mr. Speaker, members. I'm proud to present AB 1061. Currently the state owns fee title easements and land use agreements on about 18,000 parcels of land as part of the state plan flood control. However, even though these funds are generated by the flood project lands, under current law, this revenue goes to the general fund.
4609	Garcia	Cristina	112	95pquWUVfBw	741	755	As a woman I want to know that I have multiple options to make that decision for myself along the way of what I do and I don't think that the statement reads in such a way you are advocating or saying that this is a better choice than something else.
4610	De Leon	Kevin	102	aItBzVMycEU	1672	1700	So those are the main components right there. Now with regards to the fuel content specifications, obviously it's about the carbon icing, if you will gas. Now, a tank of gasoline, a gallon of gasoline or tank of gas, obviously it's 90 to 95% oil petroleum based. What we're asking for is a tiny modest fraction, a tiny modest fraction if you will with regards to bio fuels.
4611	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	5jUUOwMdhxk	960	968	I'd be happy to continue this conversation, hopefully as this bill moves forward with all of you who have expressed concern, but I respectfully ask for your aye vote today.
4612	Hancock	Loni	98	rb93slzi3ec	1745	1770	I know that it's the goal. I'm just trying to figure out what the bill also says. I guess my question is, why wouldn't you want to know what happened under a prior petition if you had a child that was being seen again?
4613	Beall	Jim	92	XxAKuU0JQuk	1360	1392	I had a question about the universe of people that you look at when you look at the pros and cons. And have you examined how this impacts retirees specifically? Say, this proposal went to the issue of retirees versus employees. Are you looking at, as a universe, employees, active employees, retirees, or both when you studied this particular aspect?
4614	Mathis	Devon	75	IEHFBfAx3rE	1212	1239	We have amendments to add co-authors, and I'd also like to be added as primary co-author, principle co-author, as well, and motion due pass as amended of the purpose of adding co-authors. Co-authors are Brough and Brown, do I have a motion?
4615	Salas	Rudy	34	w_O6rMiIuwc	1575	1612	Thank you. Thank you Chairwoman for bringing this. I remember this item from last year as well. Mr. Contay had spoken about the Strike Teams as well, and I just wanted to ask a question as to the 5.6 that we are allocating here. I do understand under statue in 2009, we do allow up to 11 million, but under the current proposal we have 5.6, which is great but how is that divided up? Because I remember in last year's budget three million was from general fund. And then another portion of that was for the Strike Teams, so for this 5.6, how is that exactly broken up or are we done with the Strike Teams? Is that still continuing?
4616	Chavez	Rocky	83	Hi5Vq6PdNIY	119	130	So, from your understanding what are we going to be doing in this bottom-up review with cost drivers and activities. What do you think we're going to be doing?
4617	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	vPceAWe-pfQ	1194	1207	On a slightly different note, I am kind of curious, last year we extended, I think it was last year or the year before, where we extended FEHA harassment protections to interns and volunteers.
4618	Allen	Benjamin	70	acGD7CpLfyI	436	448	We've got, actually two panelists from other counties to talk about the San Diego County experience, Michael Vu, and Ben Hamatake who is from Orange County Office of the Registrar of Voters.
4619	Lara	Ricardo	107	jMZO7dgahk8	1054	1072	No file. Comments or questions from Committee? Seeing and hearing none, without objection, we move this item to the suspense file. Members, this concludes our meeting for today. We will be very popular on Thursday. And we have lots of work to do between now and Thursday. So, thank you, members, for joining us today. This concludes our meeting.
4620	Lara	Ricardo	107	alaNgMhEeC8	1933	1957	And just echoing Mr. Micheli's comments. You know, we're currently -- the majority of restaurant owners in California are small business owners, and that's not taking into consideration a lot of the time we're currently just in the midst of going through a 25 percent increase in labor costs with the minimum wage increase, only part of which has taken place so far.
4621	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	MVCeSI-m6QA	547	578	Thank you, and as our esteemed Vice Chair of the legislative black caucus observed, Debbie Manning is also a woman. So on behalf of the Legislative Women's Caucus, I too want to stand and congratulate her on being the first woman sergeant-at-arms and I went to tell a little story about Debbie Manning that many of us, the other women here today, will I think appreciate as will many of the women surrounding us.
4622	Nguyen	Janet	65	YNjNXr0cQTo	550	582	And these are the individuals who most likely don't speak English well. Most likely, maybe not even be able to whether read or write in English well or even in their own language. So if you're gonna do anything how do we get to these individuals to get them to know their rights and also to make sure they still have a job? And so the balance of both is extremely important. And so again thank you for the opportunity to be here.
4623	Dababneh	Matthew	50	tC7sJemEjBU	1410	1420	That has always been left up to the Universities to decide. There's never been any type of outside involvement or outside administrative review. This has always been left to the universities.
4624	Nielsen	Jim	68	fPXDsUW3HWg	414	430	Well, we have had an opportunity to find out about it if we would have time for exhaustive hearings, lengthy hearings. This should be a many-hour, many-day hearing in a policy committee, if not a couple of policy committees.
4625	Hernandez	Ed	103	V40hlwpKzww	46	71	As you know, we have a shortage of positions here in California. Study after study, highlights this fact. Including one release just last month by the Association of the American Medical Colleges it says, "Demand for physicians continues to grow faster than supply, leading to a projected shortfall of over 90,000 physicians by the year 2025."
4626	Wolk	Lois	94	GIcgVGMKBjg	567	586	Thank you, Madam President. Members, first, I'd just like to make a couple comments about the need for this package, although you all know from your districts what an extraordinary drought we are in. This is the fourth year and it truly is unprecedented. In fact in my opinion, I don't think the drought
4627	Pavley	Fran	104	Z8uHij6BmFM	1	14	And before you start, Bohlen I just wanted to acknowledge the presence of two senators I didn't mention before, Senator Fuller and Senator Ben Allen. Thank you. Please Proceed.
4628	Beall	Jim	92	gB0SqdP0x6o	1348	1364	You're going to stay within that budget, okay. The program when I when I looked at it, you said in your memo that you were going to have all visitors covered by this program. for these institutions. Is that true?
4629	Beall	Jim	92	gDPCmEU7pmg	1088	1106	Okay and kind of the reason is like a redevelopment for poor cities and poor areas, kind of what it is, essentially. So redevelopment for poor cities and poor areas and that probably is more what the original hand of redevelopment when it was first established.
4630	Nguyen	Janet	65	8sqAOKYjfF4	1074	1103	Just out of curiosity, when you would go through the process of putting this bill together. Where did you come up with the 60 minutes and 30 miles, because in Orange County, 60 minutes could be down the street because of traffic. I probably can walk faster than that. That's my question, is in urban areas, like Orange Country, Los Angeles, it might not be 60 minutes. It could be 30 minutes, but 30 minutes still critical.
4631	Pan	Richard	96	6KgzpeS3bCM	1889	1907	Meanwhile, while waiting for a new rate to be finalized, clinics have to continue seeing patients that are only being reimbursed for about 80% of what they're owed. The 80% reimbursement combined with the tight operating margin force many clinics to take out loans so they can continue providing services to the patients they need.
4632	Wolk	Lois	94	SvIBnS8_PpY	6	26	At this point for Ms. Bosler and for Mr. Taylor we have proposal by the Governor to move money fairly quickly for Proposition One and One E which was Two Thousand and Six and then drought expenditures.
4633	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	2QITrr6350o	72	81	I know we've got gender neutral names more and more these days, but I don't see someone who looks like a Larry up there, so Larry, if you'd like to join us. Okay.
4634	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	QnBcTK-as8k	471	495	The law provides that breach notifications must be written in plain language, but is otherwise silent about how the information should be presented or organized. Unfortunately, data breach notices are often written in a way that obscures the information they contain, making them ineffective in communicating critical information to affected California residents.
4635	Leno	Mark	60	Q9LdqK3BIlI	91	120	One moment, please. Actually, the only way to do that would be to actually amend the section out, section 1 out of the bill and take two different votes. I'm going to recommend against that. Anyone can make any motion. I would not deny anyone a motion. But if there were such one I would recommend defeating that motion.

This rule requires that the CSR to complete eight hours of continuing education every two years. However this requirement does not specifically require,

These appointees were heard in the Rules Committee on March 4th and they were voted on a bipartisan manner, 5 to 0. Mr. Jos Gonzlez is the Superintendent of Granada Elementary School and has over 18 years of experience of serving as a school administrator here in the great State of California.
4638	Dodd	Bill	71	XBK8TgfRp6Y	1049	1074	perhaps an outreach with brochures or something like that for the employee that kind of reminds, excuse me, first employers that reminds them the laws and the rules of the land, just so, yeah, yeah, but something that's like frequently asked questions, this is the law of the land.
4639	Nielsen	Jim	68	2NCifixWHPI	1078	1109	That's powerful testimony, Anna Marie, and thank you. And you certainly are attesting to the Ted Puntillo that I know. And I know he's representative of all of you, but he's a cut above with that kind of empathy. And I'm kind of amazed, you anticipated my question, or one of them, what was it like in 1977, compared to now?
4640	Williams	Das	12	Y0xkoNoudD0	834	849	She was the first woman of color to serve in Congress, and she authored landmark gender equality legislation including the title nine amendment to the higher education act which prohibited gender discrimination by federally funded institutions.
4641	Cannella	Anthony	61	pjSDFWGC8xY	1358	1383	When you look at total state funding for transportation, the state spends about $10 billion per year out of a quarter of $1 trillion budget, total budget. So we're talking really a very minor amount of money, when you look at the total state budget, when we have such a need. So again we're talking about raising four, five, $6 billion more a year for transportation over some period of time.
4642	De Leon	Kevin	102	Q1vYBQdDLNc	1680	1700	Thank you. Thank you very much. You know, Mr. Gaines, through the Presidents Lara, I just want to share Cassie Doyle, the spirit of both of the State of California in Canada coming together not just economically, but people-wise too.
4643	Irwin	Jacqui	16	IZt1azLwLX4	692	710	making sure that you had all the information, but sort of succinctly, why did you wait so long, and how would things be done differently and then, the three part question, do you count on accreditation, does that have to be part of your, of the equation also?
4644	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	dKyb6eNIcTg	1214	1225	I have a number of witnesses here who may have dwindled down because they actually do have to go and work second and third jobs because we don't have the abundant employment opportunities that we hope to see.
4645	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	YaizxSy4_NU	1299	1320	That will be so noted. Anything else under motions and resolutions? Under motions and resolutions without objection AB 3 and AB 1352 will be withdrawn from the Committee on rules and order to third reading, without objection.
4646	Melendez	Melissa	41	GObd4JWklwI	2156	2176	Dr. Webber and I had a nice discussion, prior to us all convening, about perhaps some ways we can look at this a little more closely next year. I know this is a disappointment to this community, but I appreciate the effort that went into it, but awfully disappointed it's not that 10%, but thank you for the hard work.
4647	Grove	Shannon	77	G-cKeAHj51U	1408	1419	Regardless of who it is, I would hate for somebody to request their vote to be made for a particular person or party or whatever and then that be circumvented by the caregiver.
4648	Obernolte	Jay	86	DaiegGG5yrM	91	110	If you compare, according to the US Energy Information Administration, if you compare our average energy prices against the rest of the country, we're 41% higher than the national average in residential rates, 36% higher in commercial rates, and 62% higher than the national average in industrial rates which really affect the competitiveness of our state.
4649	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	D-fVk6CkUDE	627	639	So, I've said time and time again, my breasts are as worthwhile as your prostate, and I think they should be reflected in California law. So, I respectfully hope you'll consider the analysis of this.
4650	Eggman	Susan Talamantes	73	LXP_ciN3hzY	1177	1200	And, I was always struck when I went into Japanese homes and Japanese communities were big users of hospice having a huge value on family and home and community, and when I would go into a home there's people would introduce me around, they would always stop and show me the picture of the family in the camp as though it was just a part of their history they had integrated into their lives to say here's a part of our history, but we've overcome it.
4651	De Leon	Kevin	102	E7bFLC4httQ	563	584	Let's talk a little about the dirt, if you will, of color, what is without doubt the most prestigious public University system in the entire world and what it pertains for us as a state given that we're the eighth largest economy in the world.
4652	Hernandez	Roger	37	1E-hERPJ9VM	509	523	as a recipient of Prop 63 and 41 funds to move a project, that those kinds of projects that have merged dollars with a five-year commitment, that they would be treated with a priority. Because if they put it together, they have service dollars there.
4653	Hueso	Ben	48	r49jrzf4Gi8	1017	1041	And I have to just chime in. You'll probably see more projects like this one come forward in the future as you see our energy charts display surplus amounts of energy. When that surplus creates itself, there's gonna be a drop in the price of that energy. In many cases, there'll be no place to put it.
4654	De Leon	Kevin	102	gvvbkQTOc28	1150	1178	So let's go to file item number three, colleagues, we have a few more government appointees however they are not required to appear. We got file item number three, I through M. I through M. Can I get a motion? We have a motion made by Miss Mitchell. Madam Secretary, please call the roll.
4655	Wieckowski	Bob	55	670ewxdSqNM	377	388	And and I'm sure not a website is the only communication. You want personal contact and, and some, the ability to make sure that they're aware of the opportunities that are available to them.
4656	Wolk	Lois	94	PyDS77ZdGH4	1855	1867	Mr. Chair, I want to thank you for conducting an excellent hearing and our staff of putting together excellent panelists,  just highlighting all the issues. I really appreciate that.
4657	Nguyen	Janet	65	BifOW5Vhe4Q	431	449	Prior to realignment, county jails have a combined capacity of 76,000 beds and 17 counties face court orders to limit their jail population. More than 150,000 felon offenders have since been shifted to local government for our responsibility.
4658	Patterson	Jim	119	QFffajW9pIQ	1301	1338	The board hires the ALJ. So, I appreciate your explanation. I want to take the next step to the difference in California, with respect to the National Labor Relations Act, that does not require the posting of a bond in order for an employer to appeal an ALRB decision, at least that is my understanding. Why should California deviate from that?
4659	Dahle	Brian	47	Om99VHbxcmc	1314	1335	Thank you Mr. Chairman and thank you for coming, Mr. Picker. I appreciate that. I want to make just make a comment mainly on the RPS. You know, all renewables aren't equal. I say that because I have the first assembly district, which is from Nevada County clear to the Oregon border. I represent an area that burns up every year and I have bio mass plants out there that are renewable.
4660	Gatto	Mike	46	LiSz4J23j1Q	995	1005	But if it is the will the committee to park this and take a deep breath, and think about it, then I will ask the gentleman from Los Angeles to withdraw his motion and we can park it and continue to work on it.
4661	McGuire	Mike	93	GHyOxyKfubI	1053	1072	In addition, the violence with this industry must be stopped. Because the state has looked the other way for so long, a significant criminal element has taken hold. And while the majority of growers and those involved in the industry are law abiding Californians, organized crime has taken hold.
4662	McGuire	Mike	93	GHyOxyKfubI	1038	1053	Northern and central California watersheds have been inundated with sediment and poisons, such as fertilizers and pesticides. In fact, cannabis growths are the number one source of sediment and nutrient loads in Northern California rivers and streams.
4663	Bloom	Richard	2	79bMZ-eNloc	382	397	Let me start off with one question and that is how does the enforcement authority that you're proposing in this trailer bill differ from that that the state board already has?
4664	Chang	Ling Ling	18	qrJj2d7lUww	166	178	AB 19 will serve as the catalyst for change. A change in the regulations that stifle businesses and job growth. And change in the way we treat small business as the backbone of California's economy.
4665	Hill	Jerry	66	mZDplXo566U	548	568	The gas safety branch audit found a number of other problems, including a lack of consistency, focus, organization, depth and rigor, adequate recordkeeping and clear expectations and utility efficient practices and a lack of performance measures, clear expectations. And the, and there's no, currently no budget for education that we've seen.
4666	Gipson	Mike	28	Gf9OHu0urRM	1283	1296	Thank you very much. I have a question. Why does it take so long? Why does it takes six years to deal with the re-benching initiatives? That seems to be a long, exorbitant time to complete, so.
4667	Pavley	Fran	104	-yLqvo8WX6M	787	810	Thank you.   Anyone else opposing this measure? Seeing and hearing none. I'll open it up for discussion by members of the committee before Senator Nielsen gives his close. Any other questions of Senator Nielsen or comments? Would you like him to close? Any questions of the
4668	Chang	Ling Ling	18	qrJj2d7lUww	150	166	Their significance, however, could be even greater if were not for California's environment of overregulation, as we consistently rank among the worst state in regulatory environment and business friendliness rankings, which explain our high rate of unemployment and poverty rate.
4669	Chiu	David	7	sA6uJxeRGKk	535	543	Seeing and hearing no other debate, we can take a voice call all these amendments. All those in favor of the amendments say aye, all opposed please say no, the ayes have it. The amendments are adopted. The bill is out to print and back on file.
4670	Wood	Jim	72	RtQ8dRQaXv0	443	467	Thank you Mr. Chair and members. Before you now is AB, excuse me, Assembly Bill 243. In 1996 voters approved Proposition 215, also knows as the Compassionate Use Act, as such a person can grow medical marijuana for medical use under prescription referred to as a 215 card. And over time a system has evolved where patients can purchase medical marijuana dispensiariess.
4671	Gatto	Mike	46	6dKd_uGq3Mo	1116	1127	Secondly I, I just want to thank all of the the guys and gals who came up from Los Angeles from our area, to testify in favor of this bill. Your presence is duly noted.
4672	Fuller	Jean	49	52URYfZsNNs	724	739	According to section 51 242 of the education code, local school boards may currently elect to except a pupil from a PE course if that pupil is engaged in a school sponsored in an interscholastic athletic program.
4673	Roth	Richard	106	6ZFJhjHlIb4	1542	1557	One final question, Mr. Chair, if I may. For the USDVA representative, what's the average length of time, if you can say, at least in the Palo Alto system. That it takes a veteran to secure a mental health appointment?
4674	Leno	Mark	60	fNOTPzEYh_E	153	167	With regard to the 30% we're talking, do we know what the total universe of this pool of investment money is? I think it's maybe in the neighborhood of $3 billion? - $3.2 billion, I'm told. -
4675	Patterson	Jim	119	TSE2ocY_LpM	875	897	the loss is the result of them ending their current policy of overcharging new licensees for a short term license, as well as minor costs from adjusting their computer systems to make this change. This bill has received strong bipartisan support, it passed every Committee unanimously throughout the legislative process.
4676	Chiu	David	7	8MjX_09Duus	1246	1260	Our city has, I think a very good record of working with wireless providers on these issues and and I share the concerns that this would make the bill much harder. That being said again, I'm happy to continue discussions to see if we can address this as the bill moves through the process.
4677	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	4INVuEQu1gA	1773	1795	We are now, according to Child Care Aware, the 13th least affordable state in the nation for infant and toddler care, and 17th least affordable in preschool. And with the average cost of about $12,000 it is about the same amount of money that it costs system wide for student fees and tuition for the University of California.
4678	Hernandez	Ed	103	o6dY6yB1_H8	2708	2720	That current vote count is 5-2. That bill is out. Item number fourteen, SB 610 Pan. Do pass as amended to appropriations. Current vote count is 7-0. Call the absent members.
4679	Gipson	Mike	28	SQe4IQVjZKc	339	353	I'm disappointed in that response because I think that this department can certainly mandate one getting accurate data as it relates to response time because children are waiting for services.
4680	McGuire	Mike	93	qbDN-8u61LI	51	65	I wanna start out this afternoon and get into this evening by thanking the Chair, the Committee, and the hard-working staff for such an excellent and thorough staff analysis.
4681	Quirk	Bill	23	1fxZCVj9XoA	1620	1640	The witness from the Orange County DA here is a scholar in this area. He has brought me many cases which on commonsense grounds, at least my common sense and I think the common sense of these members, are clearly crimes yet they weren't... didn't go forward.
4682	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	dAgT763r35w	753	773	Well, I think, again, this is such an unclear area of law that perhaps I'm assuming something I shouldn't. I think part of this is that we want to get some predictability and reliability on what we can and cannot require of this fairly new technology.
4683	Stone	Jeff	26	Q9LdqK3BIlI	1243	1264	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'll be brief. With regard to the amnesty program, I certainly understand what we're trying to do here. We have people that didn't pay for their traffic tickets. They had escalations and fines. And they went to go renew their driver's license, didn't have the money, couldn't get a driver's license, became unemployed.
4684	Beall	Jim	92	1tbz59-ST4g	942	977	Well, just entering the discussion, I wanna make it clear there's currently, I don't believe any special session bill that uses the vehicle license fee. Is that correct?  So I just wanna make it clear And I think Senator Huff introduced his constitutional amendment based on me introducing SB 16 during the regular session.
4685	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	vEySB-JPx9Q	1559	1571	And so, we have to ask ourselves, what kind of care and early education do we have for the 0 to 3 age and the answer is way short of what we need.
4686	Pan	Richard	96	t4_AyYAahhk	781	792	Sometimes you try to get your questions in during class, but sometimes it's like "I don't really quite understand it," or "I go home and I read it and I still "don't get it and I need to be able to..." and When that isn't available, or the career counseling, potentially a faculty member can give in terms of mentorship.
4687	Huff	Bob	105	4RPfdYzqQQc	198	214	LA county's largest the state with 2.4 million children and youth between the ages of 0 and 20 years. Currently, the Department of Child and Family Services, DCFS, employs 7500 workers, 32 of which are children's social workers.
4688	Quirk	Bill	23	rW1B4Jx9iIw	631	648	Thank you, Assembly Member Lackey. Really appreciate your bringing that perspective here. And certainly, it's just a very important perspective to have. I'm very glad you're a member of this committee. All right.
4689	Hertzberg	Robert	99	cvDmVx__4xs	2101	2115	General Motors files for property tax in the county if they own property in your county, but they certainly don't file for things that they have in other jurisdictions or things that move around. And it seems to me that that's a pretty, making that statement doesn't really address the issue.
4690	Weber	Shirley	44	7vSg9-FP5Qk	245	263	I even like to have elected officials, who don't want to be elected officials. Because very honestly, they do very different. I didn't want to come here, I was recruited, like crazy. I didn't want to come here, but there's some people who's been planning to come here their whole life. Okay. And seriously, and that can be a problem. That can be a problem, we know that.
4691	Cooper	Jim	21	CGzgwiFisVc	154	172	And right now, most of your locations are brick and mortar locations you're dealing with. And obviously with this, it's going to open up to a whole new realm, not just the, for the locations, but to me, it's gonna be a tough road to haul, dealing with some of the issues that the internet brings.
4692	Stone	Jeff	26	9_Ipr5dyo2o	757	796	their general fund, which they will only be able to recoup if they're successful. So, to summarize, I have five cities that are big losers in the approximately 12-13 cities that I represent. The County, of course, of Riverside is on the hook for $24 million if this does not pass or if my colleague from Riverside's bill get signed into law, but unfortunately it's suffered vetoes in the past. So, there's
4693	Leno	Mark	60	LPogPkqnefY	1668	1678	Are we sitting on money for food assistance? It doesn't seem like that's as complicated as some of the other areas that we've talked about, and we know the need is only growing, so where are we with that?
4694	Leno	Mark	60	c8SqTr4brJk	1443	1464	So, as Senator Wynn clearly articulated, what that mandate does, again, I think we have some comfort level, significant in recognizing this has been suspended. The mandate reimbursement issue's not withstanding.
4695	Lara	Ricardo	107	1VsIgdliTQw	231	246	Amendments taken in Assembly remove the request for a waiver and add implementation language for the children's program. Ensuring that every kid in California grows up healthy, with an opportunity to thrive and succeed is the right thing to do.
4696	Hancock	Loni	98	uM-vqP4Hv8s	1673	1688	And I'm sorry, we can't really-- we don't want our great public institutions to lead the race to the bottom. I do think both for the committee it does underscore our responsibility to adequately--
4697	Wieckowski	Bob	55	zM_5KJn1lso	20	32	So let's fast forward. Where are some of the other opportunities that we should be looking at as Legislature for the leverage? And we brought up fires. I guess the Sierra...
4698	Hertzberg	Robert	99	898OiW72jWg	356	369	Was there analysis of budget overruns with respect to private sectors and change-orders and the like? So, cuz at the end of the day you're trying to build something, right? And the question is who's gonna do it? What were those change orders?
4699	Cooley	Ken	45	WiCoRtyssyw	294	316	Very good. Good Afternoon Mr. Chair, and members. I'm here to present AB 924. This bill will reinstate the State Children's Trust Fund. As a donation option as people pay their income taxes to support child abuse prevention programs in California. I definitely want to thank the committee staff in working on this bill and look for
4700	Cooley	Ken	45	mNyHP9HDpqk	480	508	Yes. I want to thank the committee for their outstanding collaboration, in working through this issue. And, I am a McGeorge alum, this grows out of their, that educational process. I was happy to say I will champion this measure but it is not a field in which I have particular expertise and, Mr. Chair you have some counsel?
4701	Hancock	Loni	98	PR6Aqie0NK4	384	415	You know, let me just say, having worked on this and being part of the two initiatives that we did on this, it might be interesting for the committee at some point to hear from people from Arizona who were candidates. You see, you're saying if you, Ben Allen, in a big money system start knocking on doors asking for $5 or $10, it cheapens your pitch, if you will. If you have a system where it's clear---.
4702	Leno	Mark	60	iVjsAvWHgB0	1356	1370	Because we want to make sure every individual is cared for appropriately as we make the transition from developmental center to the community. But the state will experience some significant savings.
4703	De Leon	Kevin	102	oE98JCD72Xk	345	378	Through the Chair, and Mr. Harper, I thank you very much for your comments, as well as your perspective. Mr. Chair, if you don't mind, I'd just like to, on page seven of the bill, just wanna note for the record that we have on page, I'm sorry, on page seven, line 18, it may go, not quite directly, but perhaps indirectly to one of Mr. Harper's concerns, which, Mr. Harper's duly noted too.
4704	Brown	Cheryl	13	4IkAjWExsPI	980	992	This is a first for aging and long term care AB 1518 will help wean our state off the default and most expensive settings of setting of long term care.
4705	Roth	Richard	106	TbimRTTdSU4	283	302	And just if I may, Mr. Chair. The fact that only six businesses utilize this provision, I don't know over what period of time, but it doesn't matter, six is hardly going to be devastating to the overall program, in the state of California, at least, on a statewide basis.
4706	Williams	Das	12	1l8Sm-QNSvU	715	735	If the senator would like to author something like that I would be happy to co-author and be your, be your floor manager on the assembly side. I think that would reduce the instance of needing to come back to the legislature. Just has not been done very often with a CPI.
4707	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	aagt3kLsyTc	504	524	And I appreciate it, and I wanted to thank you for your hard work on it. I know that I've had a similar, parallel track, both last year and now bill awaiting a vote in the Assembly. But it is, I think, time that we recognize, particularly with low-income people, that this notion of taking time off from work really is a last resort.
4708	Gatto	Mike	46	M5Sfl5zR2ew	1107	1119	That's better because most parents right now, the two or three, last year, who wrote the state agency because it's all tied together, they ended up opting out of the screening, the initial screening too, beyond just the research and experimentation.
4709	Campos	Nora	76	QFffajW9pIQ	200	213	You should have received a copy of the mock-up of the amendments. The bill I am presenting is AB-561, a bill that would help expedite the process for farm workers to recover the fair wages they are rightfully owed.
4710	Dababneh	Matthew	50	6FS_MTpGrZk	867	894	many cases desperate. Not every situation, but you've highlighted that in a very, I think, eloquent way, what things should we be doing within this industry? Not in a broad perspective financial literacy, but the point of the loan at the point of the transaction what more can we doing to encourage financial literacy, to being, giving more transparency to be making consumers more aware of the situation they find themselves and what the consequences that will be from this perspective?
4711	Stone	Mark	20	RFWwgE7ubok	1856	1869	Thank you. Anyone else in opposition? Seeing none. And Senator Hueso I understand that you're taking some of the amendments that are here. But I know that there are other amendments that you'll be taking as the bill moves towards appropriations.
4712	Lara	Ricardo	107	uprCp-AfCts	1548	1565	We wanna give them an opportunity to be able to better themselves and also be safe. And by saying that now they need some sort of permit that we're gonna relegate them to some of the most dangerous parts of our cities throughout the state, makes complete no sense.
4713	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	6y6CtxPlgMo	1889	1905	And has really grown to be an athletic competition. And so because of that kind of unique positioning of cheerleading, it's been a fight at the local level to get cheerleading identified as a sport for decades. Since I was a cheerleader, and I watched my daughter go through the same thing.
4714	Bates	Pat	58	vppxPTwkbs8	345	364	And we made promises and those were kept and had no problem on the second round to get M2 pass, that's what we call it. And in Southern Orange County, it passed with almost 75% of voters voting in favor. So, it's just what has to be foundational to anything we do.
4715	Gomez	Jimmy	80	rOcxPrNyERc	325	342	SB 46 extends the definition of family members to allow workers to care for seriously ill adult children siblings grandparents, grandchildren, and parent-in-laws. California has the second highest percentage of multi-generational households in the country.
4716	Wolk	Lois	94	jSkO5GUtg1k	1344	1361	So, along that line, do you foresee any changes based on your current work to your statutory authority, any that need to happen in order to allow you to protected the groundwater?
4717	Hancock	Loni	98	WPX0fE7wHjw	1320	1347	I would simply note, because I've been doing some reading on this,that long sentence is does not appear to have significant deterrents. We've heard of two cases here. One, a horrendous case that I would guess because of the stringent see the parole board's would be unlikely to be recommended for parole.
4718	Dodd	Bill	71	9Z8rBNEmUBE	174	198	I was met in the stairwell by the Cal OES. And I really, really thank Cal OES for the fabulous job. We hear often about how we don't react favorably as governments during these natural disasters, but this why I'm more, certainly, we're very appreciative to Cal OES and what they've done.
4719	Chavez	Rocky	83	Zu2V1blghnQ	496	512	We were in Okinawa, and he'd taken the time to sit back to talk to all officers about what it was like to be in the corps, what his experience was. He was one of the first fighter pilots to raise that rank in the marine corps.
4720	Hancock	Loni	98	WPX0fE7wHjw	1348	1374	The other, a young man, who at age twenty three, and I met a number of inmates like this in our prisons, can be riding in a car with someone who robbed a store with a gun, they end up twenty five to life and now they're 55 and, medically, in very bad shape. And, they would be eligible for consideration.
4721	Mullin	Kevin	31	G-cKeAHj51U	283	306	But I supported that, in light of the fact that it didn't touch the November elections. In my home county, San Mateo County, a number of jurisdictions are having elections this November. They hold elections in odd number years. I think November is a generally recognized time when elections occur.
4722	Roth	Richard	106	UmXyuczgH_s	1869	1878	And I for one, ask questions on that subject. I know many of my colleagues ask similar questions on this side and the other side of the building on that subject.
4723	Leno	Mark	60	bq30nlpq090	847	872	We're nowhere near where we might have been if it hadn't been for global catastrophe. So, we have endless needs and on the expenditure side we never conclude our debates as to what our top priorities are, how we manage all the infrastructural needs, or even mention the unfunded liabilities. the wall of debt.
4724	Pavley	Fran	104	-_4-MnSxShM	1176	1189	Yep, I see no problems with it. Okay, any other people here wishing to lend on their name in support? I know you were here for answering primarily questions if there were any, but if you wanted to add your name or a brief comment.
4725	Beall	Jim	92	84LBK3fic7E	678	693	SB 16 will save the state money in the future and alleviate the need to raise even higher revenue in future years. We can pay now, or we can pay a lot later. We have a long way to go, but I think everyone can agree on the needs.
4726	Wolk	Lois	94	U5tNwb5MlsY	231	255	Many people were involved in that effort and  we are seeking a balance it seems to me between the certain imperative to move the money out quickly, and at the same time to exercise legislative oversight in making certain that the projects that are funded and the money is used well and achieves the greatest benefit state wide.
4727	Pan	Richard	96	bxDlgoZu0KI	878	893	District advisory committees benefits the school closure process because they help the school district conduct the comprehensive impact study that includes projected cost savings and fiscal analysis. This helps school districts make their final decision and can limit the negative fiscal effects caused by school closure.
4728	Galgiani	Cathleen	95	B4ydjBRtO3M	1330	1351	And we called CHP and they were able to lend some of their officers to assist with doing some of the reports that were required on the murders and so forth that relieved some of the officers within the department to be able to triage all the crises that were coming at them at the time.
4729	Thurmond	Tony	4	8w2MCxTnakA	1271	1280	Again, we look forward to working to support as many efforts as we can to help our young people get great mental health services, and thank you, and I urge your aye vote.
4730	Garcia	Cristina	112	UmXyuczgH_s	1003	1014	It would create the California Childhood Immunization Quality Improvement Fund which would be funded by voluntary contributions from Medi-Cal managed care organizations, and matched by an equal amount of federal funds.

In 1969, Bill became the general manager of
4732	Leno	Mark	60	k_l5daYZc00	1649	1670	If it does not pass we will then come back to the original motion by Senator Block. And that then we move on to the next item. So again, Senator Nielson's motion is to accept the Governor's proposal, and Senator Block's is to take the staff recommendation. And we will call the roll on Senator Nielson's motion for the Governor's proposal.
4733	De Leon	Kevin	102	ze-YP1FOzwQ	226	251	So I'll be at 65,000 new jobs. We talk about the economically-depressed areas, which are absolutely accurate. Central Valley, Imperial Valley, but to date I have not seen the fossil fuel industry or any other industry put forth any reasonable economic growth policy for the working men and women of these areas.
4734	Beall	Jim	92	GcYm7_0fTAo	1765	1815	All right, good. Other speakers in favor. How about opposition? Any opposition to this bill? Anybody? I just wanna comment about something on this bill. I think some of us that were in the legislature for a few years remember the days when we had to close state parks. It was an awful, awful thing. We asked the private sector to come through. We had the funding from the private sector groups that keep our, some of our parks open. It was horrible. When we did that, we were looking for creative ways of funding the parks just to keep the state parks open.
4735	Pavley	Fran	104	BNQtV-nHj20	2	25	Oh, you're supporting it? Then that. Then, Senator Hall if you would like to present. Do we have a quorum first? We don't.  We need one more member, so we'll start as a Subcommittee and Senator Hall, would you please present Senate Bill 399.
4736	Liu	Carol	63	2ZjsVXuo_n0	290	302	And I want to clarify that it's my intent to focus the bill on the complex policy around restructuring the K-12 School Facilities Program and how we fund schools' facilities.
4737	Roth	Richard	106	IKESHE_NOXc	1256	1275	And, at the same time he kept the community calm. The result was the first ever state Attorney General mandated reform through a consent decree in the history. And, it brought about dramatic improvements in the Riverside police departments
4738	Ting	Philip	30	TW1YYeO9oEI	1805	1818	I understand but I don't see that. Soonest is not something on the calendar, so I'm kind of trying to understand from a calendar and you talked about coming back next year. I'm trying to understand, are you talking next fiscal year, next calendar year?
4739	Pavley	Fran	104	ymi21hh5WVg	2231	2261	Not that we don't welcome your attendance at our committee hearings, but let's allow just a minute for the room to clear of anyone that not staying to listen to your conservancy bill. I was going to share with the members that my family was in Africa, one of their elephant stories, a pride of lions was attacking a water buffalo and just clawing it to death.
4740	Chu	Kansen	32	43PD-O5b090	1471	1487	Well, thank you very much. First of all, I wanna thank the senator for working on some last minute amendment over the weekend and also your willingness to continue working with the opposition to refine this bill.
4741	Nguyen	Janet	65	bxDlgoZu0KI	1425	1439	And it is time to update these numbers to find out what effect these fees have on current housing prices. The median value of a home in California is 150% higher than the national median value. Local development fees are part of this cost.
4742	Hancock	Loni	98	12bt77nSPXs	410	440	and how we deal with people front end so they don't decompensate and become more stressed when they're incarcerated. And how we add options so that, since most people will be returning to the community, they will be able to return and make a successful re-entry. So we will be looking at that and
4743	Leyva	Connie	62	oDMixRIfl_Y	388	397	Well, thank you very much for your attention to that, and we don't ever want to inhibit new and creative business, but we do want to make sure it's properly regulated for everyone.
4744	Stone	Mark	20	leAiZf7wn9s	1111	1127	And I guess if it were really only used internally, but it seems like once somebody is on that list, there are other implications with other agencies who can ask one of the sheriffs, if somebody's on the gang list, they then get characterized as a gang member for other purposes.
4745	Hancock	Loni	98	t4hQNDqgAZU	516	537	I would like that information too, Senator,  because that was the nuts of my question, if my child is immunized, and they go a school where most people are, but there are some children who aren't, and one of those children gets the disease, what are the chances of my child getting it, because...
4746	Williams	Das	12	Jz7jqD0KYyk	288	310	also while relieving employers of unanticipated statutory penalties. The bill was developed by labor unions, employers, and the administration to do two things. Going forward the bill provides for workers to be paid properly for the rest periods and all their times at work, including time when they are not doing piece-rate work.
4747	Quirk	Bill	23	seV-S-c1PNk	87	113	Concerned about the safety of our roads, I, along with my colleague, my joint author Assembly Member Lackey, are proud to author AB 51 which essentially codifies CHPs lane splitting guidelines.  I would like to state that my office has been working very closely with many members of the motorcycle community to address their concerns.
4748	Moorlach	John	4657	HJEL7SBoV-4	1775	1788	Because I, you made the case, I just didn't see that in the material. So that would just be a request, Madame Chair, if we could, at least for those of us who are not attorneys just to get some examples of what we're fixing.
4749	Dodd	Bill	71	Eeoi3ciuPzc	338	354	Thank you Mr. Chair and members. Recognizing that I'm standing between you and lunch, I will certainly go through this very very, important bill on the highlights. Today I presenting AB 1354, the Equal Pay For Equal Work Act.
4750	Stone	Jeff	26	yp3pHtPtFfM	1087	1103	Especially the growing autism problem and empowering and helping the Regional Centers, which is something is very important to me, and very dear to my family and friends and look forward to working with you on that.
4751	Beall	Jim	92	898OiW72jWg	595	615	Senator, your bill is a 5% annual reduction and it's assuming that there's gonna be an attrition rate of 5%, and I want to ask is the Caltrans attrition rate 5%, or what's the projected attrition rate?
4752	Rendon	Anthony	120	hrVBNy8V670	284	295	I respect what the LA County Superior Court has done to promote justice within its limited reasons-- within its limited resources as well as those in San Francisco and other places throughout the state.
4753	Pan	Richard	96	Zk_K_zhn8-Q	1860	1882	So you know, certainly one of the other concerns is with the elimination of, federally-funded the Medicare, the Medical fee bump, which basically bought primary care to Medicare. That ended at the end of last year's that's an 86% cut in payments to primary care physicians in the state for Medical.
4754	Monning	Bill	25	71FNaoH1Uwg	1104	1127	That said, I share many of the concerns raised today of how words do matter in the way formulate resolutions that may seem well intentioned or innocuous can be misinterpreted or used for other purposes and we've heard some, I think, important examples that are not theoretical. That's what's playing out unfortunately in higher education.
4755	Hueso	Ben	48	zgKkKMVKglc	93	114	Currently, they're using the public right-of-way for this task and using temporary facilities. This project has been in the envisioning process, and it's as you know, development projects often require lots of preparation.
4756	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	i194v81Ek5E	314	326	The second is the Westside Subway Extension which is called the Purple Line. It runs from Downtown to Brentwood. Well, it will run from Downtown and Brentwood under Wilshire Boulevard.
4757	Mathis	Devon	75	QoWDHxezaEY	141	161	The bill has no formal opposition and has the support of local law enforcement agents such as Tulare County Sheriff's Department, The Tulare County District Attorney's Office, and passed through the Assembly Appropriations, and the Assembly floor on consent. At this time I welcome the Committee's comments and questions.
4758	Bonta	Rob	85	tf_1MHXwKaY	238	255	Nothing less, it's a floor. It's a beginning point. It's a starting point. It's insurance. And then, through the IDRP process, they can receive more, if the facts of their situation dictate that. Up to an unlimited amount. There's no ceiling. There's no cap.
4759	Hernandez	Ed	103	LYOrqHadQ70	186	196	I made some suggestions, I made several suggestions to reach out to both the authors. Everything from changing, oh, we just recently talked about potential changing the medical exemptions.
4760	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	ZurQFkaNhto	685	695	As I am a health advocate, I like to implement healthy eating, active living on my school campus and community, therefore I support assembly bill 292 Time to Eat.
4761	Hernandez	Roger	37	gAr6GrRaKTs	781	806	Mr. Chair and Members, thank you for listening to all the important opinions brought forth today. A challenge has arisen in our California schools. While there is general understanding that public education dollars directed to school districts cannot be used to make a profit, CAVA's primary vendor and manager is K-12 Inc., a for-profit corporation based out of state, a clear violation of California's ethics regarding public schools.
4762	Bloom	Richard	2	-bJq_JGSuxY	1368	1395	If we are truly serious about doubling the energy efficiency in our existing buildings, and we should be, it must also be done with real investments in building upgrades and utilizing technological advances, not simply changes to how we calculate our savings. I have with me today Steve Schiller with the California Energy Efficiency Industry Council who wishes to speak in support and answer any questions that the committee may have, thank you.
4763	Wolk	Lois	94	_JbASqkciSI	2262	2275	This has been made worse by the drought and certainly was an impetus for much of the money that is put into Prop 1 by the legislature and the governor.
4764	Ting	Philip	30	l3Ffe0dfTvk	2216	2238	We've been, you know, this is my third year on the committee, you know. I do believe that the budget becomes a little bit less mysterious every year to me. But having said that, you know, this type of action doesn't give me any confidence that we should be giving UC additional resources.
4765	Runner	Sharon	4656	1dDkNt95rgU	1481	1501	Thank you. Thank you very much. We have a foster child in my family who was in eight foster homes in five years, before my adult son and his wife adopted him at 11.
4766	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	vHDzhT6IdSE	2017	2040	All right. Six to zero, the consent calendar passes. File item five by Senator Wieckowski was pulled. File item six, SB 316, by Senator Mitchell is on call. The vote count is five to zero. Motion due passed to senate appropriations. Please call the absent members.
4767	Beall	Jim	92	LW2wm2tITKQ	265	300	When I was graduating from San Jose State I got my first job as a beginning level planner for the town of Los Gatos and I used to deliver my council member here from Los Gatos the package of all the planning reports. This is quite some time ago but he's been serving our community ever since and he's done a fine job on the open space district. But I'd like to congratulate Rich Gordon as well so I would move this bill.
4768	Obernolte	Jay	86	bKCoiLHe7ac	1301	1314	And on this trailer bill, we're saying, we don't trust you to do the right thing because we think that there are instances where you should be consolidating where you're not. So, I'll opt to think about that a little bit more, but that's my concern.
4769	Chavez	Rocky	83	eYTxGLtgMco	1077	1094	You know, what's the, what's the greatest threat to you? What maybe totally appropriate as a 10% reserve probably isn't appropriate when you need maybe actually maybe 50% of your operational budget for the year, depending on the threat to the organization, that's why you have a reserve.
4770	Pavley	Fran	104	knpBhgRlo8Q	732	745	I know in my neck of the woods, Topanga state park and some others, Los Encinos Historic Park, wouldn't have survived through this time without their amazing voluntary spirit and their love for state parks.
4771	Thurmond	Tony	4	IbDqH1ykNPs	5	17	We definitely intend to continue the conversation about the COLA.. You know, having come from the non-profit world where you're often told do more with less, I am certainly sensitive to the concerns about that.
4772	Mitchell	Holly	64	gCh9-ng4HsU	28	51	Anyway, so thank you very much for the opportunity to present to you a bill that is very very important to me and the people who've come here to provide expert testimony today. And that's SB 23, a measure that seeks to remove the discriminatory and ineffective family cap in place for families receiving CalWORKs benefits.
4773	Cannella	Anthony	61	1JV-wI6cFUY	722	741	So it could be. Thank you very much, and then lastly just a clarification of public space: the bill defines a public space as property owned in whole or in part by state or local government entity or any property (any property, I guess, would be private properties as well) upon which there is an easement for public use and that is held open to the public.
4774	Gordon	Richard	117	nhED5L0HREU	993	1023	The second major change would add Assembly Rule 29.5 to describe the duties of the Assistant Speaker Pro Tem. Third, we would amend subdivision F of Assembly Rule 32 to clarify the process of the Chief Clerk's office distributing the Committee preference form to members, and finally we would amend Assembly rule 58.5 to clarify that a particular Committee process relating to holding open the roll applies to both Assembly and Senate bills.
4775	Lara	Ricardo	107	LFikd5rYakY	158	178	policy that Slovakia has implemented and other countries are considering pretty much choosing who gets to live and die, members, by the basis of their religion. A very scary thought, members, if we stop and reflect of what that really means. The vast majority of people who have left Syria wish they have never had to and wish
4776	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	FVQ4YG_BqFE	1211	1235	They're then eaten by fish and bottom crawlers, and they're carcinogenic. Then they get fed through the rest of the food chain. So, it's a tool that's never been used and in California we don't want it to be used and I would have to respectfully disagree. I don't believe OSPR has ever taken the position they support them.
4777	Gray	Adam	27	AJJV4Jngl_c	1505	1518	I was elected in 2012. If the voters keep me around, I may be able to stay here 'til 2024. Am I going to see the completion of a surface storage project during my tenure here?
4778	Lara	Ricardo	107	LFikd5rYakY	195	225	World War II, the United States cannot sit back and allow refugees to languish. Members, many of us have seen the horrific pictures of those children off the coast of Europe who lie lifeless on those beaches. Many of us don't want to see those, but that is the reality of what is happening today. We need to play a leadership role in preserving life and dignity and welcome refugees into United States. I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
4779	Hueso	Ben	48	5cbDr55Nnpw	1440	1456	I want to thank Senator Vidak for bringing this important measure forward and this is a message to Washington that this is a very important issue to our state and to our country and they should act immediately, thank you.
4780	Hill	Jerry	66	N5kRSRB-qaQ	7	30	Senate Committee on Business Professions and Economic Development and the hearing for today. We have two bills that have been put over. Item number two, SB 270, by Senator Mendoza, which will be heard on the 20th and item number six, SB 561, by Senator Monee, will be heard on the 27th of April.
4781	De Leon	Kevin	102	8L1SsBHKNBQ	63	77	That is Mr. Gregory, I hope I pronounce this correctly. Ahern, Mark Andre, as well as Michael Miles. Why don't we take Mr. Ahern up first, if, I hope I pronounced it correctly.
4782	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	g595lZYQYE0	1561	1575	A lot of times when people think artificial turf, they think back to the original, you know, football artificial turf that looks like green carpet, which I think is fine, but you know, I live where people park on their driveways, I mean, on their lawns.
4783	De Leon	Kevin	102	8L1SsBHKNBQ	46	63	Okay. 3-0, it passes, however we will leave the role open so other members can add on. Let's go to file item number 2. We have three members that are appointments of the governor that are required to appear.
4784	Mitchell	Holly	64	dmdc2oNqHGQ	477	493	If there is a new element that wasn't shared in either Senators Pan or Hueso's testimony, there's a new element you wanna share, feel free to do so but we're gonna try very hard to avoid repetition. Fair enough? Fair enough? First witness.
4785	Stone	Jeff	26	zr4fqdcgBEU	5	46	First of all, thank you for the opportunity. I had proposed a couple of bills, SB 638 and 639, that were addressing restoration of the cutbacks to the regional centers and developmental centers and the closure of Sonoma and Fairview. And as a part of the bill is now a two year bill. But that bill makes it very clear that any of the proceeds from the scaling back of those facilities or selling off the assets of those facilities will go back to the developmental community.
4786	Beall	Jim	92	pjSDFWGC8xY	181	220	That's important to recognize. If we have to put it in a form of a constitutional amendment, I think that's important. I also agree with you that, and maybe I would even go further than you do- That any future revenue, that's dedicated to road repair and safety projects, ought to be stabilized for the life-cycle cost of repair and stabilizing our road repair deficit that we now have. We need to have a fund that sticks on that, and not be diverted into,
4787	Beall	Jim	92	pjSDFWGC8xY	220	244	not only other non-transportation purposes, but purposes of transportation projects, that various people would wanna achieve. And we've had that discussion, so I think that that's maybe a little narrower viewpoint or philosophy, than even you have on a constitutional amendment.
4788	Gordon	Richard	117	9MQl_MfHN90	675	689	Great. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, I'd like to start by thanking the committee for the thoughtful analysis and the suggested amendments to strengthen the consumer protection aspects of this bill.
4789	Atkins	Toni	110	GOY1w5EVdhE	551	569	Today, more than 40 percent of Californians speak a language other than english at home. As you know, when limited english speaking individuals attempt to access healthcare, the language barrier can contribute to inadequate patient evaluation, lack of appropriate treatment, unnecessary procedures and cost.
4790	Wolk	Lois	94	HI3s5jZHv_Q	924	953	Okay. Thank you very much Dr. Swanson. I'll ask you questions later. I want to go through the panel first. Certainly, one of the things I wanted to ask you afterwards, and probably all of you, is if the tunnels will not meet your particular goal of the restoration of the degradation of the ecosystem, what would?
4791	Liu	Carol	63	_3qtjRH3Z-4	67	82	These are job-ready Californians who with the right skills and placement can support themselves and their families. Unfortunately, the CalFresh E&T Program is fraught with ambiguous regulations that keep applicants from receiving support.
4792	Gallagher	James	108	WFR0WnMhSS0	967	989	And there's a serious problem we need to address together as a community to ensure that there is access. But that it's, also that this is done in a proper way so that we encourage compliance not punish people. But we encourage compliance. And I think everybody can agree on that. You know, I'm going to support the bill.
4793	Chavez	Rocky	83	7UjH6y-2-HM	2437	2448	Well we know, just as the Chairman does, having been an educator himself, and myself seven years in it, if you're going to institute something in the fall of '16, you need to have that in the spring.
4794	Hertzberg	Robert	99	hp2WTRF5hkg	216	232	The list of these people here are jobs in the California who are losing their contracts because those renewable jobs and that, that world shifting. We have matured this process over time since Fran's bill way back when in 20 cent, percent RPS, and where it's going, and technology's matured.
4795	Huff	Bob	105	9eA3HqZp1ws	1086	1113	And so, you have before us an opportunity to recognize the new lunar year, which begins in February 19th. So while we celebrate new year in pretty much one night, in a day, they spread it out over a few weeks and it's recognized by billions around the world. But here in California, it's predominantly celebrated millions of Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese and this year ushers out the year of the Horse and in with the year of the Ram.
4796	Frazier	Jim	114	-_4-MnSxShM	988	1005	The purpose of this bill is to deal with derelicts. Wrecks, hulks, and parts of ships that are no longer truly vessels, and pollute our state waterways. Although current law provides the authority for a Sheriff to deal with wrecked property, and abandon vessels, the current required procedures are both time consuming and very costly.
4797	Leno	Mark	60	aXebDhCekK4	1446	1468	I think it needs to be said that what we're doing here today is clearly a first step that unfortunately we don't know if we're in the fourth year of a four year drought or the fourth year of something much more devastating. So, there's going to be a lot more to be done and of course we've got our own budget process through June 15th-
4798	Huff	Bob	105	9eA3HqZp1ws	1113	1141	Now on that point, sometimes you'll see Ram, sometimes you'll see Sheep, sometimes you'll see Goat. Explain to me that in the Chinese word, it doesn't distinguish. It's one or the other. So if you like ram, fine, if you like sheep, that sounds like it's a little timid, but it's all the same word. So today you have something that I put out to you that says year of the ram, which we found to give you a sense of what goes with that heritage.
4799	Wood	Jim	72	dfinQbvsuZo	58	67	So for example, you could go to a clinic and have a medical visit and a dental visit, however if went to a clinic and asked for a medical visit and you needed
4800	Ting	Philip	30	qapPMGGQ0rI	1940	1957	So, well, I'm firmly I'm confident that they will eventually get their job done. I also feel that the measures that we've really put forward are very modest and simple and common sense here that really should apply regardless of who our accrediting body is.
4801	Wieckowski	Bob	55	kmqs1i5uyec	564	607	Okay. A hundred questions. Can we anticipate that the department is going to come back to us in the out years beyond 2019 and 2020, because as we develop laws, or you do investigations, the level of clean up on some of these sites that the federal government has made may not pass California mustard, if I can put it in that fame. Because we're already at $15 million shortfall, but we may for health reasons and the whole plethora of rules that we have here, is that I don't know if that's part of the work planets. I'm making more work here instead of -
4802	McGuire	Mike	93	sy4t4DpLFas	293	310	As a result, California has taken the position, intentionally to forego any revenue from new offshore oil development due to the unacceptably high risk, and has instead focused on developing clean renewable energy, and I do want to say thank you to Senator Pavley for her amazing leadership on that.
4803	Gaines	Ted	24	XSL2yLxKUCc	588	604	So, again, I've got cattle, strawberry plants, alfalfa, all sorts of things, seed from Assembly Member Dahle, in Lassen county, so we'll continue to cheer you on and hopefully, be successful in crafting a good bill.
4804	Stone	Mark	20	1wxe7O9piQI	1745	1787	I think another public interest that's important there. And I'd also like to distinguish the statement of government officials is of course to set that in record straight, it's not all government officials and certain classes of government officials, police officers and judges. Those who it has been established have a higher vulnerability to being targeted by folks who might carry guns and I don't think other  government official such as elected officials like ourselves or others have the same standing as the police officers do nor I think do the general public. So, I'll just let you know I'm not going to be supporting your bill. Other comments, questions by committee members? Mr. Gallagher.
4805	Thurmond	Tony	4	_NbeI7--ZiA	185	253	Thank you. The, I mean, from a, I'm looking at this bill from the lens of someone who's had to take time off to care for our family member. And from the lens of what I think is really good family values. We define our families as grandparents in our families. We don't throw them out. We ask our grandparents to take care of our children, so that we can work or so they have the benefit of access to the grandparents. And so from my standpoint, this is just an extension of that for other family members in that many ways this could create savings for the State. If, someone can't get the time off to care for extended family, grandparent, domestic partner, they may very well be forced to put that family member in an institution that's gonna cost more for their care. But I want to ask you about some of the things that you said in your testimony on behalf of the chamber. And I think it relates to some of the questions from my colleagues about the threshold number for businesses. And I get it, we want to do things to support our small businesses, right?
4806	Allen	Benjamin	70	7wM-SWUAGJQ	1396	1411	Thank you Madam President and members. This bill will streamline the complex billion reimbursement process for California's community health clinics that dispense medication to MediCal patients and ensure that clinics are being fairly reimbursed for the important services that they provide.
4807	Allen	Benjamin	70	9GlTqPUGK00	746	769	Now we know this section dredge mining causes, can cause, serious environmental impacts. The power equipment used by section dredgers to vacuum up the stream beds causes a plume of, can cause, a plume of mercury sentiment to travel downstream, which can be harmful to water quality, public health major species, and cultural sites.
4808	Pan	Richard	96	pvvkVbDJBVE	1145	1160	As a theatre director, he created interesting compelling theater while passing on his wisdom and passion for the art. Every actor who performed in one of his productions remembered it forever. As a respected actor in the Sacramento area, he could portray a role with elegance and finesse.
4809	Hancock	Loni	98	FmUMuqWK62w	755	791	They support it and they really love the woman who worked for over a decade to put it together and institutionalize it at this prison. It changes the culture of the prison and it changes the lives, as you can see by the recidivism rate of the men that go through the program.
4810	Monning	Bill	25	uUsytMtXn1I	1093	1107	There's a number that correlates it to the data bank, but anyone doing research on the blood spot doesn't have access to the child's name or the family name. Is that your understanding?
4811	Patterson	Jim	119	79bMZ-eNloc	1482	1500	There are a lot of things we can do and are willing to do, but it feels as if we are being penalized by an arbitrary benchmark without any consideration with respect to what is in the pipeline and what we've already done to see these consumption numbers come down.
4812	De Leon	Kevin	102	-v1uD0LX8sQ	128	145	This bill is supported by millions of Californians who want their leaders to move us toward a clean energy future and thanks to our commitments and investments, Californians are breathing cleaner air and saving thousands of dollars each year under gas and utility bills
4813	Quirk	Bill	23	qCEr8jDp5Hg	793	805	In addition, besides the obvious debt that we have, the debt that's called debt, we also have the fact that our pensions are not properly funded at this time.
4814	Weber	Shirley	44	ELlYlrBZUfQ	935	947	Health care receiver has said that no matter what we do, with all the other challenges we face, if we don't shut this one down, it's gonna cost us $1.5 billion to repair a prison that we probably don't need
4815	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	2aR0NxdG4rc	93	112	Last fall, the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate Environmental Quality Committee, of which Senator Hill was then the chair, sent a joint letter to various CEQA stakeholders, in fact over 40 of them, if I'm not mistaken, asking for their input on how to improve the CEQA process.
4816	Pavley	Fran	104	cRT-vVNBfAE	745	759	They're starting with the highest priority wells that are in areas where there's water that could be used for drinking water, either now or in the future, or agricultural purposes both for beneficial uses.
4817	Kim	Young	82	WBiuNzDlh60	456	466	Miss Kim, I can probably clear this up 'cause either way, it's a mandate. So, I mean, the mandate question has been answered and it's affirmative on either proposition. Did you wish to comment further? If you could quickly.
4818	Lara	Ricardo	107	y1QKa01q6Wg	2355	2367	And I appreciate your continued ongoing work in SB 4. I'm very proud and honored to be a principal co-author with you on this bill. And with that, we have a motion of do pass as amended to Appropriations with a second. Madame Secretary, please call the roll.
4819	Weber	Shirley	44	CEtC6uXpjsc	116	135	So the comparison between in state and out of state students, if there is a disparity, and it doesn't lean in the favorable sense, then it may be to the disadvantage of the University of California with regards its overall mission to actually recruit all of these out of state students who may not have the same drive as some of the other students.
4820	Pan	Richard	96	qg64LVJvp3Q	952	973	We also know, for example, in the outbreaks that have happened, I have some mentioned in my opening statement, in both the pertussis outbreak in 2010 as well as the measles outbreak, that began in Disneyland in December, the analysis done of those outbreaks show that they, that certainly high PBs were a factor.
4821	Nielsen	Jim	68	mtOf4NbcKRw	728	754	All right, thank you very much, gentlemen. We're going to have to proceed to the next panel, but we may have some additional questions. Thank you very much. Okay, this next panel, workload involving the demographics. Dana Cummings, Ted Puntillo and Ruth Wong. Dana, why don't you start out.
4822	Thurmond	Tony	4	3I7f3vKVAeA	1624	1646	The goals of this bill say that California always has been and should continue to be a leader and that includes on the climate front. What we do in California has an impact on the rest of our country and on the rest of the world and certainly on the children of our communities, and I strongly urge your support for SB 350.
4823	Thurmond	Tony	4	3I7f3vKVAeA	1606	1624	I heard many people say well it doesn't go far enough or doesn't do this or doesn't do that, why didn't you focus on this, but they don't talk about the goals. The goals established in this bill say that we do have a challenge in our state, in our country, and in our nation.
4824	Pavley	Fran	104	b4USpkALPiM	1858	1874	The technologies and the signals we send will help us achieve those kinds of reductions. I don't know about you, but frankly, when I started on this journey in 2002, we had all these hearings on findings and looking at the science.
4825	Chavez	Rocky	83	xxo2ATBDxJE	1543	1566	You come back, you're reinstated to your job, but there is no longer any funding for you, so you don't get your job. There's no hourly payment for you. What this bill will take care of, is that loophole required that when a reservist comes back to California, even though they're hourly, they'd be able to receive their pay, I'd ask for your support.
4826	Bonta	Rob	85	EmQFEn7-288	13	40	I thank you for your leadership on this issue, Mr. Calderon, I really appreciate it. I couldn't agree more about the annual inspections for childcare facilities as a father who has had kids in childcare facilities for the last 15 years, just recently aged out when my youngest went to kindergarten, the idea of having only the complaint driven approach, as opposed to a set annual inspection worries me and I think we need to do better for our children.
4827	De Leon	Kevin	102	X8PioJ1D-Ko	1660	1681	That is a remarkable number to have 90% of at least a projected number. 90% within a 24 month, two year period. Walk us through how you were able to do that. And go as detailed as possible. Technically speaking, how were you able to do this?
4828	Pan	Richard	96	2iFsom3zoYY	1358	1375	but as a pediatric dentist, what is the standard of care in terms of number of visits, and what age does the start? Because I think they made a comment about few dentists will actually accept them at three years of age, but my understanding as a pediatrician, that actually the first visit should take place earlier than that.
4829	Hill	Jerry	66	FVQ4YG_BqFE	342	365	I appreciate it, thank you Mr. Chair and members, SB 494, I'm sorry, SB 135, by Senator Padilla, enacted in 2013, requires the Governor's Office of Emergency Services to develop a comprehensive statewide earthquake early warning system based on public-private partnerships. The law says the general fund cannot be used for this system.
4830	Williams	Das	12	_Z7ChiMRbIg	1176	1204	Mr. Bonta, why don't you come on up? But before we take up Mr. Bonta, we did have an item that we met in subcommittee, Mr. Bigelow's item 6 by Bigelow AB 301. This is his state responsibility area's fire prevention fee mechanism. The chair, the committee's amendments change the mechanism, but preserve the spirit of bill he presented.
4831	Anderson	Joel	57	ZhE_hzRecAQ	1694	1715	And I think that's one of the big tripping points here. I don't think there's anybody on this floor that is against voter participation. That's all how we got here. So I don't think that we're against that, but we don't know for a fact that that program is online, because it isn't, and that it's working efficiently
4832	Harper	Matthew	14	OHndMPLrpTA	1181	1208	Under the visa program, right? And so as I learn about this body and learn about the culture that we have here, one of my concerns is and you can comment on this or not is are we placing a broader priority or broader inclusiveness on unskilled, undocumented immigrants rather than skilled documented immigrants.
4833	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	JT1Tm7zEIWc	468	490	And once you get rid of the lawyers, you have anarchy. And for those who hate laws, and hate the state and hate government and order, that's the first thing they want to get rid of. And I'm, look, I know a lot of lawyers. Some of them I like, some of them I don't like, like anybody else. But I just think in this case there's an imbalance here. It's not right. It's not fair and it needs to be corrected.
4834	Mullin	Kevin	31	4tou47dRNaA	1658	1670	Thank you, Ms. Waldron, without objection we're taking voice votes on the amendments. All those in favor say aye, oppose say nay, the ayes have it, and the amendments are adopted. Bills out to be printed back on file.
4835	Anderson	Joel	57	vEySB-JPx9Q	127	146	But, when they finish their sentence, they're released whether they received programming or not. So what we're doing is we're denying these people an opportunity to improve themselves. We're denying them the opportunity to return to society as productive members.
4836	McGuire	Mike	93	aMmnutMx8lk	261	278	And he spearheaded the effort to create one of Sonoma County's most beloved parks Annadel in the late 1970s. In fact, many believe that Trione's most significant and enduring contributions to Sonoma County and the state of California is the creation of Annadel State Park.
4837	Stone	Jeff	26	yiLVh_sTRu0	1285	1310	Thank you, for your presentation. Just a few questions. In looking at your table on, page 29 to 39, State Hearing Penalties by Program for the past five years. In 2012-2013, there was quite a spike there. A total of almost $4.3 million in penalties.
4838	Hueso	Ben	48	CKAXbjP6mGQ	1297	1320	Thank you Mr President and Senators, I also rise in support of the Pro Temp's measure. SB 350 is an energy plan for the future. We are California, the Golden State. In California we have found ways to turn sunlight into gold, to turn wind into gold, to turn steam from the ground into gold.
4839	Lara	Ricardo	107	u9WQRBoV7yg	1468	1479	Thank you members. We're moving to motions and resolutions. Senator Anderson, on this item or do you have a seperate? On this item or do you have a separate adjournment.
4840	Chiu	David	7	-C1RVRucLcc	1497	1507	So, I do hope the working group will be analyzing and understanding and gathering that data, wondering if that is part of the work plan, and look forward to hearing from the working group.
4841	Weber	Shirley	44	hTPaXL_VY8w	1354	1368	And so, this would at least keep it on the mind of our institutions that they have a responsibility to not just be a thermometer that measures the, the climate of campuses, but be a thermostat to determine the, the campus climate itself.
4842	Stone	Mark	20	NPktHkkmjlQ	1325	1341	But the same kind of issue is once we're at the end, and that the business has failed or is failing. We're asking a lot of that business or those individuals at that point that may not necessarily be there. So, if you could. I think that's the questions. Address that in your close.
4843	Stone	Jeff	26	HgBIr1hupMw	2230	2245	I'm just suggesting a non archaic representation of what that is. It may be the 85th percentile of 2014 minus 22%. I don't know. Maybe it's a political thing. Oh, my god. You're cutting us back 22% of what the average is for taking care of these kids.
4844	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	A_iRTPZL_LQ	533	545	Here today to testify and support is, again, Ignacio Hernandez, who is representing the California Attorney for Criminal Justice and Lizzie Buchen for the Center for Juvenile and Criminal Justice. I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
4845	Lara	Ricardo	107	doJlNdYlHmM	7	29	Yes, you have AB 13. Oh, sorry that's right. Members, this is Assembly member Alejo presenting for Senator Cooper, that's AB 1042 which do have a recommendation, again it has a due pass recommendation.
4846	Steinorth	Marc	35	2w72Z1tf27E	357	385	And will help businesses proactively comply with ADA regulations. The Commission acts as a liaison to ensure access for the disabled while working with the businesses to make sure compliance is feasible. An increase in CCDA's funding will allow them to expand their educational and outreach efforts. This will help businesses come into compliance with ADA requirements rather than making those changes after costly litigation, and possibly delaying any of those corrections to occur.
4847	Gordon	Richard	117	xxo2ATBDxJE	418	438	Thank you. I have, weighed presentation on a couple of bills, but I would like to present AB 594. This bill would reduce redundancy and simplify discrete provisions within the Political Reform Act. Candidly, the Political Reform Act has become very complex, and in some instance, instances duplicative.
4848	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	ZurQFkaNhto	1136	1151	It specifies that school shall make available to its pupils adequate time to eat. It further specifies that if a school determines it is currently not providing pupils with adequate time to eat, a school, in conversation with the district, shall identify and develop a plan to increase pupils' time to eat.
4849	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	nugSHhjUz14	1903	1917	And then finally, there's about $5 million to support the implementation and enhancement of body cameras throughout the state. Where again, we're imposing a lot of body camera regulations on the locals.
4850	Cooper	Jim	21	elRk6CudldM	1718	1732	And that stuff does go on, but it's gone on for years and it's really hard to enforce. So, you know, do I support more regulation? Absolutely, but I think we gotta bring the folks together and work on something. But, I think it's much needed, I support your bill, Mr. Gordon, but I think we need some tweaks.
4851	Thurmond	Tony	4	A6ledtIW6-Y	1795	1809	Director Rogers, did you want to add, I know that there are, this all has to ultimately get embedded in legislation. This committee won't be taking those actions today, but individually as members of the legislature we will have that opportunity.
4852	Chu	Kansen	32	IbDqH1ykNPs	1522	1535	Which we have heard of maybe sort of tip of the iceberg. And I want to get a sense of what sort of estimates are there and what the potential longer-range costs are around hepatitis C and how did you pick three hundred-million to start with.
4853	Bonta	Rob	85	qq3Eh5yZRaM	1721	1736	Do any members wanna make any remarks before we close? Okay, thank you. We've had a long, robust, informative hearing. Really appreciate all of the participation from everyone here today. Thank you to all of our panelists, once again, for your testimony and your insight.
4854	Bloom	Richard	2	FoNfxHNdVgI	245	266	This conversation, I think, is extremely important for us to have here in this Committee. We are so caught up in allocating money to address a problem that sometimes we forget to think about the problem itself and process what that means in terms of how we allocate our funding.
4855	Gaines	Ted	24	47vy5JeX0sg	689	710	It is my honor to present along with Assemblyman Brian Dahle joint member resolutions commending each of these firefighters who bravely continued to fight the Boles fire, despite having received word that their own homes were burning. I cannot think about finer example of public service.
4856	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	FVQ4YG_BqFE	1888	1914	Yes. We're gonna I've discussed further, but the point is to leave this up to the fire marshal. It is their jurisdiction and their responsibility. So we've been discussing with the fire marshal what their needs are. In order to be able to continue inspecting, to be able to do it safely. And also to protect against these spills. Again, that's the bottom line.
4857	Stone	Mark	20	w-20_U9xFyk	1491	1509	Okay, because we do have tools like form 700 and others that help facilitate the disclosures. And when you're dealing with contractors, do you ask contractors to do the same thing with their subcontractors to be able to report about race, gender?
4858	Bonilla	Susan	3	LgmGhqrlHbk	245	256	It's wonderful to say "oh technology is just going to solve all of our problems." And then there is the human component, the human reality that maybe it isn't going to solve all the problems.
4859	Liu	Carol	63	JxGEdNdnkQ4	1811	1831	Okay. Okay that bill is out. All right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, what was Cooper again?  9-0 that bill is out. Item 16 was pulled by the author. Item 17, AB 1101, Bonilla.
4860	Roth	Richard	106	UtqZNbCPgNM	952	968	I mean, recognizing that if your wait time is twice as long as the wait time at Inland, California, for example, St. Bernadines, it may be because you have a different business model, you have a different geographic and demographic situation.
4861	Gaines	Ted	24	162iDtQT3ZE	676	698	OK. When I looked at that issue, I thought, well, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency is kind of an extremely unique multi-state organization that-- it's not the same as a regular transit agency. Is that correct, Senator Gaines? It's kind of a special creation of the ... and federal law
4862	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	-OpN4Uo7BxE	2123	2138	I'm sorry, that's the cost of freedom, quite frankly, so I hope I have addressed everybody's issues, this is a good bill, this is the bill that the Secretary of State has sponsored, that he wants to see implemented, and I respectfully ask for an aye vote.
4863	Monning	Bill	25	Ml25eXE1TpQ	285	325	Thank you, and along those lines, I've, as a, somebody addicted to NBA basketball on TV, I've had the benefit of seeing some of those e-cigarette commercials. They're very effective. Powerful. Great to see it up there and California Department of Public Health. I am interested in, it appears in that the trends of young people under 18 getting addicted to nicotine through e-cigarettes, its now surpassed entry through smoking products. Is that correct?
4864	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	hGRwdCC6_e8	1159	1186	Thank you Mr. Speaker AB678 provides funding to our state ports so they may invest in energy efficiency projects, improve the quality around the ports and continue the efforts to be green. These investments will not only further reduce the environmental impacts associated with ports, but have the potential to lower port operating cost resulting in approved competitiveness and job growth in our State, I respectfully ask for your Aye vote.
4865	Hueso	Ben	48	MFaUCCPTn6I	748	779	There seems to be some kind of, you know, back room deal between them saying, you know, I'll provide-- I'll charge you more but as long as you continue to increase your prices as well-- so that their suppliers can-- it just seems that-- I just see a very odd effect happening there that I don't think it's necessary in the public's interest and the consumer's interest. How is that possible? Is that some you can do something about?
4866	Garcia	Cristina	112	uprCp-AfCts	1981	2000	This bill is aimed at the situation where appointees would be serving out terms as long as three plus years. In this situation an appointee would serve in an elected position without ever being elected by voters for a very long time. This simple fix represents, would allow voters to have a voice.
4867	Beall	Jim	92	Wk2WIga5Dho	1600	1611	I'd like to accept the amendments suggested in the analysis to clarify that observation services continue to be provided in emergency department without being limited to the 24 hour limit.
4868	Leno	Mark	60	1VsIgdliTQw	728	755	It will make sure that these farm workers stay in a private plan and don't become the responsibility of the state, which would cost us even more money than this investment will. It's a very thoughtful, fiscally sound policy decision. I ask for your aye vote.
4869	Beall	Jim	92	IUqqKj1b5UE	1558	1567	I want to point out that just the discussion that we have indicates one thing to me. And that we need to define some things, we need to set some parameters.
4870	Rendon	Anthony	120	n2kpAc_U7tc	25	41	By monitoring, monitoring compliance with previously adopted laws. In this way a sessions legacy is made not just by the enactment of new laws, but also by its efficacy and holding the executive branch accountable for how to administers current law.
4871	Alejo	Luis	9	gnd2v7Ro_Uo	303	323	If we don't fix our existing neighborhoods, then cities will sprawl outward, worsening costly problems like traffic and greenhouse gas emissions. And I have worked tirelessly on this concept for the last three years. And although the Governor did not sign AB 2280 last year, I'm optimistic that he will sign AB 2 this year, given the technical changes we have made to address his office's concerns.
4872	Beall	Jim	92	4mB1nCFXohc	1341	1372	So we have to redo especially the early planning and management of these projects because that's where the that's where the lack of clarity, the lack of the, how would you say? They spend too much time. They don't spend enough time doing careful planning for these projects. And then they end up spending more money when the project goes the wrong way later.
4873	Liu	Carol	63	MNZk1vD2pGo	0	153	All right. We have two authors left, neither of which I see in the room. We can take a 3-minute break or they're going to lose their bill. How about that? Yes. We'll have a 3-minute break, or 2-minute break. If there's nobody present, we will hold the bills till next week. Sound good to you? I don't see any uprise in the audience. They're not here for the bill. Test. Thank you, Senator Mendoza.
4874	Obernolte	Jay	86	mzRsScITOGM	1341	1350	So even though we are going from a weaker to a stronger standard, you are going from an objective of standard to a subjective standard. Could you address that concern?
4875	Ting	Philip	30	lri5mYqnVgw	146	168	My city, San Francisco, we've seen the city of San Jose, have really moved to the forefront of how to set an example to work with these innovation economies and companies, but at the same time, really make sure we are collecting the revenues owed and that we can maintain and reach agreement on those revenues that are owed.
4876	Fuller	Jean	49	oDMixRIfl_Y	1151	1170	So my hope is that you will rethink the answer that I received yesterday, that a. to me didn't include any public reports, didn't include any public engagement, was much more about data collection.
4877	Hancock	Loni	98	bzJzCS8XdVc	789	814	These protective orders include emergency protective orders or restraining orders mainly designed to prevent physical harm and abuse. And in the case of restraining orders it presumes the victim has the ability to initiate the request. However, cases of elder and dependant adult abuse are often complex.
4878	Weber	Shirley	44	0LdXFnPqPCk	1139	1161	And so, when I look at that we should all be strengthened by that fact that this country has something so valuable, something so important, a democracy that supposedly respects every individual, that people have fought so hard just to be not the top, not the middle, but just to be considered the average individual to be a part of this country.
4879	Thurmond	Tony	4	XHIZ_X2Rz9c	495	511	Why has this been allowed to be an issue for ten years or more, I assume it's longer. But why are we on the same conversation for 10 years, when we know that people are suffering, that people have illnesses, that people aren't getting good care? Why? I know you have something for us.
4880	Chavez	Rocky	83	P8Zs2L1mwlY	1224	1243	You know, that's okay. Cuz we hope they'll come back for our graduate programs. But the, this is a great country, and we have that activity going out there, so, I will be supportive of you as you go forward with this I think. I agree that 32 million doesn't sound right, but in the same token, we're talking billions, so, thank you for what you're doing.
4881	Ting	Philip	30	n6Y2Iw6dcYo	602	624	Well thank you so much for joining us here today. My apologies for running a little late. I was interested in hearing a little bit more about the reasons that you aren't collecting data around limited English speaking businesses. In particular, you oversee the nail salon industry which I think is
4882	Lara	Ricardo	107	CfbKdUW5Buw	11	27	This bill, and Senator de Leon's SP654 will, which will, I'll present later, both make essential improvements to the permitting procedures at DTSC to better protect residents living in vulnerable neighborhoods near hazardous waste facilities.
4883	Stone	Jeff	26	nfRac3nHOas	1106	1115	In some cases, we've had county prisoners that have been sentenced and would have otherwise gone to state prison for up to sixteen years in our local jails, which is a problem.
4884	Brown	Cheryl	13	hECme4j8edc	1488	1508	And, now would just like to call on any of the young people you've heard things that they can I get one of you to come up in comment on what you've heard?
4885	Hertzberg	Robert	99	E_gAhll2czw	1103	1144	Members if we can please rise and observe a moment of silence on behalf of the victims in Paris, France. Thank you, members. If there's no other business, Senator De Leon, the desk is clear. The Senate will be in recess, oh sorry.
4886	Hertzberg	Robert	99	Sai1lZPOK9g	679	701	Oh no, that wasn't with that. That was the response. Two quick things. One, this is not keyed fiscal but I'm told it's going to Aprops. Is that accurate? Is that true? Two, is there a particular case that you have in mind for this? I mean, it seems to me that this measure is about a case or individual cases.
4887	Hertzberg	Robert	99	DT3707YnrIQ	1438	1462	7-0 consent, file is out. Okay. Okay, we've gotta wait for Senator Lara and Senator Pavley for a moment, but do we have any that we can do with them already on here? All right, well they were here earlier. Well here comes Senator Lara. The man in gold.
4888	Gomez	Jimmy	80	11yyICoQ5m8	1902	1914	Actually I think that maybe they've seen the light and understand that this program is not a fringe program, but something that's fundamental to working families here in California. Even in their districts.
4889	Levine	Marc	8	t0t13B_zyEs	384	401	It only makes sense for us to find out if we have a tool that will address the two most pressing problems in the state in a simple fashion, and in a way that preserves, protects, and supports agriculture. With me today in support of the bill are Torri Estrada and Doctor Jeffrey Creque of the Carbon Cycle Institute.
4890	Stone	Jeff	26	34DjaBqbEpQ	1523	1538	Maybe we have a grant program that provides those motorcycles for local government to use because we can get to the site much quicker on a motorcycle, and get those emergency responders there, that I know will save lives in the State of California and it would be a very small investment to make.
4891	Pan	Richard	96	BQgV9eqQ2Tw	965	977	Open data also boosts civic engagement. For example, governments have used open data to obtain feedback on public sector programs, such as the participatory budgeting efforts that increases involvement in the process.
4892	Allen	Travis	43	6nzz0SRNk10	167	180	Thank you Mr. Thurmond, seeing no discussion or debate on this item, the clerk will open the roll. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. The clerk will close the roll.
4893	Leno	Mark	60	xusZRk9gg60	1277	1301	And that will take care of our Prop 98 package. And colleagues, we do have issue one to deal with, which is conforming to everything we just voted on. Which is the package itself. And I would imagine that's 2-1? 2-1. Thank you for reminding me.
4894	Bates	Pat	58	gZ0_qo7XpYk	2355	2383	Yes. Don't know if it's the time of day. But the five-year standard updating every five years has me a little confused about what happens to those plants that are in the process. They started in year one and they're now in year three. And then, it's going to take them longer to be on up and operation by year five. Are they going to be subjected to new standards that are developed because technology has caught up? Or are those grandfathered? You know I'm not sure I--
4895	Mendoza	Tony	52	D_2wduB3Bxk	901	923	SB 599 will not only protect employee jobs and help our state's economic recovery, it will also protect good contractors from those that seek to be based on cost-cutting measures, which can jeopardize public transit service and employee protections.  With me to testify today is Shane Gusman for the California Teamsters.
4896	Pan	Richard	96	g_HgBg8yC5k	989	999	That bill is out, four to one. And finally, we have the consent calendar, of which there's only one item. SB 216 by Pan, the Public Employees Retirement System, the cleanup bill. Secretary, please call the roll of absent members.
4897	Chiu	David	7	RFWwgE7ubok	804	821	Thank you Mr. Chair. This is a bill in which I, actually I think I share the perspective of our Vice Chair. I've been active, an active member of the bar for almost 20 years. And it has been my perspective for most of that time, that this bar fee is way too high.
4898	Calderon	Ian Charles	115	llrxaJMn6L0	32	44	I also want to thank the California Medical Association for working with my office on additional amendments to ensure that AB 159 provides strong protections for patients and physicians.
4899	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	WYVStu1Ty2M	39	55	You students did a wonderful job out there being patient, listening, and hopefully learning as well. So Ms. Garcia, you will present your bill, and we will have five students speaking after you and then two adults as I understand it?
4900	Moorlach	John	4657	gnd2v7Ro_Uo	1182	1202	Thank you, Mr. Chair. In 2012, I was Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Orange County when redevelopment agencies were terminated, so we had to scramble immediately to get successor agencies put together. So I'm just kind of curious if you have some answers to some of the issues we've dealt with.
4901	Thurmond	Tony	4	b2XLo4I9yzU	50	83	We will take action on the others and I would ask the clerk if he would state each item. We'll vote on each of the remaining seven items individually. So, without objection, I'm gonna ask that we take one vote on all seven items without objection from anyone at the committee?
4902	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	KpERIVYvrj0	1260	1275	I have to go present, but I know that you need my vote as well. I wanna be clear. I actually agree conceptually with the opposition, and I think we had this discussion. I'm gonna, I recommended a, a moving this bill forward. I'm going to vote yes today.
4903	Chiu	David	7	ASNmI2rHU9I	855	873	And if I could just add to that, imagine the $300 million that we don't have, colleagues, to spend on other things. We all talk about needing to back-fill all the cuts to Medicaid That amount for that one drug would fill it in. And, and Gilliad made $10 billion this past year on that drug.
4904	Pavley	Fran	104	UOAgtw9idpM	1225	1273	Yes, thank you very much our members SB 13 is it really is just a clean-up bill. we found a few inadvertent mistakes the technical in nature that we need to clean-up in last year's ground water bill and this would make it clear fine amendments to the groundwater management bill and related sections of the water code, they include clarify that only high-end medium priority basins not within the management area of a groundwater sustainability agent agency or subject reporting requirements to the board clarify the noticing processor becoming a ground waters sustainability agency and correct cross references.
4905	Dababneh	Matthew	50	WgBOQU7UIHU	1060	1076	A digital driver's license would be a similar step towards providing a more convenient and safer option for our constituents. I have appreciated involvement and assistance of not only the DMV, the CHP, and numerous tech companies and tech associations in the process of drafting and developing this legislation.
4906	Chiu	David	7	sR3YZBZSyxQ	952	968	Seeing and hearing no further debate, the clerk will open the roll. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. Clerk will close the roll. Tally the vote, ayes 74, nos zero. Measure passes.
4907	Lara	Ricardo	107	_skeu0yft7s	1428	1440	But I'm proud that western growers are here. That our friends up and down the state to represent ag industry are willing to stick their neck out for their workers.
4908	Baker	Catharine	74	zuSJjHHSsa8	537	554	Mr. Chairman, you have been interested in following up as well, but, with respect to that radar beacon, by the Bay Bridge. If you can elaborate on your perspective about how important it is to have the beacons, and knowing that there are other systems in place and it does have a redundancy.
4909	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	OVIQdDmHNzI	881	908	So local fisherman are logically the best suited to immediately respond to an oil spill since they're on site. They know the water, the currents, and they are interested in protecting their economic interests in the ocean. If California had a program similar to the one in Prince WIlliam Sound, then a more comprehensive response could have started at least six hours sooner.
4910	Wood	Jim	72	eOaXlPRJTVY	1409	1426	Yes, and thank you, Mr. Bonta for bringing this forward, I appreciate that. I'm encouraged by the conversations around the independent dispute resolution process. I appreciate that. I know that you're going to continue to work on these issues, I will be supporting your bill.
4911	Beall	Jim	92	6q5JSfST1YQ	602	637	And it was done in a very scientific way like you would study a disease, you know, like where-- how the people died and what the morbidity factor were and so forth. So, what they did is they presented this report to our committee and basically concluded that if we can increase the number of use putting helmets on, it would reduce the injuries and the amount of--
4912	McGuire	Mike	93	m7M_S2jyhHc	0	10	Thank you so much. Mr. Director, any other items that you'd like to be able to, okay, thank you so much. I appreciate your patience there. We are now gonna be introducing Patricia Ryan.
4913	Melendez	Melissa	41	jRDlxywi7uQ	207	231	Earlier this year, this very same bill failed in this very House. I agree with the Governor's forewarning a few weeks ago that this Committee is not the appropriate venue for this major law change. This policy matter should be thoroughly thought out. It should be vetted in Committee and have extensive deliberation not injected into a special session. With that, Madam Chair I will yield the floor.
4914	Williams	Das	12	n5MXFS_19l0	55	79	AB 967 will now require California's public post-secondary systems, as well as each independent post-secondary institution to adopt and implement a consistent standard of discipline for students found responsible for campus sexual assault. Additionally, this bill would also require campuses to publicly report and disclose campus adjudication outcomes for sexual assault offenses.
4915	Moorlach	John	4657	AuGnonUgy28	955	969	Right, and I would think that this has been a healthy process and we're not just rubber stamps. That we do wanna add value. That we're just not waiting or passing it along to the next group. Right? So we wanna put some-
4916	Roth	Richard	106	0HDXR-Yl1D8	1237	1257	Unfortunately we know that's not usually the case. Actually, not only do many local government building departments not inspect to ADA standards, at least some, if not many inspectors are confused as to the actual ADA standards to be applied. This is not a good situation.
4917	Allen	Benjamin	70	_4l4q_6Hap0	1235	1246	But the good news is that with a second referral, there'll be more opportunities for discussion, and I do really fundamentally believe that you share the same concerns about these folks.
4918	Chang	Ling Ling	18	UUDrPWxX9_Y	2171	2185	It can be a real challenge to ensure attendance from each qualified city representative with a committee of that size and scope. This doesn't just lead to the frustration by mayors and council members who do attend, at least vacancies in very important public bodies.
4919	Lara	Ricardo	107	qbKF38sndDw	300	322	5 to 0. That item is out. Moving on to Assembly Debobnaybeginning with AB 221 Mobile Drivers License Visibility Study. Do pass to the Senate Floor. We will substitute the roll on AB 2. That was approved on a five to two vote with Republicans voting no. Moving on to AB 1261 Advanced Manufacturing Sales Tax Credit Exemptions. Do pass to the Senate Floor. Secretary please call the roll.
4920	Weber	Shirley	44	0JpwnSkUZnE	1935	1947	And I think we have to say that to many of our directors, and program directors, and contractors and others that when you have the will, it happens, but it will not happen without it. And that's real clear that it just does not happen by osmosis.
4921	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	5kU8DLIkLSI	1827	1851	Once an officer's out, how do we then connect that, so you get a panoramic view of what's going on? But we did not receive any requests. No department came to us to say, look, we also need to put more cameras on our vehicles. That wasn't anything that was requested by any law enforcement or even the public. It was specifically about body cameras.
4922	Fuller	Jean	49	CW6mZhhMcnU	121	136	I think the other thing should be that instead of annual it should be as an emergency, or mystery pollutants, or something like that that defined it so that it couldn't become just anything and then we find ourselves without money.
4923	De Leon	Kevin	102	oE98JCD72Xk	759	775	So that's why it's very important that we demystify and clarify a lot of the confusion that is meant to sort of distract folks from what is at stake here. And one thing too, I'll stop right there, because I'm sure I'll have more questions right there Mr. Chair, thank you for your indulgence.
4924	Stone	Mark	20	g465sM88Jms	22	52	There are lots of stories about some attorneys, a few attorneys, who are taking advantage of the ADA in order to essentially hold small businesses hostage. Those are the small businesses that need to get this information and if we can make it that more difficult as this bill would do to be successful in that arena we should be able to cut down on the number of lawsuits that are less than meritorious and are meant more just to collect money from the defendants. And with that, I respectfully request an aye vote.
4925	Ting	Philip	30	R3SMzNAvRKs	308	322	Again, these are specific rules that we are asking the non-profit to abide by. We're not creating any more bureaucracy. I do think as a legislative body we should be holding this agency accountable. Senators Nielsen and Beall have asked for an audit which was done completed last year.
4926	Mitchell	Holly	64	Fi4W0LVlb68	811	829	Of the two. Good point. Last initial question from me, Mr. Pro Tem. Another issue that is often debated here in the legislative arena through legislation. I served on Public Safety Committee, Public Safety Budget Subcommittee while I was in the Assembly my first year in the Senate.
4927	Allen	Benjamin	70	oTonvRu6EKM	1441	1458	But, I wasn't getting a sense of there was initially direction with regards to how much water was being used. And, are there possible ways that the board's thinking of alternative approaches that would allow jurisdictions to reduce the total amount of water used, but offer flexibility as to when the watering occurs?
4928	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	kMP7GilTLLE	1103	1134	The Attorney General's 2014 California Data Breach Report states that using the Flesch Kincaid Grade Level Index to assess readability of seven -- 70 randomly selected readability assessments shows that the average reading grade was college level in both years 14 -- in grade level 14 in 2012 and 13 in 2013.
4929	Garcia	Eduardo	38	OHndMPLrpTA	729	741	I think that we should stand up as a governmental body and shed light on the problem. And again, I would respectfully ask that you and the members of this committee support that.
4930	Nguyen	Janet	65	-zapzAXTnLg	658	695	to the United States, but California and California politicians actually didn't want us. So it's actually interesting for me to see the debate that, you know, that over 30 years ago, we in California tried to stop refugees from coming to California. 30 years later standing in front of you, we uniting together as Californians to say there's a broken system in the federal government. Immigration needs to be respected and that we are all immigrants, whether immediately or our ancestors are.
4931	Stone	Jeff	26	npLG8Ena6eQ	629	645	There are no medical protocols that any physician or pharmacist can guarantee that does not cause pain and suffering. As a medical professional, I would say there is no proof that death is a painless process. What is an aid in dying drug on page two of this bill.
4932	Stone	Jeff	26	Pt2Dhj6vkoE	1717	1743	And here, we're talking about giving raises to people that aren't necessary and we're also talking about raising $3 to $6 billion in taxes to pay for infrastructure. Are you still stand by that analysis, number one? And number two, I believe through Ms. Spears legislation in the past that do you require a certain amount of time to go over these things, especially MOUs.
4933	Leno	Mark	60	RLVvRo75HJI	852	875	This is public employment relations board staffing the Governor and the Senate had no proposals. The Assembly did have $1 million. Half a million to cover current projected deficit and then some smaller amounts to deal with the system itself. Senator Lara?
4934	Pavley	Fran	104	Ab32yuFXwvM	1068	1085	They're doing a good job, and they continue to do it, and we need to fund them more frankly, to make sure we protect our water supplies. I'm concerned about Board of Supervisors continuing to offer well permits, without really looking at where the ground water basins are. They have maps, I assume.
4935	Hancock	Loni	98	KWZIJnQ_cGk	44	61	Think about the money to be saved, the lives to be saved, the victims not to be victimized and the stability of our communities that we can create if we can bring this to scale.
4936	Mathis	Devon	75	KbV7aq9eFHo	315	332	Good afternoon Madam Chair and members. Today, I'm here to present AB 75, a bill that will permanently fund 36 veteran claim representative positions in the CalVet Veteran's service division.
4937	Fuller	Jean	49	8s6GBqKeNwE	263	282	knowing you that you will do that with them because you're a very detailed oriented person. So I'm willing to vote for this today on the basis that this is a failure to act. When I was a school superintendent, knew other superintendents who just failed to act and they got into a lawsuit with people.
4938	Mitchell	Holly	64	yp3pHtPtFfM	698	711	Where that has a direct impact on the pocket book, of a mother living in poverty in terms of our ability to pay for childcare or pay for food or pay her utility bill.
4939	Nazarian	Adrin	36	378WZJyyxT0	611	623	Thank you. And before that, I just wanna make sure since we had some folks from local jurisdictions here, is there anyone in the room that would like to make an additional public comment at this time?
4940	Beall	Jim	92	2tOIPOStcDA	661	693	Good morning committee members. Mr. Chairman, it's my pleasure to present SB 311. This is a district bill. It would approve a pilot project in Alum Rock Union's elementary school district located at, in East San Jose part of my district. The pilot would extend the hours of Park Day State Preschool with the use of existing funds. The bill sunsets on January 1st, 2022.
4941	Melendez	Melissa	41	_ES7C4KFvkc	1836	1849	What I'm hearing is that there have been no districts identified that would use this money. But also that this is just a start in funding the need that exists. That's what I heard.
4942	Hernandez	Roger	37	voBhKCc4qds	125	144	It ensures that these agreements will not be required as a condition for employment. It prohibits an employer from discriminating or retaliating against any employee who refuses to sign such an agreement. And lastly, it ensures that such agreements are knowing, they're voluntary, and they're in writing.
4943	Beall	Jim	92	X49dPLJib5g	1219	1237	But there was an aversion to land use having the platform service land use regulation. I'm, I know the land use regulation issues well because I served on the planning commission in San Jose, I four and a half years I chaired the commission. I'm a planner.
4944	Beall	Jim	92	6UU1hF1F-fc	57	100	They are AB 587, item number five on our agenda. This means we will not hear those items today, okay? AB 904, item 13 is the other item. We'll not hear those items today. So we will proceed with in file order. And- We will start with item 17 at the request of assemblyman Ting.
4945	Hernandez	Roger	37	KbV7aq9eFHo	2016	2035	I thank you for all the expressed support, I just want to simply say, the, Staff Sergeant Trey Bunker was very modest not only did he successfully serve us and our country through five tours, but he has successfully navigated through the community college system, be cause of a veteran's resource center that was there.
4946	Mullin	Kevin	31	ch3qK2_FbyA	1599	1610	Is that a point of order Mr. Santiago? That's a point well taken, Mr. Santiago. Mr. Jones, please confine your comments specifically to this bill in front of us today.
4947	Beall	Jim	92	fSCMT0VJDKw	620	635	Thank you. I think the one thing the two chairs of the legislative Transportation Committee have is we've both lost family members in auto accidents, so I support this.
4948	Mitchell	Holly	64	xL36G7ytN6U	954	986	Senator Hill replaces the call. Returning to Senate third reading. Senator Leno, would you like to take up file item 133 before you return? File item 133, Senate Bill 322, Mr. Secretary, please read.
4949	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	eibZ1b56Plc	1084	1097	They're not my amendments, but I recognize and appreciate OSPR's been working very closely with us, as has the Department of Fish and Wildlife. This has all been done in good faith, and that's part of my frustration.
4950	Gordon	Richard	117	6qpSAuN2om0	207	225	I'd be happy, if the bill moves from Committee as I wouldn't want to take amendments here, I'd be happy to take a look at that before we get to the floor. I would note that the language in this bill has been the same language in a whole host of community food production bills.
4951	Monning	Bill	25	t-uCy9GJSIM	1407	1419	So, I'm just curious if in your data collection, do you know the purpose of traffic stops that add into the data collection of characteristics of stops and suspects?
4952	Mullin	Kevin	31	ytuWCZu3NdM	155	176	A quorum is present. We ask our guests and visitors in the rear of the chamber and in the gallery to please stand for the prayer. The day's prayer we offered by our Assembly chaplain, Father Constantine Pappademos. Father Pappademos?
4953	Bonta	Rob	85	6ril8VUEbBs	42	78	On our consent calendar, the following bills are proposed for consent. Item number 3 SB 123, Senator Lou. Item number 5 SB 276, Senator Wolk. Item number 10 SCR 59, Senator Galgianni. And item number 11 SJR 7, Senator Hann. We have our first item on the calendar is item number 1 SB 115, Senator Fuller on Valley Fever. And, we're gonna start as a sub-committee as, we don't yet have a forum. Senator Fuller, whenever you're ready.
4954	Bloom	Richard	2	F-p1mvX3SdQ	482	505	And it's really time that we move forward on these modern technology options that are out there. Include things like night vision capabilities, which will allow the helicopters, which do not currently have the capacity to fight fires during the daytime hours and the nighttime hours.
4955	Pan	Richard	96	Ew5hLn0iC0U	507	517	Now, internally we know there's federal guidelines they have to follow, etcetera, but I just sorta feel like the state needs to be able to intervene if there's a problem.
4956	Wolk	Lois	94	RM5OAEIHO1U	884	898	All right let's go back to the trailer bill language and the action on these items. First of all are there any questions, on any of this for our three testifiers?
4957	Bonta	Rob	85	6ril8VUEbBs	23	42	We have two items that were removed from the calendar. The following bills have been removed from today's agenda at the request of the author. Item number nine, bill SB 746, Wouk, on food safety gristmills. And item number 12, SB 128, Wouk and Monning, on end of life.
4958	Hancock	Loni	98	EWeEnJTr700	180	211	And would add a cost of living adjustment. As we know, everything from milk to the minimum wage has increased and after a decade of flat funding these very, very necessary programs are stretched to the breaking point. And very concerned that they will either have to reduce the numbers of young people they serve or reduce the quality of the programs they provide.
4959	Bonta	Rob	85	oZrbKv34-B8	1426	1445	We have been working diligently with the stakeholders on this issue including DMHC and DOI, to determine a fair solution to this problem. The amendments the committee has proposed and we are accepting, establish a simple back hand solution with the creation of an independent dispute resolution process that is mandatory and binding by both parties.
4960	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	-_4-MnSxShM	703	722	Who is gonna decide this? Let's say I'm a community and I pass something because I truly believe it's a question of safety. But the hunting organization, no that's not what you're doing at all. Do you end up in litigation over that to determine whether or not the ordinance is valid?
4961	Wolk	Lois	94	hUewX1j74kY	6	57	Cap-and-trade in general and then we'll move on to part B which will focus on high-speed rail alone. Just some housekeeping we will, we do not have any recommendations to move items forward other than to hold them open. for all departments for all issues and, at the very end of part A and part B, we will have public comment on any of those issues so we won't be doing it item by item just say, you know, so, you have time to prepare your public comment. Let's see, let's begin with an overall an overview of the cap and trade, and Senator Nelson will be here shortly. All right overview of the cap and trade program, welcome. We have finance and the LAO.
4962	Mitchell	Holly	64	U9EPCHTiWm8	828	844	Math mis-placement colleagues occurs when ninth grade students are held back to repeat their eighth grade math course despite having achieved a B grade or better or testing at proficient, or even advanced on state assessments.
4963	Stone	Jeff	26	npLG8Ena6eQ	199	210	I met with her oncologist and he told me that my mom is a complication to her cancer. Was going to go into a coma because it affected her parathyroid gland and he wanted to know whether he wanted me to have drugs administered to prevent her from going into a coma.
4964	Cannella	Anthony	61	_3f-5R48ZaU	713	722	So with that, again, Chairman Beall thank you very much for your hard work, and I agree with most of the comments you guys said today, so thank you for being here.
4965	Monning	Bill	25	EK6oKbTFoPo	1135	1168	I don't know if that's 1%, 15%, or 20%, but we do know that it is causal to certain birth defects that can result in lifelong disability and lifelong medical costs. Similarly with the suggested tax on sugar sweetened beverages, in earlier work that we did on that, the State Board of Equalization estimated that at a penny per ounce, it could generate 1.7 billion in revenue.
4966	Nielsen	Jim	68	XQwWN6GsS_M	360	372	Just in that, I'm not saying I'm opposed to this perspectively, but I see some complications in the implementation. I'll just reserve to abstain at this point. But thank you for the clarification.
4967	Lara	Ricardo	107	gXZO0cZqlQg	713	729	Thank you. With that objection this item will be moved to the suspense file. Thank you.  Assembly Member Dodd. Assembly Member Dodd you have AB 296, members is a do pass recommendation.
4968	Burke	Autumn	6	7KrRcZ9ORsY	1802	1813	So I just want to make that very clear that I have personally received information that I found not factual or that was not factual. So I just want to make sure that that is clear.
4969	Fuller	Jean	49	8L1SsBHKNBQ	911	935	And I appreciate the talking points that you gave me this morning, but I have to say that I was particularly disappointed that the talking points did not deal with that point at all. And the information concerning the voting on the fee. And your proposed amendments are not in the document.
4970	Chiu	David	7	D-f_MBSX4FM	445	457	that I asked of the first panel and, really trying to understand what you think state legislators ought to do, particularly those of us who believe that prop 209 needs to be
4971	Allen	Benjamin	70	7zfeQPMxSJ4	1374	1404	First by replacing just 10% of California's natural gas with renewable gas, that alone would reduce California's greenhouse gas emissions by 12.6 million metric tons from fossil fuel displacement alone, putting us a very-- a big step forward toward meeting the goals of both AB and SB 32. The actual emissions reduction would be much greater due to upstream reductions in black carbon from reduced wildfire for example.
4972	McGuire	Mike	93	X49dPLJib5g	888	904	And Mr. Lara thank you so much and you have my commitment. We actually put the hearing off from last week to this week to be able to allow for additional discussion as well. In my my word to you is that we are gonna continue working.
4973	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	-R4HGT4UbOs	1214	1228	Later on, I seem to recall Mike Gatto and Adrin Nazarian would join the ranks of council staff and become a part of Rick's world. Rick had an impact early on on many of us who are here today.
4974	Waldron	Marie	29	0pvN33z5LJg	1312	1333	As said, it's only very few, 1.3% of half of 1% of all prescriptions. So, and AIDS/HIV and antipsychotics already have carve-outs which can account for savings. There was 10 million that was put on this bill back the first bill which didn't have the utilization controls.
4975	Garcia	Cristina	112	x7WOzO1oE0M	23	41	Thank you. Before my opening statement, I want to address the amendment. While I am not taking the amendment today, it was brought to my attention by Mr. Chairman about consistency issues of how the DMV addresses these programs.
4976	Lara	Ricardo	107	-Ah0Dbgfor4	871	884	SB 252, waive high school test fees for homeless peoples. Do pass as amended to require that the implementation of fee exemptions does not result in an additional state cost. Secretary call the roll.
4977	Gomez	Jimmy	80	JgpqDSrKaXw	1748	1765	AB 870, Cooley, Homelessness Rapid Re-housing Pilot Program due passes amended to make a one time appropriation and have since that date. B roll call. AB 900, Levine, authorized guardianship for those eligible for special element juvenile status do pass. B roll call.
4978	Mitchell	Holly	64	7VfcnWx6nzU	73	86	It will require that more drug asset forfeiture cases be handled under state law, rather than transferred to federal courts in order to insure the stricter standards under California law are followed.
4979	Hertzberg	Robert	99	_H7zvwgU_3w	906	926	I know there's the political issues with respect to the governor's train and all those kinds of things and I make speeches on the floor briefly, I'll just say this. We always have these visionary things that were never good predictors of the future. We see it at the Hoover Dam, we saw it at the Bridge to Nowhere, which is the Golden Gate Bridge, the first bridge to nowhere, we always have those arguments.
4980	Pan	Richard	96	7sM6racHVJs	2181	2199	But I do appreciate the discussion and I will certainly be supporting the bill. I do think that the science is in support that saying that there is a rationale. At least for this bill. We can talk about the rationales for other things we should be doing. This is a very limited thing that we're doing, but I do think the rationale is there. Thank you.
4981	McGuire	Mike	93	LFikd5rYakY	919	931	Thank you so much better present I do want to say thank you to the Senator for all of her work on this issue along with our Republican colleagues for allowing myself to be able come into the caucus and talk about this important issue.
4982	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	6RcHSaSd1rw	439	458	Thank you Senator Beall. Any debate or discussion? Any debate or discussion? Seeing and hearing none, is there any objection to substituting a unanimous roll call? Seeing and hearing none, ayes 39 noes 0. Assembly amendments are concurred in five item 28 Senator he'll.
4983	Chavez	Rocky	83	YH8Avychtvs	999	1008	I know when I was over there, there was a couple of institutions. I wouldn't dime them out in the world right now, that I had been reported by your organization we're not doing what they were supposed to be doing.
4984	Pavley	Fran	104	E51em1yWGKw	663	680	The local government can decide by majority vote whether to adopt the initiative that allows the building, whether it's a football stadium, or whatever it is, it's broad and it's intent to move forward without CEQA compliance. Is that correct?
4985	Bates	Pat	58	vppxPTwkbs8	301	324	I'm Republican and I voted for our Measure M, both the original and M2. And I come from a part of Orange County that's very, very red. Don't vote for taxes, don't vote for fees. But our architects of our self-help were very, very good at describing where the money was going and I caution all of us.
4986	McGuire	Mike	93	9xlCmdTyLME	270	294	We all share I think the same goal which the Senators is working towards and that's focusing on livestock producers and keeping people healthy in antibiotics effective. It's going to be important, particularly for those who represent rural districts and have dairymen or cattlemen in those districts, that livestock producers continue to have access to antibiotics to treat and prevent diseases.
4987	Garcia	Eduardo	38	h8s0v2JD3F8	1222	1237	With me is Amy Wilson with the Labor and Workforce Development Agency along with Dan Rounds with the State Workforce Investment Board to add any details that you may be interested in hearing about. I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
4988	Garcia	Cristina	112	vyfz8Yq8ZGw	945	957	I also appreciate that you have full notices which is something that Mr. Cooper is also trying to address. What kind of background checks? How would this work? Are these going to be random background checks?
4989	Cooley	Ken	45	WL8066nF9bw	24	38	This bill would relinquish a portion of State Route 16 in between South Watt Avenue and Grant Line Road, that terminus Grant Line Road being several miles from the county line, so well within the county borders.
4990	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	Y0xkoNoudD0	698	710	There's a famous part of that that I always remember and this is probably more for the men in this room that whenever I get too much of myself as a man that I remember this quote. May I read, Madame Speaker?
4991	Roth	Richard	106	aa-UBR8QVvE	660	681	You know, in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and driving. Folks away from alliance on fossil fuels and considering bills to increase requirements and this and that, aren't we really putting the cart before the horse if we don't figure out how to fund transportation improvements at the same time?
4992	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	bB6-EJZQbO8	528	551	A child from a single-parent home who is loved and supported has no more problems than a child from a two-parent home. SCR 21 honors and recognizes the hard work, devotion, and sacrifice of today's many single parents and with that I would respectfully ask for your aye vote.
4993	Lara	Ricardo	107	GA4ZqtiJNoE	255	277	Now, California has the opportunity to once again demonstrate visionary leadership and to step beyond the limitations of a failed Congress. Let's provide a pathway to healthcare coverage for everyone in our state. And what we have-- what we've done since my bill of last year to contain cost, in this proposal I will delineate now.
4994	McGuire	Mike	93	ZWBFpMLdAlA	127	154	So just wanna be, I'd offer just a few words and then turn it right back over to the Chairman and Assemblywoman thank you so much for having me here today as well. And I think that we all know this, and despite the fact that our nation is emerging from the Great Recession four in ten Californians are still living in poverty. And in rural communities that I have the honor to be able to represent as well as in urban communities, that number can be larger. When accounting for the cost of living, California has the highest poverty rate in the nation.
4995	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	I1DeZTgw_DI	1329	1340	No, I already stated that our intent is to solely deal with hourly workers. However, it would apply to possibly the ticket takers, the janitors, the food service workers, and hopefully one day the cheerleaders.
4996	McGuire	Mike	93	ZWBFpMLdAlA	154	174	And we have more kids living in poverty in California per-capita than anywhere else in the United States. Nearly a quarter of all children in California did not have the resources to make ends meet in 2013. And I think we can all agree, and I do appreciate the Chairman, he's been a champion for this, we must do better.
4997	Weber	Shirley	44	xusZRk9gg60	774	796	I would simply add. I think, we've heard from several older adults and I think if as a state we believe in life long learning to exclude the older adults by limiting what they can do and not the others, I think would be most unfair. And it's truly an opportunity for us to demonstrate to our older Californians that we
4998	De Leon	Kevin	102	GC6hApRO4Yg	1051	1090	It didn't cross the finish line, but through a lot of hard work throughout the year we found a compromise that is fair to the good actors in the business community, the folks who lawfully employ pay their workers on a timely fashion for work performed and also for the men and women who have lost reportedly upwards of billions of dollars on an annual basis because they're either under the minimum wage or they're not paid or recognized for their over time. With that, I respectfully ask for and an aye vote.
4999	De Leon	Kevin	102	aItBzVMycEU	1616	1638	If you're BMW and you manufacture a right-to-work state like South Carolina, those standards are California standards. If you are Chrysler or Ford and you manufacture your card in Chihuahua, south of the border of Texas and Mexico, those are California standards that are actually driving the market in the United States of America.
5000	Stone	Mark	20	pX9sFyhJnT4	2183	2208	One of the things that we need to figure out in California, the dependency population and the delinquency population are really the same kids in so many ways. And this is a step. We need to work to align those systems so that we're ensuring that we have the best services for all of those kids and I appreciate your efforts in this area. Any other comments? Seeing none, Senator, you may close.
5001	Wieckowski	Bob	55	uKMBP4F7FFc	15	37	Currently the only way for consumers to stop this injustice from continuing is to file a whole new lawsuit in equity, not only can working class consumers not afford an attorney to file a lawsuit, but the money being taken from their paychecks is money they need right now to pay rent, buy groceries, and get through the week. SB 641's motion set aside is not only much faster and
5002	Wieckowski	Bob	55	P7OWm_c4uF8	1482	1492	I have a question. I know, and our 26 boards and 10 bureaus and one Commission that we have right now, we have an executive officer and we have an attorney there.
5003	Bonilla	Susan	3	llrxaJMn6L0	1019	1036	Okay so for clarification, we're not considering in this bill a process where some doctor in a back room is writing prescriptions for just all kinds of, you know, just crazy things that might or might not work.
5004	Weber	Shirley	44	qH7o9sr6oMM	281	292	Or either taking the money and giving it to a different source to do the study. That would not necessarily, that could involve UC but not make them the receivers of the dollars themselves.
5005	Block	Marty	59	mxsKkg9J8wc	647	656	Thank you Mr. Chair. If a person does not have the appropriate training, we call that an athletic trainer, they can still be called a trainer? Is that correct?
5006	De Leon	Kevin	102	jjB76hKrhNA	1682	1704	Thank you, Mr President. I think this will be our last adjournment in memory for today. And with that, it's with very deep sadness that I rise today to adjourn in the memory of one of the members of our Senate family. And that is young Kyle Long, who suddenly passed away Saturday, just two days ago,
5007	Chiu	David	7	uCE_G6_xZh8	1015	1044	I would simply also echo Senator Groves comments as well. As someone who was a former business person, I completely appreciate that when a company invests and does research and development they ought to get a fair rate of return. The question is at a time when we're seen skyrocketing drug prices, when we're talking about a potential $300 million increase in our state budget for one drug for 3,000 patients at $1,000 per pill, $85,000 per treatment, are we getting a fair price? That's really I think what we're trying to get at as well.
5008	Fuller	Jean	49	0J9n2c3eCds	1869	1890	I'm going to clarify assumption since I came in late and please feel free to join in but to the bill's proponents so, the overall assumption is that you would like to monitor your local water district's basin or a portion of the basin but that you feel that the resources required to collect data and the burden on the
5009	Bloom	Richard	2	w6A3dw8D_mc	1416	1434	Are there any limitations on the authority that you're proposing here? For example, would it be limited to areas where the groundwater basin is in chronic overdraft, or any other criteria?
5010	Obernolte	Jay	86	DaiegGG5yrM	320	335	Is because my constitutes already pay 47% more per kilowatt hour than the average in the United States, and I think that they would pay even more than that were we to pass this bill. But I thank for the answer to the question, thank you.
5011	Block	Marty	59	2afEpcU9CME	11	30	As you talk to them, I talked to several today, their hope, their optimism for the future lies in their freedom here in the United States and their feeling of security in United States, but also in the of existence of Israel, a place of safety for Jews and for people of many different backgrounds.
5012	Dahle	Brian	47	Om99VHbxcmc	1441	1476	Because right now we have, and I saw it last year, there were several bills come through here and it's basically renewable competing against renewable. I think the public doesn't understand that we have a lot of renewables available, but some are higher than others, and in different locations of the state they mean different things to different communities. I would just mention that to the board that you need to take that into consideration. Do we really get a better environmental bang for our buck if we have renewables competing against each other?
5013	Leno	Mark	60	SK-C_51Liio	527	550	And you make the point as to why this should be a local control measure. I wouldn't expect you to know all of the specifics or the dynamics of our housing crisis. Or what it means to live or represent 49 square miles. Again, an argument for local control. So we are building 10s of thousands of new units currently.
5014	Nguyen	Janet	65	BifOW5Vhe4Q	485	498	This bill has no opposition and has received support from Crimes Victims United, the Peace Office Research Associations, Police chiefs from the state of San Anna amongst other, the county of Orange.
5015	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	AHTUrQ6AUYA	680	688	And later on we may adopt it at the state level. Who knows what we may do with it we don't know at this point but I think she's asking for an assessment of, of that
5016	McGuire	Mike	93	GHyOxyKfubI	994	1017	Entire watersheds have been de-watered, all in the name of these rogue groves. Tens of thousands of acres of marijuana are located on the beautiful north coast, and the rogue growers are literally sucking rivers dry due to significantly decreased flow conditions because of the drought and illegal water diversions benefiting the vast fields of marijuana groves.
5017	Williams	Das	12	_Z7ChiMRbIg	328	361	And that is comprehensive, but it's philosophically the question of whether you believe that rate payers should pay a 100% of the cost for disposal, or whether industry should share in that responsibility, and the reason why I've authored these in the past is I believe that rate payers are paying a disproportionately large share of these disposals, because they are high-cost items, and that industry should share in that in some manner.
5018	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	m48b5iZN1Uo	25	38	I am assemblymember Reggie Jones-Sawyer. I am one of the chairs of the Assembly Select Committee on boys and men of color and I represent South Los Angeles, Walnut Park, Huntington Park, and Florence Firestone.
5019	Mitchell	Holly	64	dmdc2oNqHGQ	1117	1129	I'm gonna give everybody an opportunity to speak, but I hope that you will respect all those behind you in line, and all those who are here in the audience whose agenda items are coming up much later into the late afternoon, early evening.
5020	Weber	Shirley	44	jRDlxywi7uQ	231	241	Thank you very much. Are there any other members who'd like to have any opening comments? Okay. We do have a quorum now. Will you please call the roll?
5021	Chavez	Rocky	83	vE1aI3Q_hng	253	265	And if I can say this, so the logic was that it was more important to get the child into school, which is a constitutional right and take care of the immunization at a later time. Is that correct, did I say your logic correctly?
5022	McGuire	Mike	93	u0-ac-4sGAg	1969	1984	In November of last year, the FAA issued a mandate. to the state of California which enforce a long existing requirement that airport related revenues, aviation related field taxes must remain with the airports for aeronautical purposes.
5023	Mullin	Kevin	31	wEqNM_ksYTE	630	644	Without this option, these 600 or so developmentally disabled will be left without a consolidated health plan to maximize their Medi Cal and Medicare benefits. This is a county specific bill with no opposition.
5024	Lara	Ricardo	107	tHDAU5JmwzE	526	539	Next item is SB 722, sex offenders GPS monitoring. That's a due pass recommendation. We will substitute the role from SB 254, that bill is approved on a unanimous vote of seven to zero.
5025	Brown	Cheryl	13	FgksiwkXKF4	110	126	AB 1602 also enabled communities that were in the process of proposing incorporation or annexation to be deemed financially viable by providing a $50 per capita motor vehicle license fee allocation.
5026	McGuire	Mike	93	MOa6yahtOBc	712	727	Our local systems and oversight and care panel, is going to provide a deeper understanding in the local systems of care, and it may be in place from the perspective of county child welfare, the courts and foster care providers.
5027	Roth	Richard	106	SvIBnS8_PpY	2056	2076	If you are a district and you're engaged in litigation and it is not insured litigation, something insurance covers, or you would have to reserve against the issue. And if it were a significant matter which involve millions and millions of dollars, in many parts of California your trial court case, if it goes to trial won't get to trial for five years.
5028	Campos	Nora	76	IO307YMxf6Q	171	191	Members, this is an important bill. There are several bills out there going from one house to the other that address this issue. More than 50 years after passage of the Equal Pay Act of 1963, it is clear that the pay gap is unlikely to go away on its own.
5029	Thurmond	Tony	4	58ODc-fO4Eo	680	695	Thank you anything else from LAO's office, clearly noted. Your suggestions, I would say that it's certainly a step in the right direction and a good start. And that California's joining what 25 other states have done.
5030	Quirk	Bill	23	jKVkIx_af_k	50	68	That requires millions of dollars in investments and the companies that are going to do that scale up need to know there's a market. Right now the defense department has become a market for these fuels, and we would like the State of California to do the same.
5031	Bonta	Rob	85	hlltK4ejvk4	1367	1383	The Senate is also moving over an Assembly bill that was amended in the Senate for our concurrence.  Also a procedural move to have bills ready for any negotiated agreement. So in order to have a successful special session, we need to take this procedural step, and I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
5032	Cannella	Anthony	61	KHtTIUat0hU	2054	2067	But regardless of that, I'm concerned about ag industry, the trucking industry, and rural communities that have to drive and really, I just don't think electric vehicles are going to be sufficient for tractors or trucks.
5033	Leno	Mark	60	dAgT763r35w	595	622	If you could clarify just a little bit, Senator Wolk, how far the state can go with regard to regulations and statute regarding drones and how much of it is all preempted by federal law. So I realize this is a resolution urging the President, the Federal Aviation Agency, but what can we, can't we do on our own?
5034	Roth	Richard	106	4HKs3ChJG74	1422	1443	Thank you, Mr. Chair. I've been concerned about the surplus property disposable process anyway, both with the department of general services and certainly in the developmental center arena. We tried some language with respect to a property disposable plan, I think that was modified as well in budget subcommittee four.
5035	Hancock	Loni	98	7Ldg9YBlG9g	384	413	Yeah, well if the table was set and you can discuss where the fork and knife are going but you can't discuss if you want to set the table differently. I can see that being a matter of concern. I have a couple of quick questions just about the high deductible plan. Is there anything to stop, say a healthy young person who suddenly gets cancer from going back into a regular plan after having been on a high deductible plan for a while?
5036	Leno	Mark	60	EvXJx3b_7-s	1951	1968	Okay, this will require that the LAO work with CSU on an initial analysis to assess the potential need for new CSU campuses. It's just trailer bill language, there's no additional money in it. And there is a motion for the Assembly.
5037	Hertzberg	Robert	99	ZochdcPwJU0	1144	1170	I believe we might, do we have a PUC technical person in here, someone from PUC? No? Thought we might. Yeah I mean, look. You know this question was asked by everybody and we have a very stringent, I mean this is my point. One is for more than ten years, we've been grappling with this issue in order to create a purchase cost in difference adjustment,
5038	Leyva	Connie	62	yLYXPq0fwvY	1392	1406	Okay, the other issue I have or concern I have is the bill giving LensCrafters, basically, a safe harbor. If this has been debated for 15 years and LensCrafters hasn't changed their practice, why do we believe that they would do it in the next year or 16 months?
5039	Mullin	Kevin	31	1O51OMdLA-4	1082	1098	Thank you Mr. Low. Seeing no discussion on this item, clerk will open the roll. All members vote who desire to vote. Clerk will close the roll, tally the vote. Ayes 43, no's 21. Measure passes file Adam one-oh-one
5040	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	npLG8Ena6eQ	1316	1350	And, shouldn't we all be able to worship God in our own way? You know, I think we do ultimately worship the same God, but we worship that got in different ways. My God wants me to be able to make that decision.
5041	Gordon	Richard	117	nhED5L0HREU	1197	1221	Thank you, Madame Speaker. Again, I would point out that these rules are no different than the way we functioned in the past, and we have achieved the kind of bipartisan work referenced by my colleague under these rules, and I would again urge adoption of standing rules for 2015-2016 session by the adoption of HR 1. I ask for an aye vote.
5042	Olsen	Kristin	15	yGdC7D9fPQ8	1158	1181	Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members. I too rise in opposition to AB 92 and specifically to explain the inaccuracies in a statement that was made by one of our colleagues on the floor. It was suggested that the language that we're all expressing concern about in this bill that penalties would only apply to illegal diversions and water users. That is simply not true.
5043	Leyva	Connie	62	_JbASqkciSI	975	992	Thank you, Mr. Chair and also thank you to my co-author, Senator Pavley, on this bill. Good morning Mr. Chair and members. Yes, it's still morning. SB 398 empowers our disadvantage communities, small businesses, and small non-profits to participate in greenhouse gas reduction programs.
5044	Beall	Jim	92	CY8dWb1-gXw	1313	1356	And the second thing I wanna say is that I've always believed that R&D tax credits somehow, there is a relationship between our academic institutions and research and development. And I think we have to explore, when we talk about R&D tax credits, how we can strengthen that relationship and have our R&D tax credits benefit our academic institutions that supply so much of the research and development that drive the economy and create the economy in California. So those are my comments.
5045	Williams	Das	12	LXP_ciN3hzY	1281	1300	I'd like to ask members to join me in welcoming some guests to the back of our chambers including many who have made it through as incarcerees. We have several former incarcerees, their family members, and several Japanese-American leaders here to commemorate the day of remembrance.
5046	Beall	Jim	92	0yf1SfBcDOs	673	687	Do you want to present item two or item five first? We have a choice. Well, we're gonna begin as a Subcommittee until we reach a quorum which we're close to, we've got one more- Okay.
5047	Hertzberg	Robert	99	cvDmVx__4xs	2161	2190	So we're going to give this a shot and it sounded like despite its beautiful inspiration, it didn't result in the outcome you wanted. So forget about the fact that you're the assessor, but just from a stand, management standpoint, if somebody comes in and says, "I got 380 pages versus 16. I have hundreds of people, staff hours versus a few. Other jurisdictions is working. We tried a plan. It didn't work." Why is that something we shouldn't try? We already tried this other system. It didn't seem to work so well.
5048	Beall	Jim	92	898OiW72jWg	430	446	Okay, we have representatives for questions from the Legislative Analyst and I believe somebody from Caltrans is also here? Who's Caltrans? Yeah, come forward please. So we could talk about this which we will.
5049	Hertzberg	Robert	99	VHKwUGu3F0g	1496	1509	In Los Angeles area, the San Gabriel Valley has 157 elected officials. On these small cities, the cost of their government is 25% less, the responsiveness of police and fire is dramatically less.
5050	Mitchell	Holly	64	mqEFhmjNwxk	378	402	Further, I would argue that less staff time would need to allocated on forfeiture cases involving the federal government. As I suspect many of those cases would not stand up against California's higher evidentiary standard, and would need to be dropped as a result. So SB 443 will make better, more efficient use of law enforcement staff's time.
5051	Frazier	Jim	114	kQ8roglP29M	550	566	Thank you, Mr. Perea. I understand what you're trying to accomplish with this bill Mr. Perea, and no doubt, the San Joaquin Valley deserves better in terms of air quality. It makes sense to figure out a way to get these used electric vehicles into use because it will help us meet our clean air goals.
5052	Leno	Mark	60	SuJy5eE040k	277	293	I think the LAO's position here is that the difference between cities and counties being that counties are an adjunct of the state, cities, independent entities. Is that why we do build, use state funds for county projects?
5053	Bloom	Richard	2	mb2tyA5yp6Q	408	425	Acts of paper terrorism can range from simple and straightforward legal filings, such as frivolous lawsuits, to more complex strategies such as filing IRS forms that fraudulently allege victims have been paid large sums of money on which they declared no taxes.
5054	Beall	Jim	92	7Ldg9YBlG9g	174	198	You know, I think those kinds of things have to be done in preparation for the discussion at the bargaining. I agree with the transparency issue. I think that's good. I also think that some of the decisions made on health plans have external effects like what's the impact on worker's compensation when you have a high deductible plan?
5055	Liu	Carol	63	2ACgjV10AcU	2011	2031	Okay? All right so the bill has been moved. And I would agree with Senator Hancock that it's good for school districts to consider this in terms of a policy and have this community discussion. So with that let's call the roll. Oh with the amendments?
5056	Fuller	Jean	49	SU8_KAMcIaE	1348	1363	And so, I think, my compliments are to you on what we talked about, what some of those rewards were, particularly, cleaner burning fire places and burn policies that were helpful.
5057	McCarty	Kevin	22	ZXZJp00flVo	332	347	At least, yeah. And this is certainly something we put a lot of thought into. And it was a big priority of us to focus on re-prioritizing the University of California budget in ways that better serves California.
5058	Weber	Shirley	44	rKOC2CSv6h0	1868	1911	Okay, I think that's it. What about, all right, thank you very much. Has everyone been added on who wants to add on? Okay. Okay I want to thank the Committee, and all of these bills will be moved to the floor. Thank you very much.
5059	Leno	Mark	60	yzBzen_uFsA	47	69	Do you know if there's been any modeling as to where we would be in the percentage of our reduction, relative to 1990, if we were to reach our goal, a proposed goal of 50 percent in renewable portfolio standard, if we were to reach the goal of 50 percent drop in petroleum use and increase the 50 percent in...
5060	Burke	Autumn	6	Fpv-da0xhD8	1306	1324	was the first black player to earn a PGA membership card. Born in 1922 in Charlotte, North Carolina, he started working as a caddy at the age of 10. After serving in the army during world war two, Sifford returned to the states with a clear desire to become a pro golfer. Yet
5061	Hancock	Loni	98	A1UTGLmNv2E	2426	2449	Known for her beautiful green eyes, her radiant smile, her quick wit and great sense of humor. She will be missed very much by her family of three daughters, 16 grandchildren, and one great grandchild. Join me as we adjourn in her memory.
5062	Galgiani	Cathleen	95	-z6iX7gB4pQ	1069	1087	Are there situations where is it allowable under the law where appraisers work for a certain financing company and the financing company has an arrangement with the development company that is selling homes? Does anybody have the answer to that?
5063	Gomez	Jimmy	80	UMlpaC9VCt4	1434	1447	Great. Any other witnesses in support? Individuals from the public in support? Witnesses in opposition? Individuals from the public in opposition? Questions or comments from the committee members? Mr. Wagner.
5064	Thurmond	Tony	4	2OGvNLWw5B0	51	62	Needless to say that this development will be significant. There'll be nothing seeing this large in terms of its economic impact to the City of Richmond, probably for the next 100 years.
5065	Patterson	Jim	119	_gd0KmtJp10	931	969	Scott was a loving husband, they were married 28 years, Paulette, a wonderful supportive father of this two teenage sons Clay and Casey. They filled his life with love and joy, and he filled their lives with love and joy. At the memorial service we saw a wonderful video of Clay and Casey and Paulette and Scott in their everyday lives, and they were wonderfully talented at sports the two boys playing all kinds of baseball, football, etc., outdoors people, and the like.
5066	Fuller	Jean	49	162iDtQT3ZE	983	1003	SAFEs feel restrained by the call box priority funding requirement. The decline in use of call boxes has resulted with this technology being a less effective method, a less effective cost-effective method for SAFEs to ensure the overall reliability of the freeway system and better managed traffic flow.
5067	Grove	Shannon	77	G-cKeAHj51U	1778	1791	And so I have a real concern about the bill I know that we passed a bill last year allowing ballots to be dropped off or received three days after the election day, which is Friday, which I think solves a huge portion of this problem.
5068	De Leon	Kevin	102	SxRX-lKXiDU	1573	1602	So I think the argument can be made, you're a scientist, you have a PhD so I think you can apply a scientific assessment much better than I can or any of us can. That if you have a family who lives say in Paducah, Kentucky or Bloomington, Indiana and they go to a target store or any other store to purchase a flat screen television set,
5069	Calderon	Ian Charles	115	KWh7S198Y54	1278	1302	I don't believe that arts funding should be any different, that you need that certainty, you need that consistency in funding so that you know what kind of programs, especially if you're a school, are going to be able to offer that year, and these are such important programs that really have a profoundly positive or potentially negative impact on California's future. So again, thank you all for your time and for your comments, and I ask for an "aye" vote.
5070	Nguyen	Janet	65	rEreViIPqP0	1012	1018	Thank you for giving me this opportunity. I just wanted to -SCR 19 establishes February 28 as Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Awareness Day in conjunction with rare disease day. IBF is a rare condition that causes progressive and curable lung disease.
5071	Wolk	Lois	94	h1jaLifdzdM	1252	1285	There might be less business for the Board of Corrections, prisons that you served on. So I think it's important that clinics provide very important services, not necessarily better than what the ideal that we all like to see, but they're important services and they may be the only services that young women in need of health services can't access and they need to be able to do that.
5072	Beall	Jim	92	RToDyZa8pHM	1628	1646	How many contractor loss, you know, prosecutions had there been on unethical behavior among contractors? There has been some in California. I think the committee ought to be aware of those. When we review this kind of bills, there's nothing in the report here, it should be--
5073	Pavley	Fran	104	45ZR2HT6sPs	146	163	They're either contaminated and they're taking out so much water than they're putting in. They're under severe distress. So out of the 515 basins, I think it's about 125 or so, falls into that row. So, that is a separate bill, but it is related to this.
5074	Mitchell	Holly	64	zKRXexcG8LM	1687	1711	It increases transparency. Current law requires the Attorney General to issue a yearly report which this bill builds upon to include the number of cases initiated under state law versus those involving the feds, the number of suspects charged with crimes, the disposition of the cases, i.e. if no charges were filed, if the charges were dropped, a plea deal, acquittal, etc.
5075	Pavley	Fran	104	nrJtkVtsuec	1070	1087	So if auction revenue ended in two years and you have a five-year plan, you can make up the difference? I just wanna make sure there wasn't some consequences of other areas of the general fund, or state had to backfill.
5076	Gordon	Richard	117	1WV4YJ98mc4	1598	1621	My suggestion would be that we encourage the conference committee to look at this item and that we perhaps, because the conference committee is gonna be reviewing all of the cap and trade at some point, so maybe there's a way to encourage that.
5077	Beall	Jim	92	GcYm7_0fTAo	1815	1858	So when I saw this bill, I thought well, it's kind of a different kind of thing, but I think if we want to look at trying to find funds for our state parks, this might be one way we can get some extra money for our state parks. if it does that it's a good thing. So although it's kinda a different way of doing things, I recommend that we go along with it. Just for that reason. Because of what we went through in the past. So we have a motion on this bill. Do we have any other comments? Okay, do we have any close? Would you gentlemen like to close?
5078	Lara	Ricardo	107	CfbKdUW5Buw	1366	1385	Senator de Leon's SB 654 works in concert with my bill to reform the DTSC's permitting program. This bill aims at ending an ongoing continued of expired permits that has created a backlog that we must, that you just heard DTSC talk about.
5079	Low	Evan	11	uuwAxYppIw8	2367	2377	Obviously a lot of effort has gone into this and I am prepared with the amendments, and thank you Mr. Chair and thank you to the author, to vote in support of this here today.
5080	Monning	Bill	25	JgW1-pNw53E	365	409	Of family that doesn't have childcare here today, it doesn't help them if we figured it out 2 or 3 years from now. The need is urgent, so I know meeting with constituents and casterville sitting around that table, there was a kleenex box in the middle, as mothers shared their stories of leaving minimum wage jobs when we cut childcare support because they had to make the choice then between the minimum wage job and providing care for their children. So, for those children, for those families, the urgency is now. Waiting lists don't help somebody fulfilled job requirements.
5081	Holden	Chris	78	ITEaoTWbk6c	195	211	Assembly Bill 1100 Low from the Public Safety Committee to the Rules Committee. Assembly Bill 1230 Gomez from the local government Committee to Rules Committee, and Assembly Bill 1247 Irwin from the agriculture Committee to the Rules Committee.
5082	Nielsen	Jim	68	rD0VjcELenc	2150	2168	They traveled together to medical conferences around the world, around the country. He was very active in his profession. They toured Germany, Poland, and Russia. She shared these experiences when they got back, going to elementary schools
5083	Lara	Ricardo	107	qvwEtfRitEI	1766	1787	Yeah, some guns do include small bits of ivory. Since AB 96 clearly exempts bona-fide antiques comprised of less than 5% of ivory, guns that meet the criteria are exempted under this bill. Additionally, to sell any ivory, you already must have documentation. That is part of the federal law.
5084	Lara	Ricardo	107	qvwEtfRitEI	1754	1766	Yes, thank you Madame Vice Chair. This is a candidate for suspense and we look forward to continuing to work on this measure while it's in suspense. I know we had a lengthy policy discussion, but I wanted to make a couple of clarifications.
5085	Anderson	Joel	57	bcyIxM2tSYs	1306	1330	Well, if they're blind, they may not know where to check that box, that's the concern I have. You're gonna learn that this is the one committee where I have no reluctance in spending taxpayers' money, because I believe that people have died for the right to vote, and that we should do everything we can to protect it.
5086	Weber	Shirley	44	9dAQc3y-2jQ	1976	1993	And so we're looking at whether or not we wanted to include in trailer bill language the opportunity for districts if they choose to, to basically sponsor and offer older American courses. Oftentimes they're health related courses or those kinds of things.
5087	Hernandez	Ed	103	_fj8pVeO8ic	1237	1244	At this point I'm not prepared to, I would like to move forward with the Kaiser Small Group and for me, I think it still comes down to overall cost.
5088	Rendon	Anthony	120	OGSzGIXfLs8	520	536	If so, then the title and summary would include notice to petition signers of that determination. We need to make sure that voters have enough information as to constitutionality when they sign the petition, and that's what this bill does. I ask for your aye vote.
5089	Rendon	Anthony	120	OGSzGIXfLs8	505	520	AB 884 would give voters that information at the front end when they are considering whether to sign the petition for an unconstitutional measure. It would allow, not require, the Attorney General to determine if a proposed initiative would violate a person's constitutional rights.
5090	Thurmond	Tony	4	8bOmzPkZfE0	1926	1936	All students are our students and they deserve the best that we can provide for them and our school districts should recognize that about charter schools the same way they do about traditional public schools.
5091	Chiu	David	7	wK5CwGDTeOM	933	948	The clerk will open the roll. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. The clerk will close the roll and tally the votes. Aye's - 60, no's - 0, the measure passes.
5092	Thurmond	Tony	4	eSyz0S9hgyk	1080	1090	what is the benchmark that... Aside from removing the stigma, which I really appreciate. That's very, very critical. What is the benchmark by which we are measuring our success with these efforts?
5093	Monning	Bill	25	81AHHgExKGE	1498	1512	For a family who's child's health is at risk, maybe their life is at risk, they don't wanna be told that the ALJ has good legal training and can interpret to medical professionals, if that's called for.
5094	Bonta	Rob	85	4IkAjWExsPI	941	953	So you have your next bill, excuse me. File item number 27 AB 1518. Aging and long term care bill that you're presenting as the chair. Please proceed when you're ready.
5095	Pan	Richard	96	VyoFcVtTJtQ	209	217	But, you know, I think that I don't feel comfortable being able to say just I'm just going to carve out an exception for something that's not specifically defined.
5096	Burke	Autumn	6	vyfz8Yq8ZGw	1590	1599	But my question is what is the fee on the decal, and is it a one-time fee, is it an annual fee, and is it a monthly fee? Those are my two questions. Thank you.
5097	Gallagher	James	108	goLRzsDXvfE	100	117	We've already passed a bill that is going to help expand access to pre-K education and we need to go forward and find those creative ways to move forward on this, not to do something that really does nothing to move the issue forward. Thank you, members
5098	Ting	Philip	30	qCEr8jDp5Hg	893	908	I, I think given your excellent example, Mr., Capaul, the millionaire in Bel Air who could have a 1975 basis may only be paying a few thousand dollars in property taxes, so could potentially get a large, large tax breaks through there as well.
5099	Monning	Bill	25	71FNaoH1Uwg	1185	1217	And we need to protect and preserve this space for free speech that is peaceful and yet exercise as an opening that some may not be comfortable with, but is within the province of that exercise of free speech. So again, I know your history, I know your commitment to protecting people against the variant forms of anti-Semitism and racism and any of its manifestations and I too look forward to working with you.
5100	Stone	Jeff	26	J_Iq4rTF6rc	1237	1251	Right. Well, that's, that's making the assumption that, we don't have people that are willing to put in that time. On a, on a pro bono basis just for the honor of serving on these commissions to give of their professional expertise.
5101	Nielsen	Jim	68	U931SFow8w0	951	967	And so we're going to turn something over to them but, okay, this is what Caltrans requires, you have to do it. Well, what about asking local government how they want it to be done and let that guide, rather than what Caltrans says; is that a part of the deal?
5102	Stone	Jeff	26	XCFU_0j8dAo	1082	1105	So, I appreciate the concerns of the committee. I try to not bring bills that don't have any common sense associated with them. I think that this is good for the environment. It's good for the habitat. It's good for the local government that's going to get the electricity at a lower rate.
5103	Pavley	Fran	104	iupDRc3kcPY	922	937	 Thank you for saying that, Senator Wolk. I was especially interested in the LAO's recommendation on page nine. This needs to be built in all the time, whether it's cap and trade money or proposition one monies.
5104	Brown	Cheryl	13	kJUQLNRw8o8	1699	1717	This, this is available to disabled veteran business enterprises and is through an informal bidding process. I have a witness who will speak on it, Mr. Brigg Goodwin from Granite Data Solutions, Solutions.
5105	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	JwS_raJ5ApY	1215	1233	Would you go back-- I'm sorry, we're going to give you a little more time here, I'm hav-- maybe it's me, but the first point was that the constitution allows substantial leeway and that according to your understanding we don't even have to give a medical exemption is that correct?
5106	Wagner	Donald	88	7KrRcZ9ORsY	1872	1891	And that would be to strike the word abortion where it appears in this bill. Then it probably sails out of here, all of these people thank you and they go back about their daily lives. I guess I'll just ask, would you be willing to take that friendly amendment?
5107	McGuire	Mike	93	GIcgVGMKBjg	1871	1899	They're extremely violent, they're well-funded, and sophisticated, and frankly, there are 300 approximate rangers that, and wardens, that Fish and Wildlife has on the ground in this state right now. And according to Director Chuck Bonham, you could put every Ranger on trespass marijuana grows tomorrow and still be out manned and outgunned and out-funded. I ask for your support for AB 92.
5108	Brown	Cheryl	13	AXzsxnBFv8M	2032	2056	Thank you Mr. Brownstone. This has been quite a day. The information has been rich. I really appreciate everyone coming out and being a part of it,  especially my colleagues who have, as you see all of their names up here, have been able to come in and be a part of this hearing.
5109	Mitchell	Holly	64	A1UTGLmNv2E	979	995	Mr. Robbins and several other actors gang members, Sober Williams who's joining today, regularly conduct theater workshops was incarcerating men and women in an effort to unlock their human potential and to fill the gap in arts rehabilitation programs in our own California prison system. The prison project and you all have brochures of the prison project with amazing quotes of men and women who participated in the program who are residents, shall we say, of CDCR.
5110	Leno	Mark	60	8YNqtXYvNaM	2186	2201	And I'm suggesting that I will support Senator Lara's motion for the $2 million out of general fund for the purpose of the nonprofit security grant program when we return to the $40 million, should we collectively agree to support that.
5111	Hancock	Loni	98	6e0LFFmZAnE	1072	1095	It's modeled on the authority that many other water districts, cities, counties, municipal utility districts, already have, and has worked very well for the five years in which it's been in effect. EBMUD has stopped terminating service to master metered multi-family residential buildings.
5112	Perea	Henry	33	xJqN87zbSDI	2269	2292	At the same time, I wanna make sure that we preserve and enhance economic opportunities for them as well and I think that there's an opportunity here for us to have a win-win in both addressing issues like GHG reduction, but also doing it in a way that allows for job growth. That allows for all regions within our respective districts to prosper.
5113	Bloom	Richard	2	z_nb3rZYxjo	611	632	And there seems to be little or no attention being paid to it as a potential low-cost technology that could be broadly implemented. Maybe there would have been Trailer Bill Language that could have helped move that along. Are there any other questions?
5114	Eggman	Susan Talamantes	73	_b18tzFsHIo	1386	1401	We have seen an uptake in the epidemic of HIV/AIDS and it's happening in rural areas, young people, young people of color, so we need to do our best to take precautions to provide education so that people can make decisions that keep themselves safe. I urge a strong aye vote on AB 329.
5115	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	EupEjx01Yv8	918	938	Thank you. Let me just start by saying this effort started a few months ago and brought a lot of people to the table and so this is a maybe still a work in progress but also represents a lot of work, a lot of opinion by a lot of people so I appreciate the committee staffs work on this as well.
5116	Perea	Henry	33	FA0o_dng1YE	1364	1377	So we've provide protections on the front end, we want to make sure we limit the way these individuals are contacted and even in the end. If they're still not sure about the decision they made, they have 72 hours to resend that decision.
5117	Beall	Jim	92	1tbz59-ST4g	1118	1140	I'm not making, I'll say right now, I'm not interested in a vehicle license fee. I'm not. I think that's why I just said to Senator Huff, the proposal we have now is not including vehicle license fee. Not interested. If somebody else wants to propose it, we'll have another bill, but it won't be by Jim Beall. So, Senator Hertzberg, you have some comments.
5118	McGuire	Mike	93	EhsW00cBA0A	683	698	This bill would not supersede provisions of Measure D as approved by the voters of the City of Los Angeles or any other measures that have been passed locally. Licences would only be valid if both, the state and the local jurisdiction, approve the applications.
5119	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	AHTUrQ6AUYA	1669	1684	Item number four, AB 288, do pass to apros, appropriations. Item number five, AB 306, do pass as amended to appropriations. Item number 10, AB 625, do pass as amended to appropriations.
5120	Ting	Philip	30	E5jWkjQTDB0	1649	1669	One quick question, I know we're running long. I was curious for each of the districts, as you went through your LCAP process was there any one thing that you all came out of with something different that you wouldn't have done without that process?
5121	Gordon	Richard	117	mgO95LX_sqE	1457	1480	That you put up a break water somewhere, it effects the next door neighbors. So as we think about adaptation, we do need to think also regionally, and encourage regional thinking and regional coordination as these cities planned. But I am pleased to support the bill and as said, I moved it.
5122	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	EtJ6XaeStes	2008	2016	And so I, I commend you for putting this bill forward because I think it not only takes care of the, the new young people that are coming in and people out there.
5123	Garcia	Eduardo	38	h4u4YccC9Z8	438	462	The original thought of not having a three year expiring date was to really give the local water agencies, the ability to do some thorough analysis and planning, but you I think if it was safe to say that I probably will be back before you three years from now, unfortunately.
5124	Gomez	Jimmy	80	QXW5aikdMmE	812	841	AB 490, Alejo, preparation for community college EOPS programs. Hold in committee. AB 491, Gonzalez, English learners proficiency assessment reclassification, due pass. A roll call. AB 496, Rendon, pupil nutrition funding for fresh drinking water, due pass with amendments to clarify reliable use of funding. A roll call. AB 524, Low, service learning high school graduation requirement holding committee.
5125	Roth	Richard	106	BhpjNxoKRfU	468	478	I look forward to continuing to work with stakeholders in the healthcare field as well as the administration with respect to this very, very important issue and I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
5126	Lara	Ricardo	107	-Ah0Dbgfor4	589	608	With that, we move SB 4 HealthCare Coverage, Immigration Status with two pass amendments to limit automatic eligibility to children, and to allow enrollment by adults based on funding provided in the budget. We will substitute the roll call from SB 454.
5127	Grove	Shannon	77	kmplgTQ8GXM	1155	1169	It's actually favoring the UFW and with all the court cases like I said and the court cases and everything that's coming down and the media that's going on especially with the ALRB and and the UFW and all the conflicts that are arising through that organisation.
5128	Pavley	Fran	104	CoCqxpnnd8w	1990	2018	This is not the vehicle for gutting and amending, because this bill as it is too, just some minor technical changes. And not that they don't need to be made, but I don't want to allow a vehicle to be used for other purposes. And I'm taking you at your word so amendments. This is not the vehicle for some other grand schemes out there.
5129	Weber	Shirley	44	kIKVbsrTmqg	1039	1053	We knew we didn't have the money, but we asked our folks to go back and look at a plan. And Sub 1 and as a result we kind of have a plan of how we're going to roll it out and slowly, but surely add to it each year so that we get to the point where we're doing annual evaluation in a couple years.
5130	Huff	Bob	105	pjSDFWGC8xY	77	97	It seems kinda like common sense, that doesn't always prevail here. So that's what led to the construction of SCAX1, and absent any specific questions, I think I'll just leave it at that. The main component of this is protecting the truck weight fees currently diverted to the general fund to pay for
5131	Olsen	Kristin	15	UDPqIWouyOQ	1256	1270	But unfortunately, we in California rank in the bottom 10% of every state in the United States for student achievement and educational excellence. I think and I hope we all agree that that is unacceptable and we have to do something about it.
5132	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	Wt_ez7F9UlE	1644	1661	Thank you. And I would also like to add, I hope that we have more opportunities to use the electronic resources available to make sure that people do have their opportunity, even if they are distances away or their circumstances don't allow it, to be able to access the court.
5133	Kim	Young	82	Hi5Vq6PdNIY	580	597	Because it's my understanding, reading on page twelve in our agenda, the state pension reform ties potential salary to social security wage base which is capped at a hundred eighteen thousand five hundred-dollars.
5134	Leno	Mark	60	GBt-hlKdDjQ	254	278	Thank you for pointing out the 2% and I think the math here is that in round numbers we're investing approximately $8 billion in community colleges in the difference is in the neighborhood of around a half. See, 10% would be 400 million. 5%, well, in community colleges a little higher than 2%, but overall two.
5135	Beall	Jim	92	JB8xflm0bpc	913	926	It's you got different, you might have one way of financing it, you might have multiple ways of financing. It can get real complicated, in other words. So, that's the issue.
5136	Wood	Jim	72	WE6m9wVcbNQ	518	523	So, I'm curious, would you object to that, because if your assertion is that the definitions that bother you, I wonder, I'd love to hear what you have to say about that.
5137	Pan	Richard	96	u9WQRBoV7yg	632	651	So a sunshine week is a celebration of the public's commitment to openness and what open government means in a technology-enhanced future. ACR 41 increases public awareness that people have the right to access and see what the government does and how it works. I respectfully ask for any aye vote. Thank you.
5138	Calderon	Ian Charles	115	Gnpfbx52n0w	24	33	I believe these amendments reflect the true intent of the bill and are consistent with protecting the wishes of individuals after they pass away. So I will be accepting them.
5139	Ting	Philip	30	5fJ7Ysn9i88	1491	1508	I'm not sure what result we would get by doing this, so it is very concerning for me. But also having said that, I think is core that we continue to find ways to deliver adult education better.
5140	Hall	Isadore	1	zxPLA2x-8Hc	1157	1166	No, we're just gonna do a hearing for that occasion and we'll bring it to the forefloor for consideration. Yeah, very good. Thank you Mr. Vice Chair, Mr. Gaines, Senator Gaines.
5141	Nielsen	Jim	68	WfZQBhRsFGQ	56	80	Today we're going to be able to focus on that. Let me introduce some of the folks that make all this possible for us. Wade Teasdale is our principal consultant to this Committee on my right. On my immediate left, Cindy Baldwin, she's our assistant.
5142	Nielsen	Jim	68	XpKblvis-ZU	1415	1435	Director Pimlott, the fuel reduction, how are we doing on that, you know, phasing in the fee money and actually making progress getting that fuel reduced. I know I see folks in here today, I've have been meeting with them in the office whenever I could. I know they're helping you on that.
5143	Bonilla	Susan	3	ik8_Xx3XS1w	97	111	So if you can imagine, you're at the bottom of the pay scale, you're making barely enough to live on, in fact it's not enough to live on, honestly. And now you're going to have to pay 2 to $4000 for your mandated training as a brand new teacher.
5144	Grove	Shannon	77	P6cBeme--dw	1872	1891	Would he probably want another life? Probably. But pain is a part of life and this bill I submit to you is germane to this special extraordinary session because I think that people are looking for cost-cutting measures in the Medi-Cal program and this is not a way to deal with cost-cutting measures. I ask you for a no vote.
5145	Chau	Ed	116	v8Lqd5JpuF0	1809	1829	And according to the most recent study conducted by the California Health Benefit Review Program in connection with this bill their conclusion was the existing APs are currently serving only 40% of the need. Now in order to meet the serve the remaining 60% Two hundred more providers are needed in fact.
5146	Wood	Jim	72	X-EMNVy0KVE	389	401	AB 623. More than 60 people die every day in the United States from prescription drug overdoses. Approximately 6.5 million people in the US abused prescription drugs in 2013.
5147	Hernandez	Ed	103	tMpsiN_Q_5M	1244	1261	Thank you very much. And it did go over just lightly over the half hour, we will be fair and give the opponents the same amount of time. So, if you don't mind, I'd appreciate if those of you who are giving testimony, if you could move on down and we'll bring up the opposition at this time. And we will not start the clock until everyone is seated.
5148	Stone	Mark	20	cyEYl7uOG5U	507	531	Thank you. Any other witnesses in support? Seeing none, any witnesses in opposition? Ok and just for clarification, you've all have been handed out the details that we worked on last night between the committee and the author so if anybody has questions
5149	Block	Marty	59	4INVuEQu1gA	367	393	I know we are talking just about the fiscal aspects here so let me move quickly to that, there has never been a medical malpractice claim against a naturopathic doctor filed in California. Naturopathic doctors already perform to the scope we're asking for, safely in 13 other states and the only cost they found in these other states, the only cost of this additional scope of practice is for minor enforcement of the naturopathic medical committee, which is very minimal, as I said.
5150	Weber	Shirley	44	ELlYlrBZUfQ	972	995	Nielson wants to spend $1.5 billion on a prison that we don't need. I'm a write this down. But anyway, but no I think our position is we need to really develop it in some way whether it's tradable language or whatever, a much more aggressive plan to basically work to close this down in a manner that's sensitive to obviously the prison population and the staffing that's there.
5151	Thurmond	Tony	4	oRmeSyrF0cc	91	107	The National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health has said that smokeless tobacco does in fact cause oral cancer, esophageal cancer, pancreatic cancer and other conditions such as gum disease.
5152	Pavley	Fran	104	cRT-vVNBfAE	805	828	There's really no consequences on not meeting the deadline, what this part of the budget does, yes, adds some additional PYs for DOGGR, and I think eight for the State Water Board to hopefully be able to handle this really significant problem.
5153	Hernandez	Ed	103	UvkHUCZkG9I	1121	1142	That currently is 5 and enough to get out, were going to put the bill on call, we have some absent members, we do have to be in session, we will recess. For those of you in the audience who need to be up for the next 2 bills I would encourage all of my colleagues to come back and not go home after session.
5154	Patterson	Jim	119	5jUUOwMdhxk	66	87	I appreciate that. And I've owned and operated radio stations for 30 years. We're 365 days a year. We do not choose; it is a function of our license. It is a definition of our community service, number one.
5155	Bonta	Rob	85	NviFkqt51yI	412	426	And today, on the issue that was raised about the term exclusive, the exclusive right and power to regulate and license persons for the cultivation, manufacture, transportation, sale and other related activities regarding medical cannabis in the state, we are changing that today.
5156	Thurmond	Tony	4	HBOX_ihiZFg	632	646	So you know from my perspective, I don't wanna go back other than to say, you're right, it's been too long to get to this point. But we do have an opportunity. We do have an opportunity for hope. We do have an opportunity to move swiftly.
5157	Rodriguez	Freddie	69	2IKoCnJyE-g	559	569	Okay. And, then, well, just coming from my experience on there, I think by the time you arrive there, even though you haven't en entered the facility, because I'll tell you what.
5158	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	Wt_ez7F9UlE	26	51	Additionally, we have eight items that are on the consent calendar. They are items 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13 and 15. Again 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13 and 15.  We need to establish quorum.
5159	Hernandez	Ed	103	218-RTK66_I	1081	1106	By targeting this population, this bill seeks to stop our youth from experimenting with the addictive and deadly drug. If the potential to save lives is not reason enough, there are also significant potential for cost savings by increasing the age. It is no secret that tobacco use is associated with poor health, and as outlined in the Committee analysis, there is potential for significant savings in the long term.
5160	Brown	Cheryl	13	3I7f3vKVAeA	1687	1702	Well-intentioned people worked on this bill, and now we've come to a point of where things that people have spoken about tonight on the floor, they're not in there anymore, it's not there anymore.
5161	Hernandez	Ed	103	218-RTK66_I	1030	1039	Yeah, thank you Mr. Chair and members. If you don't mind, I'm gonna be presenting my bill. Senator Liu is absent, so if you don't mind, I'd like to present her bill SBX8F.
5162	Stone	Jeff	26	Tb_ZR86SMpk	937	952	This applies to over-the-counter pesticides that are over-the-counter for a reason because they're not they don't create a danger for the applicator, the people living in homes for the applications are being made if they follow the directions on the bottles.
5163	Leno	Mark	60	Q3p12T-SoaE	103	121	To have any idea, and I also have a list of the Top 10 by population states in the country, and we're only about 70% of those eligible accessing their EITC.
5164	Beall	Jim	92	OS2EK8G551s	71	100	AB 3632 which was in place since the 1980s mandated county mental health agencies to provide mental health services to students, but we changed that in 2011 with the Budget Act in AB 114, which is a budget bill, eliminated this mandate and shifted the responsibilities to school districts to provide mental health service.
5165	Wilk	Scott	19	_wQgbHlbFh8	1421	1429	So, this is something we definitely need to address, and I just appreciate your leadership on that. And, should I go ahead and finish it off Mr. Chair? So-
5166	Block	Marty	59	qOa-rMs90gw	1259	1273	No, this just on this item. Okay, with, seeing no further members of the public who wish to address the committee on this item, please read the motion and call the roll.
5167	Gomez	Jimmy	80	24W2oeMkjbI	1507	1520	So, I wanna make sure that you understand that I think the opposition is real and it's something that you should take serious consideration when moving the bill forward and hopefully amending as you move forward.
5168	Kim	Young	82	ullCtaxzBRw	759	779	There are many programs that Go-Biz is implementing and I commend you in all of those areas because it's such a short period of time as you said I'm really encouraged to hear about the success and I know we have some way to go to make it into a full successful program.
5169	Pan	Richard	96	m_1fhqTgwb8	1485	1501	Thank you so much for your presentations, both of you. You know, I represent a district which has both districts that are expanding and we're looking at new construction, and actually districts that are shrinking in enrollment and closing schools and trying to figure out how to re-purpose schools.
5170	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	mNyHP9HDpqk	1807	1816	I would encourage you to do the same. He's a more than capable leader on all these topics and there's a reason why he brought it forward cuz he actually cares.
5171	Chavez	Rocky	83	MO4QFekCxFk	1155	1171	But I'm going to look at and use the example of the Mexico study, cuz I read it also. But that's just a recent study. It'd be interesting to see, down the line, the years, to see how it's continuing to do if it, it's dropped out or it's gonna go back up again.
5172	Bonilla	Susan	3	TvQ9C3wWm5M	1196	1213	Okay just wanted that on. On the record. Just so the committee knows, the physicians did ask for more amendments. One regarded the business practices, the models that were referred to as the AOC and the IPA.
5173	McGuire	Mike	93	nqU0Ufhmqoo	1447	1466	While still shy, the state's historical investment in CTE, Senate Bill 148 would appropriate $600 million, an additional $350 million, over the proposal of the governor to a new metrics driven CTE incentive grant program. Here's why this is critical. This year, we're currently at crossroads and CTE is on the edge of a fiscal cliff.
5174	McGuire	Mike	93	GHyOxyKfubI	1465	1482	There may be some here today that you may hear from that don't agree with the issue of medical marijuana, and I understand that. But the fact is this. The medical marijuana industry is legal in California due to the Compassionate Use Act, Prop 215, passed by California voters.
5175	Bonilla	Susan	3	VFoe5hvDs-o	90	107	AB 599 updates statute to allow cytotechnologists to perform tests with new technologies which are within their training, hopefully causing more cytotechnologists to stay in the state, less labs to ship our specimens out of state, and also creating high skilled jobs.
5176	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	gjsHvnVIeLU	97	114	We can't allow any doubt about whether it's okay to warehouse our kids in fake classes instead of offering them a real education. Here today to testify in support is David Sapp from the ACLU, and Edwin Perez from the NAACP. Thank you and I ask for your aye vote on AB 1012
5177	Weber	Shirley	44	uuwAxYppIw8	928	949	I think everyone wants to resolve this issue. We want to find a reasonable way to do it. We want to restore confidence in our police officers in terms of how people handle it. I was telling someone the other day that I, I was a part of starting the first battered women services center in San Diego, and the interesting thing I noticed in the data as I looked at those who came into that center and that shelter.
5178	Maienschein	Brian	84	UqQcd0TyhPE	998	1022	So all of these things and admittedly, all of these things are going to be individual to what type of disaster hits what region, but what I can tell you with personal certainty, because I had to deal with it twice and I really did pay attention to this issue because it was important me personally, it was extremely difficult amongst the thousands of issues we were dealing with at that time, this one was difficult.
5179	Holden	Chris	78	nhED5L0HREU	1489	1506	Madame Speaker and members, House Resolution 3 is a routine housekeeping resolution which does the following: authorizes the Chief Clerk and Sergeant-at-Arms to receive warrants from the controller to paid members, very important, officers, and staff of the Assembly.
5180	Mendoza	Tony	52	OQ--SYddrUc	161	185	One quick excerpt from the state auditors office that I was able to look at said that the EDD's eligibility determinations are frequently overturned at the first-level of appeal at a rate of about 50%. It seems like a high turnover rate.  Have you put something afoot to try and decrease that?
5181	Leno	Mark	60	IKy1yzt0SRs	98	121	Okay, and then are we including in the estimates for the additional tax revenue the state will experience, as a result of including e-cigarettes for the first time in the tax. How much more money is that going to bring us and how does that impact the need to back fill these programs that you say are going to have to be compensated for loss of revenue, as a result of the increase?
5182	Mitchell	Holly	64	4jcXQWLspO4	961	975	I was just trying to get a sense when you talked about over a million syringes brought in. I'm trying to get a sense of what statewide, getting back to Senator Stone's earlier question, whether or not the state had administered a syringe exchange program.
5183	Chiu	David	7	Ew5hLn0iC0U	1113	1129	As well as by requiring licensed facilities to provide a simple four-line notice that free or low-cost public programs are available for comprehensive family planning services, prenatal care and abortion services with a phone number to the local county social service office.
5184	Nielsen	Jim	68	IUqqKj1b5UE	1497	1510	Mr. Chairman, let me just add, and I would follow on Senator Pan's observation that I think it's not settled here yet. I think the author's made a very good faith effort, but I think that there is still more work to be done.
5185	Monning	Bill	25	H9-I5joylQw	1307	1323	And nobody said it's gonna be easy, we're willing to work with the contingencies of concern, to address those, but our number one interest is the protection of foster youth, many of whom are being prescribed drugs.
5186	Quirk	Bill	23	VsFc4cEmvwc	486	521	All right, thank you. We'll bring up the next panel and I think they'll be able to talk about the approach to solving this issue as well. So I think you've already heard what everyone's concerned about, so when you make your presentations, please particularly address that issue.
5187	Lara	Ricardo	107	-Ah0Dbgfor4	1130	1150	SB 398, Green Assistance Program. Do pass as amended to delete assistance during application writing process. We will substitute the role from SB 254. That bill was 454. There's so many fours. The bill is approved on five to two vote, with Republicans voting no.
5188	Calderon	Ian Charles	115	22ufHgqGK-A	1612	1625	On their various online accounts after they pass away. In fact a recent poll found that 70% of Americans say that they're online communications and photo should remain private after they die unless they get prior consent for others to have access.
5189	Stone	Jeff	26	8mKwfh1zVig	1950	1964	Now of course, I didn't like it as an independent pharmacist because I lost my, my market share. But the insurance company found that I think was, Save-On drug at the time, that was the beneficiary, and lowered the fees that usually pharmacists were getting at the time by about 50%.
5190	Roth	Richard	106	5WD5y8t5m5U	324	338	Sure. And as she's approaching, this leads me to the my next question, my follow up question, which is, why are we not waiting until the criminal process either takes its course or fails to start?
5191	Chiu	David	7	PPBgSxp7D00	1111	1132	We are not only creating tremendous congestion on our streets but public safety issues when you have cars in the middle of the intersection creating gridlock that cyclists and pedestrians are trying to get around. Now, with all due respect to the triple A, there were some erroneous statements in their letter.
5192	Pavley	Fran	104	FapiTOGMI3c	1348	1368	And that relates to percolation ponds and how we phase them out and the toxicity of combinations of chemicals. Mostly a disclosure bill. And a phasing out, if needed of some of the percolation pawns. We have 900, other states don't have them at all, this is only about protecting ground water.
5193	Stone	Mark	20	1O51OMdLA-4	1336	1364	This bill has been tried before, I ran this last year, it was held in appropriations without a good funding source. Thanks to my co-author Madam Speaker, or joint author Madam Speaker and the the Assembly budget staff, we've identified some funds in Prop 40 that would allow us to put some public money on the table be able to garner some private money as well to fully fund this program and get our kids out into our environments It's a great program. It's a good opportunity for our communities and I respectfully request your Aye votes.
5194	Hueso	Ben	48	MJvFThfrsHs	821	850	This is a follow up to SB 43 which is currently actually, has gone through the proceedings with the PUC. 793 requires that the PUC will allow customers in a utility's green tariff and shared renewable program to enter into long term program subscriptions and receive a reasonably estimated bill credit and bill charge for a period of up to 20 years.
5195	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	VyoFcVtTJtQ	967	980	This is for behavior while they're students at our community colleges or behavior doing the period of time that they are students and are thus deemed to present a threat to the campus environment.
5196	Thurmond	Tony	4	hecrzVTBfRM	854	869	Just one for you Mr. Lightbourne if you would just say it again,  the number of consumers using IHSS in California,  in what, if that number represents growth or decrease from previous years.
5197	Wieckowski	Bob	55	EaHeR5UFXjc	1879	1897	Please let me have my day in court. So, in banking committee, this characterization of, oh, we don't have this information, remember, Assemblymember Gallagher, the court holds the record. You do not get your judgment unless you filed with the court your proof.
5198	Williams	Das	12	-Y7u0vZ_OFQ	969	989	So it's almost more oversight of them not squirreling away enough money for it, maybe, instead of doing too much, because the question is when will there be set aside enough to actually purchase a craft that has enhanced capability.
5199	Hernandez	Ed	103	7vLzhqaEeV8	772	789	Whether it's transparency in provider rates but also now transparency on drug prices, facilities, and now I'm a little concerned about some of the binding arbitration and issues that you mentioned with regard to the closed arbitration and the anti-trust.
5200	Hernandez	Ed	103	7vLzhqaEeV8	379	390	Thank you. Any other comments or questions from any of the other members? I have a couple questions. The first one would be directed to Ms. Cantwell from DHCS.
5201	Leyva	Connie	62	1JV-wI6cFUY	36	57	I have not spoke with one person who says they enjoy sleeping on the street or in a park. I think we need to do more in the way of jobs. Most of the people that I know who are currently homeless are homeless because we had a great downturn in the economy as many of you may remember a few years ago and that put a lot of people out on the streets.
5202	Hueso	Ben	48	GHyOxyKfubI	362	385	And of course we also exempt certain licensed hospital facilities that already have medical care. And we went through a kinda list of buildings that do not qualify, those under construction, those are vacant or under renovation, and this would be on all new construction, so any new construction of high-occupancy buildings and of state buildings as well.
5203	Hernandez	Roger	37	_x7-b1Y1JBM	434	456	We are not. This bill in its original proposal had a governance element in it, and that was removed. And through the assembly appropriations process this bill has been whittled down to one very simple prohibition. And that prohibition is that a for profit entity can not run or operate a charter school.
5204	Mitchell	Holly	64	Q3p12T-SoaE	948	983	It is not trivial. It is not. Nor, is it simple. Nor do I think it's easy to discuss in a policy context. Anyway, Doctor Thompson, every time you come, I learn something new and you take my breath away, literally, with the stunning reality of decisions we're making in a public policy environment, and the impact it has on the very core human development of the human being.
5205	Huff	Bob	105	2Yu9E6dAMwM	1673	1682	For years, I've been up here 11 years and I've heard it's all about money, well Local Control Funding Formula is getting more money. With our budget coming back prop 98 is making sure we're getting a lot of money to the schools.
5206	Pan	Richard	96	S3armm26vew	972	987	Today, all counties offer the applicant the choice of an in-person face-to-face interview or telephone interview. Some counties have even adapted telephonic signature to make the process more efficient. This bill would give the county the option to do telephone interviews just like they do for CalFresh.
5207	Lackey	Tom	10	KZTa69-ElFQ	1391	1409	And I was wondering, specifically, is this the kind of money that this is targeted for? Because $2 million is a significant amount of money, obviously, and I'm just kind of inquiring as to the benefit that would result from this allocation.
5208	Thurmond	Tony	4	kk6g3FKMEtk	767	776	I'll tell you honestly, I don't ever want to do anything that's going to make it harder for young people to get information and that's why I don't think I can support this bill.
5209	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	hnhklV-igrA	711	740	That in certain circumstances is greater than the individual rights and in fact, they do not necessarily trump public health and that in fact, in the instances here, you know, some of us are old enough to remember pre-vaccine days, and polio, one a particular anxiety and you mentioned that your dad, which means he's probably of my generation which has me a little, you know, concerned here that...
5210	Anderson	Joel	57	vEySB-JPx9Q	623	654	And, I think that if our opinion is that we just want to throw people in jail and lock the key and forget about them, that's one strategy, but if we want to empower those people to have some chance at a productive life in society, instead of this turntable that keeps eleasing them and then re-incarcerating them, then we've got to change what we're doing
5211	Block	Marty	59	CKcxsxPbopg	1522	1540	Ms. Viterbi, who is Jewish, was born in 1934 in Sarajevo in the former Yugoslavia. As the USC news reported, her brothers and her parents were fleeing the city as the German army moved in as a precursor to World War II. During their escape through Italy, her father, grandfather, and two uncles were almost taken captive by the Italian army in Montenegro after a troop carrier was blown up by partisans.
5212	Bonilla	Susan	3	81AHHgExKGE	1949	1967	But I appreciate this distinction and I think that sometimes there is a benefit to state wide consistency, and uniformity. But I would be interested to hear if there is any other discussion from members and see what I decide. Thank you.
5213	Huff	Bob	105	2PhBo_voi0A	1194	1203	You can go to whichever one fits your needs the best if you can get there. And I think in publicly-funded school, a good axion is: if you can get there, you ought to be able to go there.
5214	Chavez	Rocky	83	l9VB53WlnQ0	0	18	I had the Department of Finance in my office yesterday, talking about CTE and talking about the funding, this coming into it. And then I started asking them timelines on okay, when's this money gonna be released, when do we expect this class to go, 'cause one of the components of it is that you have to show results as you go to the grant program later on.
5215	Gatto	Mike	46	WbiiRILqv6s	1075	1095	For those of you saying, "Boy, identity theft for plastic surgery, what's the world coming to," we share that sentiment. I will build on that. I think that Mr. Cooper's comments on that were very well thought out and very accurate. You know, there is saying up hear that personal experiences don't always make the best law, and I think that's accurate.
5216	Nielsen	Jim	68	fPXDsUW3HWg	283	300	And that's understood, okay fine. Get back to, I have, this is one I have to complain of process. Most of this budget has been very accommodating really in the process. A young gentlemen just testified on the bill before last saying there's been too insufficient time to evaluate.
5217	Block	Marty	59	CKcxsxPbopg	1540	1557	However, an Italian officer showed compassion and let them go because he didn't want to see the young Erna cry at the the site of her relatives in handcuffs. While the family went on to safety in Parma, Italy and then Switzerland to wait out the war before settling in California.
5218	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	ymi21hh5WVg	855	883	Don't. And so and I understand there might be some concerns, and I suspect they're being addressed and will continue to be addressed, this being one of them. But in terms of prospective, and this was a question, it's my understanding that it's very difficult to determine what's old ivory and what's I mean, I know mine is old cuz I got it when I was five and ten years old and I'm old, and so I know it was old when I got it.
5219	McGuire	Mike	93	EhsW00cBA0A	160	181	Right now, CAL FIRE can't respond to this area without the sheriff's office, CHP, or armed personnel going in prior to the engines moving in. Trinity county has nine total deputies, it's a County of about 15,000. If you're to flatten Trinity county and get rid of the Alps it would be the size of Texas.
5220	Bonilla	Susan	3	ASNmI2rHU9I	1087	1099	What information is out there, and how can it be used, and, and is there a way to make it more transparent and usable for us on this issue of price gouging or profits, or whatever it is we, we might be concerned about?
5221	Monning	Bill	25	8ENPCPUYlKU	1605	1628	Thank you Madam Chair, under motions and resolutions members there's a letter at the desk requesting withdrawal of Assembly Bills 35 to 66 to 43, 604 and 134 and Senate resolution 52 from Committee and order the measures to third reading.
5222	Mitchell	Holly	64	ISFND_-5pCw	221	244	So everybody had ample time to weigh in and raise issues, particularly when we're being asked by the Consumer Federation of California to punt and to quote, perhaps the Rules Committee can convene a special meeting in December when we are not in session. So that's a major ask.
5223	Stone	Jeff	26	rn8iMdWxrk0	471	482	Further, this bill is very clear on the types of sporting events at which these raffles can be held, whether or not you like raffles, I'm asking you to join me in supporting SB 549.
5224	Stone	Mark	20	jIa2_lUgVm8	403	428	But yet, these are schools that have courses that accredited to go on to the UC. So I'm assuming that they have to be done in a particular way. As I read the morality clause, a teacher then who is teaching a class, that would then be accredited to go to the UC might actually be violating the clauses as I've read them.
5225	Allen	Benjamin	70	0IRzh1yPHfU	1266	1281	I understand that the staff recommended an amount that was higher than the LAO's. Though certainly nowhere near the Governor's proposal. They're both saying to us that they've had a thoughtful analysis, analytical approach to deriving these numbers.
5226	Gallagher	James	108	5Qw_YsDfvQ4	425	458	That's a vital program which I was part of, I learned many great leadership skills in that program. And Assembly Member Perea and I had the opportunity to meet with many of these young individuals as they came to the capital last week as they participated in the Sacramento leadership experience. We need to support those students and support the next generation of agriculture so that we can continue to produce the most wholesome nourishing food that the world benefits from. So thank you and I ask for your support on this resolution
5227	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	oGlT-6EtEZU	1294	1313	I want to support California with all due respect to Canada, it's a great place but these are our people, the economy, the work that people have, the family owned businesses. I mean, it just sounds like a great TV show. All the good guys in the room.
5228	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	Sai1lZPOK9g	642	669	I just think going back a 115 years really takes that away and that's why I asked that you make it prospective rather than retroactive. So I'm gonna have to oppose the bill, but appreciate and hope that you appreciate too that it's not because of any lack of concern or empathy, on behalf of my own family I hope my Zayde isn't rolling over in his grave.
5229	Stone	Jeff	26	E_gAhll2czw	501	517	He retired as director of engineering after over 40 years of loyal service work with Roseanne. Jerry was an avid tennis player, snow skier, and golfer. He loved the outdoors and spent many weekends vacationing, hunting, fishing, riding motorcycles, and camping with family and friends. He was always there to help another in need, say a kind word, or just land an ear of support.
5230	Leyva	Connie	62	qM5DAHMb8ig	1678	1695	Healthcare should be a right for everyone. It should not be a privilege for everyone. It is well and long documented that emergency room care is the worst care. Not because our emergency room folks aren't very talented, but that's not where you're supposed to go for your care unless there's an emergency.
5231	Allen	Benjamin	70	YCiZz_ZRK7I	551	563	Okay, this is helpful. One of the things I should mention to the panelists, and also the folks who are gonna be coming up later, we're gonna be having a hearing on some of these very same issues, and looking at this from a statewide perspective on I think March 25th
5232	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	11yyICoQ5m8	419	433	I was in tears, too, I'm a grandma. So I've got a two year old granddaughter, and I could think, my goodness, if she were born with some of the needs of this child, and what we all would do to try to help those children, and as a society, what we should all do.
5233	McGuire	Mike	93	qbDN-8u61LI	65	76	More than any other, this Committee understands the urgent need for the legislature to act on medical marijuana and your report makes some excellent points and recommendations related to the bill.
5234	Williams	Das	12	P6cBeme--dw	157	188	Members, if we endorse this for people who are not facing symptoms then we are endorsing people taking one's life for reasons other than pain. What would those reasons be? Fear of the diagnosis, sadness, depression. I would argue that we never want to be a society that endorses taking one's life for those reasons.
5235	Bonta	Rob	85	kWtMirkLI5M	1066	1088	Absolutely critical that patient safety and care in health is uplifted and prioritized as well as work replacement and relocation. So I think that the tool and the vehicle for providing that input and driving the process, including potentially changing the deadlines to accommodate these needs and interests to the best of our ability if possible would be through the stakeholder process.
5236	Lara	Ricardo	107	uM-vqP4Hv8s	479	491	This is a cost impact-- this is a cost impact to the state when workers pay the benefits and is undermined and employees must rely on public programs for assistance and healthcare.
5237	Stone	Jeff	26	uymj8kL8SYs	1440	1457	Senator, you also represent an area with a large mountain community, I represent an area that has a large mountain community, and there's been, you know, arguments that some of our citizens are being triple taxed. I don't know what the situation is in San Bernardino, but I'd like to learn about it.
5238	Weber	Shirley	44	Jy18DQ2_OCI	661	674	I don't know if it came from the board. I think it came from the rank and file in terms of the back log that's there and the need for additional staffing to respond to the issues that are before the PERB at this time. That there's been a Loss in positions, thirteen positions they've lost.
5239	Hill	Jerry	66	xJqN87zbSDI	466	493	Mr. Chair if I could, I think that's an appropriate amount of time and with the new system and certainly with the ability to gather greater financial information on those responsible parties. It may be easier to get that 5000 or less in the future, so I think that we're giving them a great deal of authority that could improve that situation tremendously, so I think that's a good timeframe.
5240	Gaines	Ted	24	CKAXbjP6mGQ	275	313	Thank you very much Madame President and members. And, I just want-to take this opportunity, if I could, to take this indulgence to introduce my family. I've got my mother and my father and Bob and Winnie Gaines and then also my two sisters Claire and Margaret. They've just come to visit and they mean so much to me. Family is just so critical that we support our families and we have a duty and responsibility as Californians to do that.
5241	Nazarian	Adrin	36	kIKVbsrTmqg	1145	1166	So is there -- When we say that we don't have the money to take this in to consideration, is there an opportunity to figure out the alternative cost of what it would cost us based on percentages of services and dollars not spent? Dollars not spent today and services not realized today.
5242	Fuller	Jean	49	9celf0om_Bo	1541	1572	I have no disagreement with either the author or the number of bills. I just think that I do remember having all those people come forward and ask, and we sort of made them justify by an explanation of what they're going to use it for, how many they had, and then if we all felt comfortable, that that was something that they needed, and in this case it sounds like it is, and then we can move forward with that.
5243	Leno	Mark	60	hSwKpjUIVVQ	1657	1667	And I recognize we did eliminate many, many commissions when we had to tighten our belt a few years ago, and we're not suggesting we revisit all of those commissions that we cut.
5244	Eggman	Susan Talamantes	73	GV2uLrBMX6U	787	811	It brings to mind to me the work Gloria Anzalda, who wrote years ago about the border lands and as we think about those farm workers we think about they were citizens of Pueblo, Mexico. They were residents of Stockton, California and they died in the borderline between Ms. Olsen's district and mine out in the eastern San Joaquin Valley.
5245	Wood	Jim	72	iF8zLPAheNg	409	424	This account will be used to pay for local and state enforcement pertaining to cannabis activities. The account will also pay for remediation of environmental impacts of illegal and legal cannabis cultivation. I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
5246	Nielsen	Jim	68	S3aN4yPTnBE	1304	1324	Well, I was just kind of fondly acknowledging a friend up there, you know. Well, I must sort of wistfully say that, you know, if you've not been at the Igo Cemetery on a kind of stormy, but where the storm is breaking, spring, early spring day.
5247	Bonta	Rob	85	eOaXlPRJTVY	1450	1457	Thank you Dr. Wood. And I've heard you make that very compelling point a number of times in this committee and our joint hearing. So that's something we'll look at closely.
5248	Liu	Carol	63	670ewxdSqNM	1486	1504	Just to go back to, Senator Hancock's request for a periodic update, from, I guess all three of you, cause you're all working together. 30 days, ten days, what do you suggest? What's convenient for you?
5249	Pavley	Fran	104	UOAgtw9idpM	1273	1293	There is no substantial change to the bill. This bill is not a placeholder for expanding it any further there's no opposition to the bill. It is supported by Aqua, I ask for your aye vote (move the bill).
5250	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	0HDXR-Yl1D8	442	469	So colleagues, we're gonna go quickly to file item 11, which is the state bar dues bill. And if I'm gonna pass the gavel over to my co-chair, Senator Moorlach.
5251	Levine	Marc	8	WL8066nF9bw	1289	1302	Thank you very much for that, Mr. Chair and thank you committee members. In 1993, Congress passed a federal law known as Motor Voter. Motor Voter was intended to allow ease of voter registration through a variety of governmental services.
5252	Cooley	Ken	45	ITEaoTWbk6c	1851	1864	And so the signal thing here, this is water policy but it's also how we function as an institution, how we collaborate on the institution, how we address matters and put things behind us so we can move on to the next item in the queue.
5253	Leno	Mark	60	u1CD9eH0kHI	1641	1659	Because if it's $4, $6, somewhere in that neighborhood. I think that's something we could explain to our constituents as opposed to if it were a $50 or $100 a month increase, which is a very difficult thing to explain to our constituents.
5254	Nielsen	Jim	68	zO-5FwV_Tmk	1192	1215	And I do not fault the Chairman, he's always been as agreeable as he possibly can. But to cut off even from consideration, other ideas of other members. And to have rejected throughout the budget process, other Republican ideas, short of tax increases. That's not good for the legislative process. Ladies and gentlemen of the public, I speak to you. That's not good for you.
5255	Lara	Ricardo	107	tHDAU5JmwzE	1642	1666	Next item is Senator Herzberg. SB 134, State Bar voluntary fees loan repayment program. Due pass as amended per the author to limit warrants to those authorized in the state budget. Also amend to clarify fee review may be used for administrative cost. We will substitute the roll from SB 254. That bill is out on a unanimous vote of 7-0.
5256	Hill	Jerry	66	XOw47EwG8xI	1106	1118	- [Senator Hill] That tells them that it's taken three years, or it's two-and-a-half years, or it's four years. It doesn't say that our goal was 14 months or 18 months, and we've exceeded that by this much, and we're working towards reducing it.
5257	Pavley	Fran	104	45ZR2HT6sPs	534	551	We certainly don't want any other issues like fracking where you can't tell what chemicals are being used, how they're disposing of their waste fluid. The third reform is there's a little pool that allows some oil and gas related activities to avoid being reported to DOGGR.
5258	Patterson	Jim	119	wK5CwGDTeOM	1070	1090	Imagine if our students could cut the cost of their textbooks, go to the internet, go to these open sources, and do the work, and they can do the work on their time at an expense that is remarkably lower. This is a wonderful bill. I applaud the author and ask for an aye vote.
5259	Lackey	Tom	10	yAgUQvRrkrQ	687	706	And, this presentation that calls upon our federal government to be responsible. To do their job. Our President and our legislators in Washington DC have avoided this issue for decades.
5260	Hancock	Loni	98	kIQkyQM4CnQ	53	76	So it seems to me that it would be useful to continue to consider. Because I don't see why it should be a major problem having that outside person be a really nationally known expert on best practices for rehabilitation in prison.
5261	Hernandez	Ed	103	iDZCoA28Gzg	660	682	Anyone else like to comment? I think we went through the opposition this time. I will be supporting the bill. I agree with Senator Nguyen that perhaps at a later time look at it at a statewide issue. As you know it's been a rocky road to get to the point of full implementation of Cal MediConnect.
5262	Garcia	Eduardo	38	1fxZCVj9XoA	472	491	The bill takes approach where we will collect licensing fees to develop a grant program under the Department of Justice for our local law enforcement agencies to have the necessary resources to enforce the laws that already on the books and to address this escalating problem.
5263	Hertzberg	Robert	99	hp2WTRF5hkg	589	600	When you get to 35,000 gigawatt hours or 18 percent of the statewide load instead of 12, 12.5 percent, you basically are at 15.5 percent. And then you cap it. And if that happens sooner or later.
5264	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	iSM5Bpt31OQ	437	455	Five to one, that bill is out. And then we have the consent calendar. Let's go ahead and call that now, and that will bring us up to date. Move the consent calendar. Senator Ross, as 696, it's filed out of 26. It is do-- just consent, alright. Please call the roll.
5265	Dababneh	Matthew	50	Y_pbsK-_qw0	346	360	Excuse me, a refrigerator today in one month of electricity from a refrigerator from 1980. So you can see how much more efficient electronics and appliances have become in the last 30 years. And this is really, a great example of a carrot when it comes to environmental stewardship.
5266	McGuire	Mike	93	Iras-GLDTWk	2029	2044	And, SB 685 was coauthored by Democrats and Republicans alike, and I do wanna say thank you to Senator Bates, as well as Senator Nielsen for this support of the bill, and once again, I would be honored to work with you on this bill as it hits suspense.
5267	Patterson	Jim	119	17weTAXeEGA	630	656	This particular young man that my son was privileged to teach should not have made it through school and been the valedictorian. All of the pathologies were against him. He would come to school every day and his sister would take him and she would be on crack every day.
5268	Chiu	David	7	-R4HGT4UbOs	2345	2382	Thank you Mr. Wood. That concludes our adjourn in memories today. Members, please bring all names to the desk to be printed in the journal. All requests to adjourn to memory will be deemed read and printed in the journal. Moving to announcements. First on behalf of the Assembly, we'd like to offer our congratulations to our long-time sergeant, Jim Davit, on the birth of his first granddaughter. Sahari Noel E. Banks was born this morning at 5:17 and weighs 7 pounds and 5 ounces, congratulations Jim.
5269	Chiu	David	7	9-tqw489jZ4	477	647	The clerk will post. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. Close the roll. The clerk will close the roll and tally the votes. Ayes 41, no's 27. The measure passes. With that members at this time we're going to recess for an hour. Please return to the chambers probably at 2 pm. Members be sure to return at 2 pm. This house stands in recess until two o'clock.
5270	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	Mfs9_24i5lo	913	939	Because of the, the our representative from the Labor Fed said, discriminatory public policy. And there's, there's no justification in 2015, why this state allows our education service workers who are serving our kids, who are the front line, who have more touches than parents during the week on a child of from having some modicum of economic security.
5271	Beall	Jim	92	Rbv3X8-oLv8	170	185	Now it's with this purpose in mind that this conference Committee is convened. In this meeting I hope we will be able to continue the dialogue begun earlier this year to find solutions to a problem which impacts all Californians.
5272	Baker	Catharine	74	eYTxGLtgMco	1769	1783	There are numerous conversations about several of the different options that have been presented to this body, including this bill. I, in my conversations with the governor's staff, I haven't had the opportunity to meet one on one with the governor. I'm happy to do that right now.
5273	De Leon	Kevin	102	Ydll29eHOng	1813	1829	The next few days I know in Los Angeles Ben Hueso will be having an oversight hearing. With that, one small item. Monday, we will have floor session not at 2, but at 3PM. Monday 3PM.
5274	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	lr5iK8Kvlcs	266	282	Because part of that number you see in wealth is not only owning your home, but owning a business, and this may be a question for everybody that comes up, but where do you see where we can start building that kind of infrastructure for the black community.
5275	Hill	Jerry	66	ZJAG2StITgQ	2425	2465	Mr. Chair, Phil Vermeulen, represents Defense Contractors, Flash Barricade and several other contractor associations. We too would like to weigh in and say that we're proud of working with contractors board for many, many, many years and keep battling the underground economy. It's frustrating trying to play with a level field when you've got these guys that are not paying worker's comp, proper wages or anything. And so we continue to work with them to try to strengthen the laws and go after the bad guys and they're doing a great job. They've got a tremendous task and with the industry working with them, all we can do is keep plugging forward. Thank you. go after the bad guys and they're doing a great job. They've got a tremendous task and with the industry working with them, all we can do is keep plugging forward. Thank you.
5276	Pan	Richard	96	07ilphfHuEw	1055	1073	Thank you madame President, Senators. As the Senator representing Sacramento which actually has probably one of the larger numbers of state workers working within my district, I do feel like I need to respond to some of the statements that been made on the floor briefly.
5277	Wood	Jim	72	jKVkIx_af_k	1645	1662	My district is ground zero for marijuana activities, production, and environmental damages. My bill simply seeks to address the environmental issues that are having enormous effects on the residents of the district I represent, where at an estimated 60 to 70% of the marijuana consumed in the United States is grown.
5278	Pan	Richard	96	eQ53gxbhFGs	413	434	There is no distinction in terms of the cab being in motion or not. I mean, it's the licenses for the cab and requiring that you have a monitor on board and that's there a driver on board. So, it's not quite the same as having someone, just like you have people who drink on a limousine, we don't say that when a limousine stops at a red light.
5279	Weber	Shirley	44	XQwWN6GsS_M	1878	1887	That our young people have an opportunity to actually grow and develop and have a vision for themselves, as they see us work so hard to create that vision for them.
5280	Bonta	Rob	85	37JGlYuk31E	642	656	Again, I want to appreciate all of those who have driven from so far away to participate in this process. And I want to assure everyone that I certainly appreciate and value your commitment and your involvement on an issue that you are passionate about and feel strongly about.
5281	Gallagher	James	108	kLTY4thtXsA	1614	1630	Thank you Mr. Chair and members. It's my pleasure to present AB 517. Current law requires schools to possess the materials that will be distributed to students during sexual health or HIV/AIDS prevention education and allows parents to inspect these materials.
5282	Leno	Mark	60	rhpqVSvkkLg	619	645	And that as the President stated at the State of The Union Address this past year that since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. The increase in health care costs are at their lowest rate in the past 50 years. So we are containing health care costs. As a result of the bill SB 1163 of 2011, we've seen in the individual and
5283	Wieckowski	Bob	55	Pvh7fZV71H4	670	695	They're getting a big chunk of it, 31% which is close to 8% a piece versus the medium, and again, I don't know what distinguishes you from medium to small, are getting 14% for 6. So it seems like there's a favorite division based on the council's recommendation towards the small, non or small commercial airports versus the medium commercial.
5284	Baker	Catharine	74	HWoLP0nhI7A	109	123	And for example, just again, the concern of the quality of advice they get as a veteran when they come to a campus and they're somewhat isolated from others because they have a very different experience than, say, the 20-year-old who has not served.
5285	Roth	Richard	106	SCWpb6PxRGE	170	189	I don't consider these technical issues to be minor. They're not minor to me. I know very well from hearing the testimony that they're not minor to the people who've presented here today. But keep in mind we're talking about one, a small business, so it's not the larger employers, it's a small business, 25 or fewer employees.
5286	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	HgBIr1hupMw	337	369	Currently the RMR ceilings are based on data from 2009. There's less deficit factor of 10.11% which puts rates just slightly above the 2005 level, making them about a decade behind the market. Childcare programs that rely on RMR include these non traditional hours for parents again who work swing, overnight, or early morning shifts, and need 24 hour or weekend care.
5287	Leno	Mark	60	dCf0VaDDxwk	931	950	expenditures compared to where we would have been if had not been for the crisis 2008. Looking at LAO projections of where we would have been potentially 10 if not $20 billion ahead of where we are now. So we have not restored funding that we cut from the University of California,
5288	Hernandez	Ed	103	dCf0VaDDxwk	1564	1585	IHHS, what is that total dollar and then we need to decide. Okay if were going to do that, where is that dollar coming from? Is it additional revenues, whether we agree or disagree or is it through the current budget? No, but this is just sort of an overview, and then by all means we'll allow anybody to ask as many questions as they want. Anyway, Ms. Kent, please proceed
5289	Hancock	Loni	98	sVBMPES4ZsY	83	99	Because I'd like to comment that I think this is a bullying strategy, you know, social research tells us that rape is an act of power and an act of bullying and a lot of sexism is bullying.
5290	Hertzberg	Robert	99	Q5Q2oc0ttio	585	596	Two, we've required the renewable portfolio standard to be 51 percent. Current law is 31, 33 and a third percent. We wanted to increase that to make sure that whatever came on the system was green and greener.
5291	De Leon	Kevin	102	bG49iSrqac0	1016	1051	Point of personal privilege, Madame president, as well as colleagues, if I can get all our colleagues attention, Madame president's, as well as members. Today, I have the humble opportunity to introduce very special guests. Back to the State Senate. Today we will be re-dedicating the Roseanne Witch hearing room, hearing room 240, in honor of the 42 troupe blazing women Senators, who have served in the California State Senate.
5292	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	ok4qN3L6USs	1109	1122	And so you brought up the idea of grab and go. So certainly that's one of the concepts embedded in this bill too. So I appreciate you working with me and us getting to understand the issue together better, so I want to thank you for your advocacy on this effort.
5293	Leno	Mark	60	9_Ipr5dyo2o	382	415	I know that the issue of and the process of dissolving our RDAs has been a challenging one for all of us, but this bill creates some distinct and valuable opportunities for our cities and counties. Once we have taken the vote on this bill, I will be introducing a letter to the journal which attends to some outstanding issues that were brought forward in Committee and also it public comment today.
5294	Mendoza	Tony	52	kGpKuwTOA0g	662	679	There's communities in our district, and right outside of our district, that are highly concentrated with companies, Vernon, Santa Fe Springs, Commerce, the city of Industry, just to name a few. They're constantly trying to re-invent themselves, and trying to create more of a greener space
5295	Runner	Sharon	4656	ZhE_hzRecAQ	123	135	Thank you, Madame President and members. I rise to support this bill. I have a foster grandchild who was adopted by my son and his wife when he was 11.
5296	Levine	Marc	8	p1klb1Rl5Zc	1508	1524	Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chair. I'll try to keep this brief. AB 606 will increase water efficiency and reduce water consumption by requiring state agencies to adopt drought tolerant landscaping and recycled water or rainwater capture irrigation and replace existing irrigation with more efficient methods where feasible and cost-effective.
5297	Chavez	Rocky	83	vsNWmpwObU4	303	316	Granted, healthcare costs have gone up, but the pharmaceuticals, at least in all the states I've seen have been relatively flat. I'm seeing heads no's and heads yeses, maybe that shows the argument.
5298	Chavez	Rocky	83	l1HWjxTN3mM	1071	1091	In Hispanic community there's 179,867 that were denied an education. So your issue that you're talking about suspension, it's a huge problem and Superintendent Tom Torlakson mentions that and talks about how he's working and improving that and I applaud him for that.
5299	McGuire	Mike	93	gqFKPQ41Jk4	945	962	We're very aware of the Legislature's authority. I know that there are three different individuals. It was at the minimum on the State Senate side they're gonna be advancing in particular on the issue of ex parte communication I just wanted to be able to get down to where we're discussing personnel rules.
5300	Leno	Mark	60	bq30nlpq090	706	718	Thank you very much Mr. Taylor. So asI hadt suggested earlier I just spend a few minutes on the  revenue side. We have endless conversations on all the expenditure side and I'll address my comments and questions to both of you and feel free to comment and respond as you like.
5301	Chiu	David	7	FA0o_dng1YE	1907	1930	State funding on this is incredibly important and as I know the author knows I am working with Mr. Alejo on a joint effort between the Asian Pacific Islander Caucus and the Latino Caucus to move forward our One California program which would provide and really revive program from a couple years ago that to provide about $20 million for education and naturalization services.
5302	De Leon	Kevin	102	SNbIvbnUyMw	250	284	For 90% of permits. Understanding a lot of these other facilities are very complex in nature and will take a lot more time. So, we're talking two years goal, and correct me where I'm wrong, the trajectory of the Department is at 90% of the cases before you for permits to be decided, either yay or nay, within a two year time frame? Or average?
5303	Lara	Ricardo	107	pchCRkcA1Ic	139	156	Although California has made significant strides towards expanding mental health services, the Cambodian community has been largely excluded from these initiatives in part because they are collapsed together to catch, in catch-all groups such as the API category.
5304	Hall	Isadore	1	nqU0Ufhmqoo	177	204	Well, thank you for asking. I have had several conversations with the superintendant of public instruction, Tom Torlakson along with Autumn Burke who also oversees certain areas of district, discussing the challenges of the district. We are very concerned that the district is not moving at a pace, in our opinion, that is advantageous to the community.
5305	De Leon	Kevin	102	8UaA3ArF3qo	1279	1313	So what we have we have a three to zero votes obviously that is sufficient to move your nomination to the Senate Floor. Were going to keep the role open so Mr. Canella can join us in a few moments and he can add-on which I'll make the assumption in the affirmative of your confirmation of this Miss Toche, congratulations.
5306	McGuire	Mike	93	31Xp8hxYTr4	100	115	To do this SMART is going to need a sworn police chief to handle sensitive information involving the train's operations, passenger safety, facility safety, among other very important items that are going to be in front of them.
5307	De Leon	Kevin	102	CKcxsxPbopg	1246	1278	We need to make sure we get the best and brightest who are committed and invested in our students. I think clearly that all of us together stand with the students and that's why we introduce Senate bill number 15 that speaks to accessibility, affordability, and making sure these young students in the UC as well as the Cal State University system have an opportunity to succeed.
5308	Dababneh	Matthew	50	nhD8diu7eMA	799	818	Or a known assignee chosen by the policy holder. The bill will mirror the liability of an insurance agent and brokers under an e-sign provision. And provide ability for policy holder to electronically return a notice of cancellation as allowed under uniform electronic transition act currently.
5309	Mitchell	Holly	64	F-LiWOGboCo	417	430	Thank you very much, I appreciate that. First of all let me say that I want to thank the staff who worked diligently to pull together the work of the select committee. The work does not involve just what you see here.
5310	Lara	Ricardo	107	nJXs6pD2ors	1533	1553	I'm presenting Pro Tem's SB 295, which is a technical cleanup bill for the college access tax credit program established last year by legislation. He authored, the program authorizes a state tax credit equal to 60 percent of charitable contributions to the college access tax credit fund in 2004.
5311	Lara	Ricardo	107	nqU0Ufhmqoo	1163	1184	Absolutely and I actually want to Senator Hancock brings up a really good issue, which is another passion of mine, which is the academic preparation programs for first generation students. Programs like EOPS, Mesa. Programs that are geared towards African American, Latino, first generation students, which we continue to underfund in this state.
5312	Quirk	Bill	23	mEidzFiLEmY	321	347	AB 56 will regulate the use of unmanned aircraft systems by law enforcement and public agencies. As well as the dissemination use of any images, data, and footage obtained by the systems AB 56 seeks to strike a balance between the need to protect privacy and allow law enforcement to use new technology to fight crime, while also creating more transparency and accountability.
5313	Liu	Carol	63	qCvvxF6FLEU	1710	1732	The recently re-authorized federal childcare and development block grant requires a minimum of 12 months' eligibility for childrens participating in subsidized programs. Further, the federal legislation stipulates that a child should not be removed from care during the period due to the redetermination as long as the family's income does not exceed 85 percent of the state's median income.
5314	Bloom	Richard	2	wr_Nl1-RdXY	2325	2348	Fair enough. My recollection from last year is that there was, and lord knows my recollection might be off, but I don't recall having any conversation at all about reserve amounts. We spent, we didn't spend, but we didn't talk specifically about reserve, this year, I think quite appropriately we are talking reserve.
5315	McGuire	Mike	93	msHMXzeLRF8	2094	2118	We have one focus SB 238 on the foster care system in particular adding training for those that are prescribing. We have Senator Monning that would be here in just a bit, focus on dependent children. We do have one related to Mr. Beall who is going to be bringing forward a bill on child welfare services and public health nursing,
5316	Chavez	Rocky	83	ZcJSZ4qEe4Y	584	593	As you know this is a big personal issue to me. I've been involved in this for over a decade. One of the things that often come up, and I just want to hear from you, is this bill.
5317	Pan	Richard	96	XxAKuU0JQuk	1922	1932	Well, actually, with this population, even longer. If you're not taking your statins or you're not taking high blood pressure medication, that stroke that you could have averted, that's not going to show up in a three-year study.
5318	Mitchell	Holly	64	gN6B3iXXHo0	2243	2257	Thank you. This for me is reminiscent of a similar debate in this institution. I'm gonna age myself, maybe 25 years ago, when I was an advocate with the legal services organization, when we talked about lead paint.
5319	Calderon	Ian Charles	115	A2CxN21_Gyw	562	581	there is a court order because federal law only allows disclosure if only one of the parties of communication consents. AB 691 addresses this issue by striking a balance between providing a clear path for fiduciaries to access relevant information to handle the deceased person's estate
5320	Waldron	Marie	29	0pvN33z5LJg	1352	1373	You know, I would say it could be between zero up to 2.9 million. But I, all I am asking from the committee is that I could work with you to get all of us at the table to really see what this would cost because it could save people a lot of suffering. It could save lives as I've delineated.
5321	Gallagher	James	108	mEidzFiLEmY	1008	1021	So we need to stay up, on our operation and maintenance, of these facilities. You know, one question might be, why, do you care? Well, one, public safety, as we said, of the people living in these valleys.
5322	Mendoza	Tony	52	mork537FlJg	768	792	Currently this will affect only five counties. Expanding the number of supervisorial seats for the states largest counties will provide the opportunity for these bodies to be more responsive and reflective of the needs of the people they represent and serve. SCA 8 has strong and effective cost control by requiring funding of the expanded board at the 2020 to 2021 pre-expansion levels.
5323	Gallagher	James	108	mEidzFiLEmY	994	1008	Over one million people now live and work in flood plains of the Sacramento and San Joaquin river valleys and their tributaries, and there are over 69 billion dollars worth of physical, physical assets, within these flood plains.
5324	Glazer	Steve	10481	Ga_QNYq_wVM	1520	1530	Senator, thank you for your work in this area. There are a lot of notions on all sides and I appreciate how difficult it is to try to maneuver around and through it all.
5325	Thurmond	Tony	4	UMlpaC9VCt4	935	951	Again, thank you for the opportunity to present this bill. It simply looks at methane, which we know is generated from a number of sectors, many of them industrial. Obviously in my district where we have several refineries, there is a lot of methane flaring that has caused a great deal of health concerns.
5326	Thurmond	Tony	4	A6ledtIW6-Y	558	575	This subcommittee will not articulate what the closure date will be, cuz this subcommittee does not have the ability to do so. But at the end of the day, we will make decisions for each and every individual consumer, based on his individual or her individual needs, as outlined in their individual program plan.
5327	Anderson	Joel	57	omDEH7LCBKo	259	296	Absolutely. The worst thing in my mind is somebody's who's committed to changing their life, they put all the effort in, and then we fail them by putting them on a career path like Senator you just mentioned, where they have no chance of ever working in their career. I think that those things early can make a huge difference. We're putting in a lot of resources in this. You're putting a lot of time and thought and I'm thinking this is not about box checking, but outcomes.
5328	Pan	Richard	96	uUsytMtXn1I	749	773	Thank you. So Senator Gatto, I guess the first question I have is, so you mentioned they keep the spots, do they tie the sample to identifiable information about the child? Or is it simply they're keeping different samples of blood spots? Can it be traced back to a particular person? Are they identified, my understanding is that they've been de-identified.
5329	Hueso	Ben	48	218-RTK66_I	430	450	I feel that it's imperative that the Legislature fix something that was identified as problem with this act, and work to ensure the voters see laws that they support be put in the books that address issues of providing safety and security in our communities.
5330	Patterson	Jim	119	Om99VHbxcmc	456	488	I think part of the modernization and renewal that you wish to take advantage of and move forward has to do with the big broad general reassessment of the manner in which the rules, the regulations, and the patterns and practices of those kinds of hearings. To say to the question that Mr. Obernolte asked, I don't know when we will get an answer, is to essentially say there is not an answer.
5331	Runner	Sharon	4656	dUxLQJsTkyU	940	955	I'm turning my microphone on. Happy to be here today, and that you've reached an agreement. I was in a meeting yesterday with Joe Dylan from the Governor's office and Senator Anderson's office, and it was revealed at that time that Senator Anderson is one of your neighbors.
5332	Hueso	Ben	48	218-RTK66_I	472	489	So we are still working on the bill, and we are working to address some of the concerns that have been raised, not only by the courts, but by the Committee process and by people within the capitol addressing some of the concerns related to cost.
5333	Pavley	Fran	104	_H7zvwgU_3w	1057	1077	Well, the current thing is through 2020, but the executive orders by Governor Schwarzenegger extend that to 2050 targets. And the 2050 targets came based on the science. So by 2020, we roll them back hopefully back to 1990 levels.
5334	Hueso	Ben	48	218-RTK66_I	510	527	The amendments we have prepared narrow the definition of an Internet identifier, it removes the provision that make the bill available to the public through the Attorney General's Office, and expressly prohibits the information from being available to the public, except by court order.
5335	Anderson	Joel	57	bcyIxM2tSYs	1218	1238	I think that having 29 days is great. I don't think that that solves the problem of people there on poverty line who, having to pay for a cab, or pay for Uber, or whoever they use, means that they're gonna have to change their meal plan for that month.
5336	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	rNW_uEjgPtM	1983	2000	Senator, I stand corrected, I'm easily confused, of course. All right, so with that, I think the assemblyman is gonna ask for an aye vote, and Madam Secretary there is a motion due pass to a senate appropriations. Please call the roll.
5337	Thurmond	Tony	4	ZUYUeUTz98c	701	720	If we're looking at programs to nursing home, nursing facility programs that serve folks with crises and critical health needs, the Saving Grace of Opportunity, so from the standpoint at least from the chair, you can go back and tell folks that we ask that you re-allocate the money in similar ways and not just put it in the General Fund.
5338	Hernandez	Ed	103	oSf6dq0DzcI	1514	1554	Any other questions from any members? I have a couple comments with regard to Mr. Felix Su, I appreciate your remarks and I know that your presentation was focused mainly on Medi-Cal Managed Care, the Department of Managed Healthcare, you need to address the fee for service issue. My concern is we have a fee for service 20%, Medi-Cal Managed Care 80%, but within the Medi-Cal Managed Care, you mention that not all entities are under the Department of Managed Healthcare, and I believe there's only one code, which Santa Clara, you said?
5339	Alejo	Luis	9	Q9Mn4k8Lves	64	72	Mr. Nielsen, I look forward to maybe sitting, having a one on one with you about the bill. But we've done a lot of work, this is my third year actually working on this bill.
5340	Cannella	Anthony	61	XFSLCFM97Og	846	860	So there's a lot of layers, and it's tough just to work within our own government structure. So I appreciate what you're doing, and I think we still got a lot of work to do to make sure that the most needy in our community get the resources they're due.
5341	Cooper	Jim	21	ufpnr2TGLO8	257	274	Thank you, Mr. Cooley, for convening this. I'm glad to be on it. Down in my area, [UNKNOWN] and Elk Grove, we have the largest number of foster children in the region. It's a big school district, so a lot folks down there. We have kids in group homes and also kids in foster homes down there. So I think it's very important.
5342	Chiu	David	7	XBK8TgfRp6Y	1164	1184	I first want to say to Miss Troua Pham, thank you, because you represent 100,000 nail salon workers in the State of California. You represent a quarter million cosmetology workers in our state and I think we all appreciate how courageous it is for you to step up.
5343	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	5jUUOwMdhxk	881	892	I knew it would be controversial, we checked before we decided to put it in. That being said, I appreciate all the concerns you brought here. I do want to remind people that this is a process.
5344	Hertzberg	Robert	99	gnd2v7Ro_Uo	7	54	Senator Alejo. Do we have any other authors here? For Donalds? So we've got two items on consensus. File item 3, file item 4, and file item 8. We just need one more member for a quorum I can do, then I can do consent calendar. Hello, Doctor.
5345	Weber	Shirley	44	mOH5gnV89FM	1402	1435	Five, it includes a bare-bone cap and trade allocation of 227 million to keep the programs operating for the remainer of this year. That funding would then continue the job related programs, provides funding for electrical vehicles until 2016, includes funding to provide technical assistance to disadvantage communities, and this small package still allows for discussion to continue regarding the remaining $1.7 billion balance in greenhouse gas reductions fund. I respectfully ask for an aye vote for SB101.
5346	Leno	Mark	60	PyDS77ZdGH4	429	441	We really appreciate your joining us today Mr. Davis and for many number of really valuable suggestions you've made, we're taking notes.  And thank you Mr. Ziegler for your patience.
5347	Roth	Richard	106	YKXU5BUfkbE	1263	1274	I do think we need to hold folks accountable for the money that they receive. We need to make sure that they set appropriate goals and objectives with respect to this sort of effort.
5348	Anderson	Joel	57	u1CD9eH0kHI	1179	1187	Well, I wasn't thinking about something different, I was thinking about serving that population as opposed to going to the general fund. I'm sorry sir, did you have a response?
5349	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	D-fVk6CkUDE	53	66	I normally would have waived presentation, but my concern was that the description of the fiscal impact by the Department of Industrial Relations is so flawed, quite frankly, I had to come.
5350	Anderson	Joel	57	j1Gi-ueVYBU	5	26	I have a quick question from the opposition. The fellow that came up who had the concern? In the use of your UAV, what is the maximum height that you can still track your streams?
5351	Wieckowski	Bob	55	yhx1NvxzAgA	2101	2127	But I don't know enough about crimes against humanity because my colleague is talking about this area of jurisprudence and how these systematic crimes. I read about it and I see the television, but I don't have an understanding of the injustice that I believe the author has is that these are not like one of Wieckowski's debt buyer bills.
5352	Atkins	Toni	110	mOqF8MknDiY	318	331	Recent amendments have also made clear that 20% of the funds will go towards affordable homeownership. The American dream can still be in reach for low income Californians, and my bill will help make that a reality.
5353	Wilk	Scott	19	RsqrHgBrOM8	200	217	Okay. AB85 clarifies a loophole in the Bagley-Keene Act in order to ensure state boards and agencies are conducting all meetings in an open transparent manner. Current law allows agencies to exploit the loophole and has become a common practice to establish two member bodies in order not to hold public meetings.
5354	McGuire	Mike	93	YZmREa72UrQ	602	622	The Smith is also the primary source for drinking water for Del Norte county's 28,000 residents. The Smith river is in danger of future mining activities which will unnecessarily put the people and the wildlife that rely on the Smith at risk. Any level of contamination would have devastating and irreversible impacts in the entire watershed.
5355	Rodriguez	Freddie	69	-kB_gg_15b8	55	67	Surge capacity is the ability of our healthcare system to respond to a widespread of disease or mass casualty events, and to adequately care for the sudden influx of patients with common or unusual medical needs.
5356	Quirk	Bill	23	LoBHmtPnzP4	766	784	It would certain help in the morning peak, but it certainly isn't gonna be available in the earliest part of the morning peak. So I'm hoping that when the ISO comes up, they can give us some more quantitative answer to that. We know how to do storage at a relatively.
5357	McGuire	Mike	93	hD4FtISaTV8	853	862	I would like to be able to introduce Ken Berrick. He's the Executive Director of Seneca Family of Agencies and Mr. Berrick is gonna be giving us his testimony. Thank you sir for being here.
5358	Garcia	Cristina	112	6qpSAuN2om0	822	850	AB 365 will require the courts to allow any detained or deported to present testimony and evidence by electronic means in court order child custody mediations upon requests. Electronic means includes a telephone, video conferencing, or the internet, provided that their use is consistent with the due process of all parties. This measure will have minor and observable general fund cost. I respectfully ask for an aye vote.
5359	Bonilla	Susan	3	MhEV1ONtJ2I	73	90	And so, in your opinion, how can we go back to that beginning point and make sure that we are actually on a level playing field when it comes to these very high-level negotiations with an awful lot at stake?
5360	Thurmond	Tony	4	mYMmmzreoTQ	490	509	And I can't tell you how many of the speakers spoke to having to eat at the local food shelter. I believe that all Californians deserve better than that, and what we what we determined and saw in our Budget Subcommittee is that there's been no COLA for SSI and SSP for many years.
5361	Garcia	Cristina	112	60U_LMI0eIw	1066	1083	But I definitely think there's space to improve on things like labeling how each needs to come with education is also for folks who are in the field working what's out there. But most of our consumers are not aware and are looking for the cheapest deal.
5362	Dahle	Brian	47	DaiegGG5yrM	1517	1529	As you know, we worked on forestry bills because we have large forest fires and we are emitting a lot of carbon. And you could, in some of these fires, you could take every car out of the state of California from the amount of carbon that they're emitting.
5363	Fuller	Jean	49	FHGwb8kBog8	812	828	And, if you're a very smart person, I know that about you. If you can stand up to this test then I would be very glad to vote for your reappointment. In fact, I will probably take you out and buy you a drink.
5364	Mitchell	Holly	64	HebbT5qrJn8	1707	1726	I would agree with you that it's not the best measure and, if I were a betting woman, Mr. Bland, I don't know that we're gonna be penalized. Our California congressional delegation is too large to let that happen to us. As the kids say, I'm just saying.
5365	Stone	Jeff	26	ymi21hh5WVg	1469	1499	And then the last thing that I'm concerned about is if this comes down without any amendments to my concerns, that you're going to be creating more scarcity of a product that is, unfortunately, desired by many especially in Asian countries. I'm worried that we're gonna increase the bounty on further massacres of these beautiful animals.
5366	Rendon	Anthony	120	pqf8UezhQwo	984	1005	Like many of you, I've read over the past month or so, the Strumwasser report, the O'Neill report, which detail in great depth some of the problems at the PUC relating to inappropriate contacts between PUC staff, PUC commissioners, and those folks who they're meant to regulate.
5367	Leno	Mark	60	Jy18DQ2_OCI	1029	1047	We will be dealing with today, given that we will need further briefing, when we complete this item we're going to adjourn for the day, allowing us to complete our work on the floor and then tomorrow, conference at 11?
5368	Alejo	Luis	9	iC_rNxIxppg	586	631	Thank you very much Mr. Beltran for that work. Appreciate it. To all of you, I want to thank you for coming and we're going to call up our next witnesses, but I just wanted to, just to recap some of the points that people shared. I think it has been very helpful because we've heard, you know, that some of these solutions or ideas are not new. Some of these challenges I know they have existed for a long-time. Sometimes the local politics, they didn't allow some of those solutions to move forward, but we're hoping that because it's hurt so many families so hard right now during this worse of droughts, that hopefully we can bring people together to find those solutions and have real long-term solutions move forward, as you expressed Mr. Beltranthat these are these were talked about 10, 15 years ago.
5369	McCarty	Kevin	22	-cLGc0E6Jd8	126	142	So, the amount of money going from the general fund to the segment, whether it's the direct appropriation to the University of California, or kind of back door via the Student Aid Commission and what they get reimbursed for their student tuition has been increasing over those years.
5370	De Leon	Kevin	102	NPktHkkmjlQ	1586	1611	So we will continue to work on these aspects right now, but I just want to also say, this is also a window of a lot of compromise, on both sides coming to the table. Especially to the men and women who made it, lost a day of wages to come up here. They're owed a lot of debt of gratitude for really stretching on this issue. And with that, I respectfully ask for an aye vote.
5371	Cooper	Jim	21	elRk6CudldM	2215	2223	Sounds like the votes may be here and may not who knows but I'm saying are you willing to work, willing to work with Mr. Gordon, he's the one, I rectify this.
5372	Bonilla	Susan	3	7aIanLUJ17E	470	487	Right now we have a ruling that was challenged using an attorney general legal opinion, which states that California statute must expressly authorize these ordinances. So what AB 451 does is remedy this issue by providing definitive clarity.
5373	Alejo	Luis	9	SHuB-iUXJvo	436	459	narrowly tailored in regards to the case of identity theft and mistaken identity. And I would assume that there is these cases that do happen. But I'm sure they're a smaller percentage of the overall legitimate debts that people do not pay. So that's what we're trying to address, it's not the majority of the case, it's a narrowly,
5374	Brown	Cheryl	13	g07XaAgsb-U	418	433	That's okay. That's okay. I wanted to know in the other question I wrote was in your presentation you spoke about all of, are we going the right direction, so forth so on, and I've had people call me as a business owner
5375	Leno	Mark	60	1XQMI2ofb7Y	964	976	That the information we got from Finance at that time was this is, not only do we want to see raised to 40 million but this is the last year we're going to be doing this.
5376	Gray	Adam	27	cmFW6p4IGdA	656	670	 Thank you. Okay, do I have additional questions? Seeing none, thank you for your testimony. And we'll go ahead, and move on to the California Horse Racing Board. Rick Baedeker, executive director.
5377	Pan	Richard	96	TAMG_ZP0HjY	894	911	Alright, and I too just wanna thank all the panelists and the public comment as well. I think that it was very informative and hopefully we had a lot of very important information that was presented that will help us guide making the right kind of decisions in our state.
5378	Monning	Bill	25	9eA3HqZp1ws	1995	2009	Thank you, Madame President and members. The Senate will be in recess until 3:30, at which time the adjournment motion will be made. We will reconvene Friday morning at 9:00 A.M. Members, Friday morning, 9:00 A.M. Thank you.
5379	Rodriguez	Freddie	69	VkWyifymNDY	650	664	Okay, I wanna thank you for your comments. I know we went a little bit longer than anticipated, but I wanna thank everybody for having this very informative discussion and important for that matter, regarding 911 systems in the state of California.
5380	Pavley	Fran	104	AI_qbYqntVY	162	184	We looked at the plug-in hybrids, the electric hybrid combination plug-in and so this bill authorizes then an, an additional 15,000 green stickers. That means single occupant drive in the HOV lanes for those plug-in hybrids. That will lead us eventually to all electric vehicles for a new cap of 85,000.
5381	Grove	Shannon	77	9NVb2cnRnt4	172	184	Then there could be and I bet money on it, I'd bet dinner on there is money out there because it's been proven, because we've all been subjected to those headlines of very thing that I just mentioned:
5382	Quirk	Bill	23	8MjX_09Duus	1317	1334	For example, if the city in the first  30 days comes forward and said, this requires a sequel review, then the shot clock is stopped while the sequel review goes on, and then started again after. So there are other circumstances as well.
5383	Monning	Bill	25	Zk_K_zhn8-Q	376	403	To the contrary, the need is growing and the provider base is shrinking. So, I'm just curious from both the Administration and the LAO and, again, I'm picking on a particular area but it's one that I know in my district we've received a lot of concern and it's not a new concern it seems every budget cycle this community is frozen at 2006 rate levels.
5384	Lackey	Tom	10	vPceAWe-pfQ	324	342	Then in 2014 Governor Brown signed into law Assembly Bill 1443, Protecting Interns Under FEHA. However, this bill does not protect Reserve Peace Officers from discrimination. Even if the Estrada case established them as volunteers, today, interns have more rights than a reserve officer.
5385	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	0HDXR-Yl1D8	418	442	That's 7-0. That bill is out. Thank you very much, Senator Hueso. Could I have just a moment? With the indulgence of the committee, I would like an opportunity to jump out of order, and present the state bar bill, if I may do that. It should take five minutes. I am told there is no opposition. Would there be any objection to that?
5386	Ting	Philip	30	gCIqBFhj-A8	1893	1909	So, I know for California's major issues it's even probably more important in our Bay Area, and I just very much appreciate the update. But also very much look forward to how we contain and move forward. I know that there's a lot of resources that we need to deploy.
5387	Gallagher	James	108	-R4HGT4UbOs	1715	1739	And in that selflessness, we saw that they conquered and put down the greatest threat to liberty that we've that the world has probably ever known in the nazi regime in Germany. And ultimately when they came back, they ultimately through their leadership over the years, oversaw the fall of another authoritarian regime, in the USSR.
5388	Bonta	Rob	85	Htnfsa9QnRM	738	761	AB 176 addresses this data gap by requiring the Department of Healthcare Services, the Department of Managed Care and our public higher education institutions to use disaggregated data categories for each major Asian and Pacific Islander group. The bill also requires those entities to make the data publicly available on their website and in each demographic report released by the institution.
5389	Stone	Mark	20	9Kkq97ccCr8	642	652	And then there are retroactivity. That's not something that you had brought up. The other issues you brought up with me before, but that was the claim that was made here. Perhaps you could address those.
5390	Hertzberg	Robert	99	0yf1SfBcDOs	1564	1576	That in fact, we wouldn't be really solving the problem and this is what I see as the start of that political football, but I think it's really important to understand, in the larger dynamic, what the purpose of that was and why this Legislature and the Governor voted for it.
5391	De Leon	Kevin	102	mgO95LX_sqE	138	163	$36 billion over a course of 30 years. Although Measure R is drastically changing transportation in Los Angeles, the bottom line is that with the largest, most congested county in the country, we drastically need more investments. Residents, local government, as well as transportation bipartisan leaders in the region support thousands of worthy projects.
5392	Bates	Pat	58	_Bb4hK8XVqo	963	991	Well, Senator, it's something that is an issue that has to be vetted because it is different, there's no cookie cutter answer to those and I think what's really a problem is if they don't have the matching grant funds to accomplish their project, whereas bigger counties and self-help counties have already planned on that. So those are some of the nuanced issues that need to be discussed more in depth.
5393	Cooley	Ken	45	g465sM88Jms	157	180	We know where, there's tremendous demand unfortunately for these services. 21, 000 calls a year go into the hotlines that support these types of victims in our county. 21,000 a year. And so that's what this bill is designed to do, authorize the county to establish this type of charge.
5394	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	eGYOhkRkhDU	1343	1366	Just a couple thoughts. Obviously, to catch this on the front end saves you a heck of a lot on the back end, and so I appreciate your recognizing the importance of doing this. And, we just have far too many people who have taken no responsibility whatsoever for creating the conditions that they have,
5395	Hertzberg	Robert	99	UAhBnrBfz1o	1626	1644	But I would argue that, in terms of the customer experience, the consumer, why they're frustrated with government, why they have this stuff. We say, okay, we got our piece of the rock. We got our piece. And ever since Prop 13 passed in 1978, our entire government has been about figuring out how we can slice that thinner, and thinner and thinner.
5396	Garcia	Cristina	112	xdTTK0YoutY	1462	1480	Members, with me today are members of the Caravana 43, Caravan 43. They are family members and fellow students of the 43 students that went missing in Iguala, Mexico. They are here to participate in a forum regarding human right abuses. I encourage members to drop by
5397	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	dAgT763r35w	510	535	And I appreciate your highlighting this and appreciate Senator Wolk for bringing this forward. There are safety concerns. There are privacy concerns. And I know going forward many of us recall the days when we actually introduced privacy into the Constitution of the State of California through an initiative, back many years ago when even I was still young.
5398	Monning	Bill	25	qjDm_sZ-lfo	697	720	It's not the case right now, and the example you read of that ad, I don't hear anything in the opposition position that would support the promise made in that advertisement. So, I think the challenge is to have the precision that allows legitimate services that you, in your own words, don't disagree with,
5399	Gomez	Jimmy	80	Rbv3X8-oLv8	1427	1446	So the plan that you present is about a $36 billion, $37 billion plan over 10 years, but the administration has planned out a $57 billion backlog, and right now you're claiming that we'll get to 90% good condition on our roads.
5400	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	B4ry1_3tU0U	1332	1357	And we had these exact same fights with AILA over [AB]1159. And it's amazing to me because what we were afraid of, is that Congress wouldn't act. And that things that happen in my district, and I'm sure some of yours; billboards that go up, that the billboards from an attorney who say on the billboard they're an AILA attorney, and say: "Get in line first for immigration reform act services."
5401	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	dAgT763r35w	486	510	And the use of drones on private property with the consent of the rancher, farmer, I think is a magnificent way that we can deal with the challenges associated with the drought, with pests, with the need for applications to protect farmlands so that we do no less and no more than we need are terrific.
5402	Gomez	Jimmy	80	kJUQLNRw8o8	200	231	Mr. Alejo thank you so much for working on this issue.  Okay. Thank you so much for working on this issue. This was last year, we had the ground water legislation. It was somewhat contentious so, we, it got passed and now one of the commitments I made was to, help on the process of, taking care of any of the concerns that the opposition had.
5403	Pavley	Fran	104	xWeGZjC2Elo	52	74	I wanted to clarify the statistics. Eleven western states have these requirements, and it's public information. It's so public that 10 of those 11 states actually have it online. We have a very sort of... I would call it a compromise with them in that it's not online.
5404	Leno	Mark	60	vEySB-JPx9Q	929	949	And, the reason the Governor did this is because these chemicals are associated with cancer and decreased fertility, hormone disruption, lower IQ's, hyper activity, though it is not yet determined, there's a growing body of evidence there's even association with autism.
5405	Alejo	Luis	9	dAAyQzjyhS0	372	387	But, just for the record, my wife just finished being mayor for the City of Watsonville, but she's a proud person who grew up in Tulare County, and that's when we're not in the Salinas Valley, were visiting beautiful parts Tulare County.
5406	Chiu	David	7	bgwj3wqmbCQ	29	47	The final question I have has to do with certification. I wanted to ask: is there any cost to our state in allowing these credits to be certificated. I think the idea of not allowing our hard-earned California dollars to go to the feds, and really try to capture that ourselves makes a lot of sense, but could you address that?
5407	Cannella	Anthony	61	2aI5J_1P430	844	856	And it's unfortunate that we have such a low dedication of general fund dollars to something that is, so important to Californians, like transportation. So, it just can't be new taxes, over new taxes over new taxes and I'm not saying, we shouldn't have that discussion. We should have that discussion, but it's the last part of the discussion.
5408	Gordon	Richard	117	ES_o9sm3ARk	64	81	Specifically, AB 1239 will establish a tire recycling incentive program to provide an incentive payment to end users of recycled tires including local governments that use tires as rubberized payment as well as California manufacturers who produce consumer products using recycled tires.
5409	Chang	Ling Ling	18	CVYbaFO-ROE	882	895	The decision was met with a great deal of criticism, including from our own Lieutenant Governor, who called the decision bad for California taxpayers and at odds with the university's long and proud tradition of nurturing innovative technologies that have powered our economy.
5410	Gordon	Richard	117	ES_o9sm3ARk	50	63	This is part of Cal Recycles five-year plan. AB 1239 will help expand the state's tire recycling infrastructure to reduce greenhouse gases, create jobs, and cut the statewide and local costs associated with tire pile clean up.
5411	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	kjbtobUTSlE	1248	1263	Thank you Senator Nielsen an extraordinary man indeed in spite of all the falderol here I'm sure we're all wanting to extend our heart-felt best wishes to his family. Senator Lara for what purpose sir?
5412	Leno	Mark	60	AKlY8gGN95I	1294	1305	And they've taken matters into their own hands, as I said. Over half the state is already living under these regulations with e-cigarettes defined as tobacco products, and clearly the industry is thriving.
5413	Leyva	Connie	62	6UU1hF1F-fc	1447	1458	But as I said in energy committee, I still have some strong, strong concerns and reservations with Uber and Lyft, and I think we'll see that coming up in the next coming weeks.
5414	Hancock	Loni	98	rW1B4Jx9iIw	111	123	Today we're going to spend the morning looking at what we know about what is happening here in California, and what we need to know to do our jobs better.
5415	De Leon	Kevin	102	xrb7OkoktfM	1977	1997	Thank you very much, Senator Bill Monning, for that wonderful introduction of one of the true treasures that we have here in the United States, and that is Dolores Huerta. Bienvenida, felicidades companera. With that, one announcement, immediately upon adjournment of our Senate Floor session today, right out these two doors, we have
5416	Block	Marty	59	jjB76hKrhNA	1331	1346	They lost their lives in an attack that was clearly the result of anti-semitism and an attack that made no sense. That there was not even an excuse they were publishing anything offensive, which of course is a totally unacceptable excuse, but there was no reason for this
5417	Block	Marty	59	jjB76hKrhNA	1346	1362	slaughter. Fortunately, a young muslim woman who worked in the market, Lassana Bathily, was a hero. She led 15 of the hostages away from the terrorists and found refuge for them in the walk-in freezer. Without that,
5418	Williams	Das	12	OVIQdDmHNzI	2157	2187	But it does raise serious questions. I think, it's pretty clear from the timeline that the oil company did not comply with state law on the response required, in notification. And of course, that delayed boats being deployed, which meant that most of the cleanup was the next day because of what is an important state law to ensure timely cleanup of these spills.
5419	Gatto	Mike	46	DT3707YnrIQ	540	552	Well, it's just 100 million this year. There's already 27 million in the budget for this. So you can view this as it makes up the 73 million delta this year. That's all it will cost the state this year, but your comments are well taken.
5420	Beall	Jim	92	7Ldg9YBlG9g	198	215	That's an issue. Cause worker's comp is expensive. So, those kinds of issues should be looked at and we should have more information on this. You know, I want to get this into performance management. So that's the bottom line,what I'm seeing here.
5421	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	uaZYquORnnU	1226	1242	and even law enforcement agencies, which were also in strong support of our efforts, and they are currently operating a lot of these take back programs and accepting responsibility for products that manufacturers are refusing to acknowledge really belonged with them.
5422	Steinorth	Marc	35	PZ5qNcZ4hzo	30	51	We're keeping this bill narrow in scope to really look and target the animals that are most at risk of being euthanized in our shelters, and I think people understand that a financial incentive really does make a difference to the buying behaviors. I ask for an aye vote.
5423	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	Fpv-da0xhD8	1428	1445	the PGA granted Sifford full membership on the tour. In 1967 Sifford made history again we he won the greater Hartford open, the first fully sanctioned PGA event ever won by an African-American. He would raise another trophy at the 1969 Los Angeles open.
5424	Harper	Matthew	14	Z5dUcZuiBfw	1847	1870	The reality is this fee directly goes the corporations and not coastal cleanup. You have to decide whether this fits within your conscience as something that you want to be able to support. Your chance is today to eliminate this corporate give away.
5425	Quirk	Bill	23	uxTjtFWEzO4	1501	1529	I also have used the crowd sourcing data. I realized that what data there is nationally underestimates what happens by at least a factor of two, just based on the crowd sourcing data. The same is here in California. The national data would tell you there's 40-60 killings a year, the number is at least twice, maybe three times that. So, we know there are problems. We will work on them. We did listen to you.
5426	Williams	Das	12	QruWeQOWjh0	1876	1894	The quality of education is there. The question is whether that the institution will be able to get into the black. Cuz right now it's requiring a subsidy from every other community college and every other community college student in the state.
5427	Perea	Henry	33	x_nA6Vz0FIc	1038	1058	and it sounds like most of them are pretty small businesses, small shops, throughout the state. I think I heard a couple people testify from Fresno. I worry that if there's the shop owner, it's him, and two people, three people, four people. Do they have the resources? Do they have the time
5428	Wieckowski	Bob	55	QmHhObaXRjg	885	905	and this is a tool for those local folks to go after them. I appreciate your consideration. I'm making myself available to work with each and every one of you on this matter, and we'll take any questions and consider anything beyond the amendments that I'm suggesting that I'm willing to take to make this more palatable to each and every one of you.
5429	Stone	Jeff	26	9wfdC9HGDSQ	825	848	As the years pass, it becomes more and more important to reflect and remember the hatred and evil of that time. History ignored is history that is allowed to repeat itself. Unfortunately, we're witnessing religious extremism, today, claiming thousands of innocent lives in the Middle East and another volatile parts of the world.
5430	Fuller	Jean	49	VyoFcVtTJtQ	281	298	That's what they have to use. So this is that window in between. It's they want to stay in their regular programs and that they want to have as much time to practice during the season as they can with excused absences without having to go on independent studies.
5431	De Leon	Kevin	102	fjQhThyumBs	757	780	Now also on page five, lines 40 through 34 there has to be an economic analysis. An economic analysis that takes into account the impacts on fuel manufacturers, consumer acceptance, the states competitive position with other neighboring states, as well as the cost to consumers. That is page five, lines 30 through 34.
5432	Perea	Henry	33	td32uLu5rbg	1556	1575	Specifically, this bill would allocate no less than 50% of program dollars or $100 million dollars during the period between 2018 and 2023, towards supporting the commercial deployment of zero, and near-zero emission heavy-duty truck technologies that meet or exceed a specific emission standard.
5433	Perea	Henry	33	kQ8roglP29M	353	369	So I think we need to go back and do our homework a little bit more to see how that would work. But I do think it's important to note that the bill says up to $2,500, so I think that does provide for some flexibility as the ARB decides how they will administer the program.
5434	Stone	Mark	20	REI9w9xwFAI	977	997	And some of these are amendments that are important to me. And especially with respect to B, I understand and would like to compliment the CMA and the doctors. The doctors that I've been talking to, who have come a long way in understanding their role with respect to this bill.
5435	Weber	Shirley	44	dv1TuQD9iKk	873	889	That's number one. Even though we talk about drugs, the reality is it's really about race. We can talk in bias and call it anything you wanna call it, but it's really racial. And we have to deal with that because even if we get rid of drugs, there will still be some biases about enforcement, period.
5436	McGuire	Mike	93	GnxGwd8ZNfU	7	29	Subcommittee number three, we are grateful that you would take the time to be with us today. As you know, we are going to be focusing on the issue of CalWORKs today. Really looking forward to one, hearing from all of you and then two, to the discussion that I know the Senators are going to be having today.
5437	Gomez	Jimmy	80	rSN8XCdpbf8	1140	1155	Thank you so much, Mr. Quirk. Any other questions or comments from the Committee Members? First, thank you so much for coming and testifying. We're definitely sorry for your loss and your son's sacrifice. I represent unincorporated East Los Angeles.
5438	Hancock	Loni	98	nYFVQGIL98Y	713	731	And, Senator Beall, I'd like to be a co-author of this bill as well. It is a very important companion bill, you know, I often make, make comparisons of education and corrections because there are so many ways in which they're alike.
5439	Gallagher	James	108	dbbXRXVYxHY	393	404	And they were also presented with a form on how to obtain consent for sex with questions like, "Do you like it when I touch you here?" or "Is it okay to take my pants off?"
5440	Mitchell	Holly	64	LDZM4Nn4wSs	1401	1411	But that why we have proposals for investment that have been brought to us by advocates so they can be heard and a part of the official record. We're gonna open it up to public testimony.
5441	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	qW3ZYP7zbss	1476	1488	And so that when we're going in, we're not underfunding things or not funding it at all and then have it not happen. So I have the same four Cs in that order, so I wanna thank you.
5442	Beall	Jim	92	QRS30WyiTXk	616	645	In return we must properly maintain them because it's cheaper than rebuilding a ruined freeway or street. California now faces a $59 billion back-load in state facilities and deferred maintenance that will grow in absence of a solution. In addition, the $78 billion local government road repair backlog is also added to that 59 billion.
5443	Nielsen	Jim	68	TZ3CNB06_OE	17	38	Madam Chair, members of the committee, I am pleased to bring this bill to you today. I would like to commence with its amendments. First of all, if I would--  To begin with, I'd like to offer some amendments.
5444	Patterson	Jim	119	1WV4YJ98mc4	1555	1597	The request from members was substantially more than that. it was 100 million dollars over five years. I know that's a big number. If there was some interest in bumping the 20 million in the budget, I would be interested in exploring that. And we may want to have, I don't know, a time for some discussion. Time's running out I think, but I at least wanted to bring it up. If there is an interest in pursuing a larger number, I'm glad to have folks make the case. If not, I certainly understand it. But I appreciate the consideration.
5445	Leyva	Connie	62	ZPVP4bYij2U	43	63	SB 334 is about making sure that our children will have access to clean, safe drinking water at school. This bill will ensure that water is adequately provided on school campuses and it's safe to consume. There's currently no requirement in state law to test drinking water at school sites for lead or any other contaminants.
5446	Melendez	Melissa	41	seV-S-c1PNk	925	944	Ok, so I don't know if you have the statistics on a nationwide level, but being that they're not allowed to do lane splitting in all of these other states, do forty nine other states have, numbers wise, more motorcycle accidents than California?
5447	Wagner	Donald	88	0LdXFnPqPCk	2411	2433	All motions continued. Seeing and hearing no further business I'm ready to entertain a motion to adjourn. Mr. Holden moves and Ms. Olsen seconds that this house stands adjourned until Monday March the 16th at 12 PM. Quorum call is lifted.
5448	Gipson	Mike	28	Smx7pNnpEJQ	1873	1885	So, is there a need for this law? Absolutely. Government Code 1090 must be applicable. And if you choose to sit on the governing board, you don't get to funnel those tax dollars into your pocket, you should be subject for criminal prosecution.
5449	Bigelow	Frank	91	99kPN2IqWBc	217	238	Also we will have conclude with Mr. Joe, Jack Gibbon representing Unite Here AFL, CIO. We also have Miss Kathy Chrisgen, representing the tribe as well to answer any questions. I hope that you'll find today's hearing very informative, and will be able to support AB475 when it comes before you.
5450	Weber	Shirley	44	4lx0MqjDD6Q	2052	2083	But yet, they were people who were trying to destroy the country, which is a lot different than maybe a person who signs an order or who participates in some activity but still believes in the union itself. In any other place in the world they would be seen as traitors as they should be seen here. We would not, hopefully, name a school after Benedict Arnold, because we believe he was a traitor, and he doesn't have, in our minds, a right to have anything named after him that would be a symbol of excellence for our children and our families to participate in and to recognize.
5451	Leno	Mark	60	hSwKpjUIVVQ	1175	1200	I'm glad we all stand together on that. We have a compromise on page 24 and this deals with the veterans claims backlog and I think we're all in agreement on this. I'm going to ask Department of Finance to walk us through the compromise.
5452	Dodd	Bill	71	mgHzB-qdttI	1104	1120	What I'm not interesting in is undermining the anesthesiologist.The nurse,Certified nurse and Anesthesiologist industry from the standpoint is they are providing a service now. It is working. Why is this necessary to put on ?
5453	Nielsen	Jim	68	4eIdwcDuXeo	1711	1728	Has the Treasurer been engaged in this at all, or they just benign until such time as you submit something to the Treasurer? You have no cause to know what's going on in the Treasurer's mind, but does anybody even have a clue?
5454	Bonilla	Susan	3	1AD-QUnKZQc	1117	1136	By requiring the disclosure of these contracts, all parties in the deposition will be informed of the potential lack of impartiality and will be alerted that they might also want to seek comparable trial services. Another issue with these ongoing contracts is cost shifting. Court reporting firms offer low prices for
5455	Monning	Bill	25	_BbXW7wLano	561	580	of Cal Poly's most exceptional students who have achieved excellence in academics in disciplines that range from engineering and agriculture to the liberal arts. Many of these students have been recognized at the state and national level for their accomplishments, including some students who've
5456	Pavley	Fran	104	UOAgtw9idpM	1373	1394	Those of you who have been on this Committee awhile may have heard this subject before. But every time a water well is drilled, the drillers require by law to provide the Department of Water Resources a well completion report with the State of California for each well dril,l that's existing law.
5457	Bonilla	Susan	3	Y6AL-ziJQBc	633	643	Well, and as I understand, there is a problem, though, of people trying to get in, like there's not enough capacity to test everyone who wants to be tested. Is that true?
5458	De Leon	Kevin	102	A1UTGLmNv2E	773	802	The civil war to become the vice minister of foreign affairs, but especially for Salvadorians outside of El Salvador. Colleagues, please stand and give a rounding welcome to the vice minister of foreign affairs of El Salvador. The honorable, Castaneda Magaa.
5459	Bloom	Richard	2	1WV4YJ98mc4	1832	1851	And that's a pretty big job, particularly for those who serve on this committee, and so I want to thank each of the subcommittee members for all the time that you put in, reading materials, considering the issues, and then here in the committee room considering and voting on issues.
5460	Pavley	Fran	104	iupDRc3kcPY	982	994	I know that most of the prop one expenditures are for part or 50% or so of the total outcome, so maybe there's a way to make sure that programs are rolling out.
5461	Wolk	Lois	94	k-1hI-qnp7U	214	232	we know that over the last decade there has been a serious problem in financing just the most basics of our communities. The one positive thing I think, is compared to water issues which you know that I spend a great deal of time on.
5462	Weber	Shirley	44	7bdBeI04iMY	1387	1404	that its happening only to those who are old versus those who are young or vice versa how do we know that it's only happening on certain stretches of road if we don't have the data. How do we begin to address is very critical problem if we don't have the data. Some assume that the data is going to prove the certain people wrong it may prove that certain people are
5463	Weber	Shirley	44	7bdBeI04iMY	1404	1422	right, that there have been searches and people have followed protocol but we must have the data. This is the minimum we can do for the people of California all of us have been confronted over the last year with the challenges we face in this nation being a person of color and these challenges have existed
5464	Bonta	Rob	85	oZrbKv34-B8	1366	1383	And unbeknownst to the patient, an out of network provider participates in their care. Almost everyone has experienced, heard of or knows someone who has experienced a surprise bill. These bills range from hundreds to up to tens of thousands of dollars and are pushing some consumers into bankruptcy.
5465	Nielsen	Jim	68	rD0VjcELenc	1385	1406	I remember him handing over the keys to the tractor when one of our neighbors finally got back several years later. There were others who took advantage of those who were dislocated, but most came back, were well received and supported by their neighbors, became the bedrock of our California heritage that same bedrock they were on this very unfortunate decision came to visit upon them.
5466	Pan	Richard	96	SHuB-iUXJvo	862	873	There's been substantial evidence that reveals that prime healthcare services are transferring patients who are admitted to the emergency room for acute alcohol poisoning to police departments, correction facilities and county jails by calling 911.
5467	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	8ENPCPUYlKU	725	736	The bill also requires the state bar to comply with theBagley-Keene Open Meeting Act as well as the California Public Records Act. I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
5468	Leno	Mark	60	Jy18DQ2_OCI	394	418	And we will go back to page 12. Their motion was for the Senate version and we have three-zero, three-zero on page 12 as well as on page 13. Page 14. Aid Family Leave Outreach. This was the Assembly's proposal.
5469	Nguyen	Janet	65	uprCp-AfCts	2215	2233	They will get, no.The federal- well, the college is not giving them, it's the federal government who's giving them the relief of their federal loans. So the students are getting the federal loans forgiveness by the federal government, but that is still a tax is they choose to take that.
5470	De Leon	Kevin	102	DaiegGG5yrM	898	917	Now, back in 2006, when we moved forward with the climate warming, the Global Warming Solutions Act, many folks who testified at this table here today said that, I, A, it was unrealistic, B, it was naive to set certain targets. In fact, this would wreck the economy.
5471	Block	Marty	59	6FS_MTpGrZk	1235	1282	With that I would like to think this panel excuse you from this particular discussion and some of you may be back in the next series of panels. Now, all invite up with a very different perspective our panel of industry representatives Dan Gwaltney, the President's California financial services providers. Javo Cobert, Senior Vice President for Governor relations check into cash, Carol Stewart Senior Vice President advance America, and Robert Greesors, Senior Vice President government affairs community choice financial.
5472	Mitchell	Holly	64	V8GPRDBjfho	309	326	Compliments are always acceptable. We're almost there. I'm always troubled that public testimony is at the end, but I think it's critical to give you an opportunity hear all of the panel presentations that you can respond to.
5473	Mitchell	Holly	64	L1wK14HX9JQ	1415	1428	Excellent. Take the last point I'd make in the EBTPs, I think we were in the middle of budget subcommittee hearing process when there was technological snafu, as we've all experienced with our own banks, whatever.
5474	Bonta	Rob	85	tf_1MHXwKaY	324	339	which has asked that MediCal rates be raised to Medicare rates. One-third of our Californians are on MediCal. And we're asking that they receive Medicare reimbursement rates. So, with that in mind and with that as a foundation, we think it is not inappropriate to
5475	Hadley	David	40	gT2_z9UGrSs	1405	1429	I can tell you that every parent and every student in the cities of the South Bay who went through that experience are glad that their predecessors, their community leaders, 70 years ago, over 100 years ago took control of their schools for the benefit of their communities and their students. And I believe that's what local control is all about. And I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
5476	Thurmond	Tony	4	MmJWVCHB8vo	103	123	Thank you Dr. Flores and Director Kent, not bad for two weeks. We invite you to stay with us, I know some of you have time commitments. But we want to move into the segment of our conversation that focuses on our travel for needs and there may be some overlaps, And then afterwards the members may have questions for everyone.
5477	Hill	Jerry	66	7p8pDq5czTo	675	721	And the opposition also stated that this would create tension, animosity, within the district. Well, my concern and what I witnessed, is that's the exact reason for doing this bill, and for this legislation is that it would prevent the tension and the animosity because once there's a public opportunity to speak, which is transparency and public comment, is something that we strive for in state and local governments, that when they have that opportunity to see where the district is planning to work with the charter school, to locate the school, they can comment, they can have input into that, and this district and the charter school can take that into consideration before that final agreement is conducted and is completed.
5478	Hancock	Loni	98	dv1TuQD9iKk	1385	1402	Assemblyman Quirk and I will be here, and we're gonna take notes and listen, and we wanna hear what people have to tell us, so thank you all so much. Many of you have been here all day, and we appreciate your participation.
5479	Chiu	David	7	FA0o_dng1YE	1405	1425	Thank you Mr. Chair. First of all I want to thank the author for moving forward this very important topic. Before I became an elected official I spent nine years as a founder and a chief operating officer of a small business and I can certainly attest as can hundreds of thousands of small business around the state how incredibly difficult current access to capital is.
5480	Brown	Cheryl	13	hECme4j8edc	159	184	Did I say it right? Middle College I knew I would say it wrong. From Middle College. The reason that I'm happy. The reason that I'm happy to welcome them one is because it's my granddaughters class. That's number one, and number two I think we have to include. young people in this discussion.
5481	Nielsen	Jim	68	Q9Mn4k8Lves	541	550	But the agency does need to change how it does business. This is a signal in that direction that we are going to act in California, for our community colleges.
5482	Mitchell	Holly	64	0wls8HR1alY	1356	1372	So I just think it's a matter of making sure, you know we have a responsibility also as policy-makers  to try to get this information back into our districts to make sure that all of the moving parts that are working with the same population with the same general goal are plugged into these opportunities. Thank you.
5483	Gomez	Jimmy	80	2D0v6cuDbfE	1644	1661	Both in support of this bill cuz my approach was never to vilify anybody but really to try to solve a problem. A pragmatic solution to part of this problem. So, I think this bill is a step in the right direction but we still have a lot more work to do and I ask for your aye vote.
5484	Chavez	Rocky	83	dpByeg5zAi8	1120	1134	But I can tell you this. I never met a teacher who did not care about me and want me to be successful. In fact, if I'd have listened to all my teachers who'd tell me to do things, I'd probably gotten much farther than I am today.
5485	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	mgO95LX_sqE	1498	1512	Very briefly, the bill does also encourage that regionalism, couldn't agree more. Nature doesn't stop at a city or county line, and look forward to continuing the work that we're doing. And appreciate that this is an issue that we have to address. And appreciate your support in asking for an aye vote.
5486	Williams	Das	12	cr1U1amFOTo	278	302	Additionally, the cost of renewable energy has fallen since California adopted its 33% target. In fact, retail rates vary only slightly between those states leading in renewable purchases and those states that don't aggressively pursue renewables. Yet the positive momentum of this program will plateau in 2020. And most of California's utilities are unlikely to comply ahead of schedule.
5487	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	0MzTgkt-Llc	10	29	Thank you madame President and colleagues. This is a technical bill that updates a number of the health and safety code provisions regarding the management of hazardous waste that certified, unified program agencies, otherwise belovedly known as CUPA's, are charged with overseeing.
5488	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	R2eb9EMkWP0	1354	1376	Thank you very much. Witnesses in opposition? All right, and again this is with the amendments that have been taken. So if you're still in opposition, please go ahead and proceed.
5489	Bloom	Richard	2	t0rNuwc0CtA	628	652	But, it also might be helpful and maybe you can weigh in on this also, if we're going to engage an outside consultant to utilize the services that the consultant to help identify with more specificity, where the priorities base, since this is such a large complex organization.
5490	Weber	Shirley	44	iylj0sWv7JI	756	781	I think many of us remember of the last two years when we though we had done a yeoman's job in basically not allowing the CSUs to increase fees, I mean to abrasively increase tuition, to only discover that many campuses had different fees that they themselves had imposed without the students actually approving those fees; some kind of consultation process or talking to a few students, they decided to increase fees.
5491	Weber	Shirley	44	iylj0sWv7JI	781	822	I know I went to a supposedly happy event on my campus on San Diego State to only discover that those of us who are legislators are being protested against because the student fees had just been raised again for the second or third time. We also discovered that some campuses had fees as higher as $2000 dollars, I think it is San Jose State. When I went to another meeting for something else, I was informed of that. So we realized that while we are holding tuition down, campuses were using whatever standard they chose to basically increase the so called "student success fees" without the students knowing what the success was going to be, what were the fees, how long they were going to last, and obviously increasing fees at different campuses for various reasons.
5492	Lara	Ricardo	107	i7abTEXGU1E	1925	1946	And I think that's the issue when we talk about putting these longer timeframes, the technology's moving so quickly now that we wanna make sure we get not only the best bang for our buck. And which means that we're doing the most to capture and reduce our carbon footprint, but also understanding, like what you said, the ability for
5493	Lara	Ricardo	107	i7abTEXGU1E	1987	2001	also look at the broader goals of GGRF, and what the administration, Assembly, and Senate leadership are gonna agree on in terms of how we're gonna spend these monies. So again, members, thank you, and with that we'll move this item to suspense file.
5494	Lara	Ricardo	107	k4GcCA0Jbo4	1364	1374	Thank you. I wanna urge, again, the cu, the witnesses to stick to the fiscal policy. The fiscal issues on the measure. We already had policy discussions. Go ahead, Ms. Capell.
5495	Baker	Catharine	74	qCEr8jDp5Hg	942	959	I'm pleased to present you today AB1041, a bill that will help make education more affordable for low and middle income families in California. This bill increases the tax benefits for Coverdell education savings accounts, or ESAs, on the state level as a meaningful complement to what already is practiced at the federal level.
5496	Stone	Mark	20	DgVvXUz7n-U	1177	1204	Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members we are at a point in history right now as we make this decision. This notion is coming to California and it's our process or it's the ballot process that will decide it. And if you look at how this bill has been crafted. It has been very, very carefully crafted to take into account all the perspectives we have been hearing on the floor today.
5497	Stone	Mark	20	DgVvXUz7n-U	1210	1225	It is not a bill that would allow for coercion. It is not a bill that would allow for someone else making a decision. About someone's personal decision about their own death. That's what's paramount about this bill.
5498	McGuire	Mike	93	519YUTER2IM	1430	1451	I bring that up because I want to make sure, after the millions that have been invested to be able to build the Lodi Energy Center that, and since it's gold standard, the legislation is not gonna impact, in particular, the energy center with the new standards that have been brought forward.
5499	Hertzberg	Robert	99	ch_qINsbUNA	1120	1134	But let me ask you, doesn't this information become public anyway? I mean this is really what we're talking about, is a convenience matter. It's not as if we're disclosing something on your tax return or whatever. It's a question of when it gets disclosed cause I couldn't agree with you more.
5500	Weber	Shirley	44	kIKVbsrTmqg	996	1012	And that's not to shift the responsibility to you. What I'm saying is that there continues to be a pot of money. And you know this is an issue that's important to me. It's an issue important to many. All the things we're talking about in funding is not $2.5 billion.
5501	McGuire	Mike	93	MpQ4SGzO7GE	1867	1884	There has never been a data breach when it comes to a local county tax collector in this state. So, it's confidential and if you are a host, you're already providing your private data on a 1099 to the IRS.
5502	Hernandez	Roger	37	r1PhXBRe6ug	1023	1096	Also with us here today, our newly-elected Kevin Michael Carrizosa Tribal Councilman, and Gabriel TeSam Jr., and also Sam Brown the Tribal Treasurer.  Please join me in giving them a very warm Assembly welcome.
5503	Hernandez	Roger	37	r1PhXBRe6ug	1002	1023	Visiting us here today are members of our diverse community here are the tribal council members and Chairman of the Viejas Band of Kumeyaay Indians. They are visiting us here from San Diego County.  With us here today is the Chairman of the Viejas Tribe Robert J. Welch, Jr., Viejas Tribal Government Vice Chair Victor E. Woods.
5504	Garcia	Cristina	112	Y0xkoNoudD0	453	470	However, as recently as 1970, women's history was virtually an unknown topic. In 1977 that began to change, and with so many good things it started with strong California women. The Sonoma County Commission on the status of women initiated the first women's history week.
5505	McCarty	Kevin	22	ZHlQISHQoPg	1430	1446	I know I've talked to my colleagues on the city council, Mr. Chu and Ms. Campos from San Jose, and they say they haven't see any of that. They said reports have came back the opposite. So I don't know if you can honestly say that it will have that detrimental effect.
5506	Liu	Carol	63	gN6B3iXXHo0	598	627	The bill also gives public and non profit entities a priority over affordable housing entities to purchase an historical home. Public entities could rehabilitate and sell the house for a profit and apply the funds to build affordable housing in the same area. Alternatively the public entity or nonprofit would restore and open the historical home for public use. Mr. Chair, members resolution of this issue has been a long time coming.
5507	Hancock	Loni	98	qg64LVJvp3Q	1226	1253	That looked like what that amendment that I read, said. So, I'm interested frankly in... I'm not disputing the desirability of having kids immunized. Whether this is actually the best way to build a community consensus around it.
5508	Chau	Ed	116	QoWDHxezaEY	1023	1049	Now, I think the opposition also mentioned something about damage to the computer in the oppositional letter. Let me just reiterate the fact that if the service is done with permission, whether it is penetration test or otherwise, that service is absolutely legal, because it has authority, it has permission from, let's say from the owner of the computer system, and that is within the purview of existing law.
5509	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	ZM99l_dNJfs	1052	1063	And the-- it can be a little tedious. So, I don't know that I've seen the ballot from your county but I think it's a little different. Do you have one where you can fill in next to the name?
5510	Gallagher	James	108	7KrRcZ9ORsY	1038	1050	The second one is they wanted them to state the fact that the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene encourage potentially pregnant women to consult with a licensed provider and the third.
5511	Nielsen	Jim	68	NAcngTShkgg	1321	1350	I'd like you to consider that, the Administration to consider that trigger mechanism. We could put that into effect, that'd give you an assurance that if there's revenue. That is to the premise and we just don't need the tax. We don't need to put impacts on increases in premiums but we're doing good budgeting were using money that we actually know were going to have and that short of a tax increase you see. Would you make a consideration of that?
5512	Weber	Shirley	44	KRvT4-vnFFc	233	251	Yes, I understand that the concern and we will handle as a council working on this to make sure that it meets the specifications of the bond and those kinds of things. And so we think this is a better way of really detailing where the resources are gonna go, just rather than some big broad category.
5513	Stone	Jeff	26	xvNlOWm4ksM	1182	1192	And when you're talking about this kind of money, I hope that it's through the RFP process, we look at their track record and their financial wherewithal and their ability to continue to provide the support that's needed.
5514	Block	Marty	59	4INVuEQu1gA	412	432	So in conclusion, SB 538 ensures that patients seeking primary care from naturopathic doctors can receive appropriate care without the added time, cost, and health risk of finding another physician for a routine prescription or procedure. It keeps patients out of costly emergency rooms and helps California reduce the primary care shortage.
5515	Cooley	Ken	45	xhI7BgS1JK0	2073	2092	Yeah, I just wanted to jump in on this, I sort of understand what you're trying to do, I actually think that for your purposes here in California to amend these code sections almost create problems, a stand alone rule, that stated just what you wanted to achieve would be better in a sense.
5516	Hancock	Loni	98	y0sIqVkPves	1315	1334	Right. Okay. Thank you. I have one other very basic question. i'm never a 10% clear if when we talk about long-term care we're talking about institutionalized of some kind in a nursing home or if we're talking about in-home services as well.
5517	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	hnhklV-igrA	764	781	So, these were serious, serious problems and there has, I don't believe been a case yet that says, that the state's right to pretend responsibility actually, to protect public safety and health is subjugated to the right of the individual.
5518	Hernandez	Ed	103	UvkHUCZkG9I	1174	1191	For Senate Health, we have 3 bills left. We are going to move on to item number 2, SB 118 Liu, School-Based Health and Education Partnership Program. Senator Liu welcome.
5519	Gatto	Mike	46	oIrgXGq-Z_I	711	722	All this does is it limits those televisions from recording those private conversations and sending them to a third party for a use that is not intended by the user. I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
5520	Leno	Mark	60	By4bB8yg798	492	518	Great. Anyone have any questions for Mr. Taylor? We thank you very much for joining us today. And that does conclude our business so you cast three votes already. Your meeting is adjourned and we're going to lift the calls on each of the three motions today so members who were not here originally can add on. Otherwise, I thank everyone for attending.
5521	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	nJXs6pD2ors	28	43	And we have been working very closely with the Chamber of Commerce and the Civil Justice Association of California, who I believe, at this point, we have come to an agreement of just knocking out those last few little items.
5522	Bloom	Richard	2	MO4QFekCxFk	1900	1921	Beyond those maximums that are recommended by our own governments. You've heard that this measure is unfair. Well what's unfair is that our young people are being subjected to a barrage of advertising and other marketing strategies.
5523	Stone	Jeff	26	ED30zf7wAe8	1143	1161	And I think that you're on track and the goal was to have at least 2,000 crisis beds statewide, which is a good goal, unfortunately it probably doesn't satisfy the need, but at least we're attacking the problem and you have basically 866 beds that have been funded.
5524	Pan	Richard	96	qg64LVJvp3Q	1003	1025	Protection is about ensuring that we have localities, including schools, and so that's where our children gather. We also have staff, and while certainly, we're concerned about people being at risk in other parts of the community, we have a policy set, that the best place to get immunization rates high and to catch that is actually in entry to schools.
5525	Nguyen	Janet	65	BifOW5Vhe4Q	458	469	Under SB 353, counties will have additional funds to address these issues. The funds are flexible, allowing each county to address the public safety needs most critical to its residents.
5526	Garcia	Cristina	112	v8nsxSPxdAk	241	254	Yeah, it felt like sometimes. Okay. It was a long call but it speaks to the fact that you were trying to find that middle spot where pragmatic with the reality that we're living in, find an interim responsible solution here and we move forward.
5527	Mitchell	Holly	64	hlpilfylTQI	1334	1344	Primarily because it seems premature to fully remove the requirement that all such facilities be eligible for federal funding. Given the fact that the department is continuing to have conversations with CMS.
5528	Leno	Mark	60	Iras-GLDTWk	869	892	As the analysis points out, there is concern from the Board of Equalization. We've been working with them, and we have presented amendments to the committee today that allows the BOE to change a, charge a separate one-time fee tobacco retailers selling e-cigarettes, and this special fee will remain only until e-cigarettes would be taxed as other tobacco products.
5529	Hernandez	Ed	103	8vnz5G2is0o	148	177	What we are going to do is we are going to ask each side those that are in support, and those that are in opposition, and you can have as many individuals come up, there will be a half hour for each the proponent and the opponent. Then there will be time for members to ask questions. And then I understand that there will be quite a few people who would like to come up and testify in public comment. I believe a half hour is plenty to get all of the arguments in.
5530	Block	Marty	59	7YJsJzsFEpM	764	782	Electronically delivered threats, especially those sent via social media, have added a layer of complexity in prosecuting these cases. Current law requires that a threat be directed at committing a crime against a specific person, putting that person in sustained fear.
5531	Quirk	Bill	23	CRMwg6_WO3E	1497	1522	There are, however, other approaches, approaches which we haven't tried. For example, sharing renewables on a regional basis so that we would use Wyoming wind which is very complimentary to us, that we'd use New Mexico and Arizona solar which then could meet our morning peak.
5532	Chavez	Rocky	83	MO4QFekCxFk	1200	1215	I think this is a, everything I've read about changing behavior is that the best way to change behavior is to change the environment and we are talking, and a lot of us have talked about access to water.
5533	Mitchell	Holly	64	2MXVIex_Zeg	2060	2075	Thank you. And I want the rest of the folks to understand that this was kind of our first kind of hearing from the perspective of children, and EPSDT is for children. So I want everyone else in line to think you're going to get that kind of liberal treatment.
5534	Anderson	Joel	57	hnhklV-igrA	1821	1852	So when we're looking at all of the vaccinations, many are created with aborted fetal cells. As a practicing catholic and other practicing catholics, we can't participate in that. Are there...on all these vaccinations, are there alternatives that are not created from aborted fetal cells?
5535	Wieckowski	Bob	55	ImdbglqlDDQ	1919	1945	And as we've pointed out in the analysis The South Bay Odor Stakeholders Group, I think as the industry has indicated, has won. And so have you Assembly Member, in providing a forum for industry and for members of the public to come. We're here today talking about the concerns that people have in the community and moving to resolve those odor issues in the South San Francisco Bay.
5536	Nielsen	Jim	68	oi__bTDc1c4	982	1004	I don't have any printed, no. And in this respect, I'll complain a little bit about the lack of simple time to analyze. We have had some, and I appreciate that. It's better than usually. But it hasn't been enough time really to prepare and proffer amendments, to analyze amendments, to consider amendments.
5537	Block	Marty	59	uz1blTsZnws	587	598	Noted. All but three items are now completed on part A, we will move to part B after a ten minute recess. We'll be back here at 3:40, 3:40.
5538	Campos	Nora	76	D1U0Ojzunqk	1790	1809	The ones, when we talk about medical marijuana, the ones that really need the medicine to be healthy and be able to function. And I have yet to see that. Even though we continue to move forward with this policy. So I just wanted to echo what the Chair had said because I think she brought up some excellent points.
5539	Monning	Bill	25	9Ksuo-8qRMo	808	833	And so, the balance, ideally, people are trained in advance, but if it's your relative who's on the ground, who might be saved by somebody having access to the machine, if one life is saved by somebody who wasn't trained in CPR, I come down on that side of the lifesaving potential.
5540	Gallagher	James	108	1wxe7O9piQI	1869	1896	So, does the public have the right to know everybody on their block is going to church exercising their first amendment right? You know, I think that, you know, this is a much needed bill to protect the privacy interest of people who are just exercising their fundamental rights under the constitution, so I'm going to support the bill today. I just wanted to see if there was any response to that issue with regard to what State Sheriffs brought up.
5541	Bates	Pat	58	1JV-wI6cFUY	1346	1364	We actually had two sites selected, but because of the other issue, and it goes to us Senator Galgiani was saying, there's a concern about law enforcement, and is it going to be present, and is it going to be able to use the tools to address the criminal element that hides among the homeless.
5542	Grove	Shannon	77	2cybSlRCgP0	1449	1464	So we had a guy that was severely behavioral. He didn't have a lot of medical issues, but he was irate and violent and there were serious things. And they had to restrain him hundreds of times in a week and tie him down to the bed.
5543	McGuire	Mike	93	3cRtgxQLQsI	1481	1501	Believe this is a very reasonable piece of legislation that focuses on local control, and I'd like to be able to talk very quickly about the platforms. So, you have Airbnb's platform where you pay directly. They can absolutely collect and do appreciate the work that they've been doing with some of the cities they can collect.
5544	Perea	Henry	33	Gv0uyUPdJmA	106	118	And we just respectfully ask for your aye vote. There's no known opposition. Industry wants it, supported by both the food processors, as well as the CalChamber. Thank you.
5545	Monning	Bill	25	oC8-KbPE6Yo	1321	1335	Yeah just briefly. Just to comment on that. There's been preliminary evaluation of the first program. The second program would consider other grant applications. They wouldn't necessarily be based on the performance of the first grant. They would be independently evaluated.
5546	McGuire	Mike	93	qTf-RqJKEFo	1758	1765	Madam Chair, I'm grateful for this opportunity. Thank you for being a coauthor and I look forward to working with all of you, and thanks so much Senator, as well.
5547	Leno	Mark	60	SdYdT8y72Ng	962	983	Right. Is this also the issue that you're trying to address here, one of those situations I know it is one time money, but an attempt to address the fact that when we set a threshold, there will be some that don't quite meet it, and an argument can be made that's not fair.
5548	Hernandez	Roger	37	tJoPe6FpmUg	1121	1140	Thank you very much. Next witness. Anyone wishing to add on in opposition? Okay, hearing and seeing none. At this time, we're gonna put it in the hands of the committee. Committee members, any questions or comments? Vice Chair Harper.
5549	Irwin	Jacqui	16	14lq834z9Pc	1698	1709	Here with me today to testify in support of the bill is Barbara Baran, Co-Director of the California EDGE Coalition, and Jessie Ryan, Executive Vice President of The Campaign for College Opportunity.
5550	Daly	Tom	118	NEf6zh-NPIY	1853	1879	Thank you, Mr. Dababneh. On that point, I want to remind folks that in last year's budget we increased the amount of money spent on marketing and communication to workers, so that they could be aware of the program. I expect in this year's budget there will be a proposal for a three-year commitment to increase that amount of money.
5551	Leno	Mark	60	LNCt_q34OxY	115	132	And so you're here to say and I know you're not speaking for all business interests, but I had presumed that most of these business associations that are listed in opposition, given that this was highlighted, had that concern more about the administrative record than Section 6. It's really about Section 6?
5552	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	FigUfqszD1E	1118	1135	I'll just make a quick comment Mr. Chair. I appreciate the, the entire panel for the information you brought here today and the effort. Any effort you can make to spread it across the capitol, can only help our cause. Because a lot of people come up here and transportation to them is moving people.
5553	Grove	Shannon	77	JfU4ybXUoBc	125	143	But I submit to you that it's been rightly interpreted. And if the legislative body choose to change this to make abortions an essential service, then pass that law, don't let unelected bureaucrats that don't, aren't accountable to the people that we represent make decisions for us, when the intent of the law has been in place for 40 years.
5554	Fuller	Jean	49	52URYfZsNNs	770	787	I have a few guests with me who will speak to the level of athleticism and dedication and I'm going to start out by-- I'll let you two introduce yourselves and when we'll come back and introduce the others.
5555	Mitchell	Holly	64	C_H3N21mnys	1034	1050	But at the top you say the case study for San Diego, $64.00 is the 2009 daily market rate for childcare, but that's not adjusted to the percent that we pay. So, even though that might be what the retail market rate says, the state doesn't pay that.
5556	Leno	Mark	60	SQEMna8rhH0	386	402	Thank you Mr. Lopez, and we appreciate your taking time to come and share your personal story with us, because that's what is most important. How legislation that we deal with here impacts the lives of Californians, so thank you.
5557	Stone	Jeff	26	8mKwfh1zVig	1905	1926	So, just let me give you an example, it goes back to my profession. And I was a, I've been a pharmacist now for 34 years now, it's hard to believe, and a new company came out. It was an HMO. It was called Pacific Care. Right? I was a Pacific Care provider, but what Pacific Care did was they said, do you know what?
5558	Medina	Jose	81	Uoe2v6pAgNg	2483	2499	Any witnesses in opposition? Seeing none, do I have a motion? A motion by Mr. Levine second by Miss Weber. The motion is due pass to the Health Committee. Madame Secretary, please call the role.
5559	Baker	Catharine	74	gCJqYiGvi7w	700	717	And I appreciate that just what, I'll make it quick Mr. Chairman. The final area that perhaps can be addressed, if not, in the bill and certainly in the conversations we're having is goes actually to the, in the criminal aspect, in the search and seizure rules that we have, a constitutional rules when you hand over your
5560	Dababneh	Matthew	50	gCJqYiGvi7w	688	700	We're really excited about the prospect of having not only a more convenient form of ID to supplement a physical driver's license, not replaced at this point. But also, we're looking at making sure it's safe and secure.
5561	Thurmond	Tony	4	oTbSGNJwWWA	690	707	I wanna hear an evaluation of how well that new service is meeting their need. Just because I don't want it to be the case that we save a little bit of money by moving somebody into a service that does not meet their particular need. So I'm gonna give you a chance to get together on your numbers and look forward to hearing from you again.
5562	Gaines	Ted	24	zqM_Vy0kspE	2188	2210	So, I'm fearful that, and concerned that, as we continue to move the ball forward on efficiency from a fuel consumption standpoint that the auto manufacturer is having to adjust the type of oil that's going into these, and you may not be getting the 10,000 miles that you thought you were going to get.
5563	Obernolte	Jay	86	z_nb3rZYxjo	151	166	Okay, well, I've registered my concern. As I said, I have no problem with with accelerating the process for builders who choose to incorporate dual plumbing in their houses, but I'm concerned that could be used as a tool to require dual plumbing, and I have a much bigger concern with that. Thank you.
5564	Cooper	Jim	21	C3fC_QKuL0U	208	224	Police brutality incidents do not happen in a vacuum. Being an African American male, I know that they occur, because of a variety of factors, often socioeconomic conditions. I think the legislature's role should be to help communities lift themselves out of poverty which in turn will lower crime rates.
5565	Wood	Jim	72	MO4QFekCxFk	541	563	It's not necessarily a cavity, but it is, is the beginning of that. And those who consumed more soft drinks and more fruit juices had higher erosion which, which kind of made sense in, in, intuitively. I practiced dentistry for 27 years. I can tell you that I could spot a kid who drank lots of soft drinks in a heartbeat.
5566	Lara	Ricardo	107	hqvUVHybZBI	44	62	Sergeants, would you please call the absent committee members and the following authors who are presenting bills so we can get started? We will work hard to finish before our floor session at noon. That's authors presenting bills as due pass. Assemblymembers Cooley, Brown, Jones, Santiago, Hernandez was here.
5567	Bonilla	Susan	3	hb1VvxrKGQE	426	450	It's because when we did our local control funding formula and did away with categoricals, we also did away with the funding for these programs. We believe that the revenue generated would be put to good use in our particularly middle schools, high schools dealing with the issues of being bullied and harassment along with just general violence prevention and school safety plans.
5568	Pavley	Fran	104	_NTagRCFfsc	2154	2170	Some period of time, just for the sake of review and evaluation, otherwise they would never come off the books. We would never prioritize what's relevant in the 21st century, compared to I don't wanna sound like Mr. Morelock, but.
5569	Liu	Carol	63	9xlCmdTyLME	1567	1589	Serving inmates in the community represents a cost savings for the state. ACP is a successful and thoughtfully designed program with a particular focus on rehabilitation and family reunification. It serves as a model for the state's enhanced alternative custody program as well as alternative custody programs implemented at the county level.
5570	Beall	Jim	92	SBp6YDSI70I	1467	1491	Mom's in her 80s, and she drives maybe once or twice a week. She probably puts on, I don't know if she puts 1,000 miles on her car. She's very proud she's able to drive, but she drives to church. She drives to the store. Once in a while, some other trips with the family. Of course she has a battalion of members of the family, because she
5571	Kim	Young	82	g07XaAgsb-U	1653	1669	So continuing on, I know we'll have more hearings and I look forward to working with everyone here and especially with my colleagues on this committee to make Golden State doesn't lose her luster and can do more to shine. Thank you so much.
5572	Hernandez	Ed	103	71cBx2pj13o	335	347	Okay, all right. No other questions, from any of the members? Anyway, I want to thank you for the presentation, I appreciate it very much, we'll move onto the next section.
5573	De Leon	Kevin	102	wxAms1gWFJA	1251	1270	By working with these subregional Council of Governments, COGs, to identify worthy projects, LA Metro is pursuing a bottoms-ups approach that will result in ordnance that reflects the need-- transportation needs of each area of the county. Allowing LA County to explore this option will allow the region to determine its own future.
5574	Gipson	Mike	28	yegxkcxS3po	265	290	So, I have a audit request before the body that I'll be presenting for their consideration, and I would do the same thing by deferring it to July 2015 to start the audit request. I've had conversation with the State Auditor around this particular issue, and so that's what I'll be asking for today.
5575	Thurmond	Tony	4	YGvsvPIzjxQ	900	916	And then they do it with young men and young women, and wanted to know if there would be a way to bring in those groups that have the expertise to lead the conversations and for student groups. Like the young people that we heard from today, and thank you for your testimony, and your advocacy.
5576	Chavez	Rocky	83	l9VB53WlnQ0	18	39	I'm thinkin', you know to do a program, to get it up and going, is probably a year in itself. And we're piecemealing this whole thing, and it seems to me that... You know we're not gonna see a lot of results. And the answer that I got back to me was "It takes us to the end of the governor's term, so that's it."
5577	Hernandez	Roger	37	hqvUVHybZBI	568	583	Currently, the California Department of Education establishes an indirect cost rate, to cover program and administrative expenses. Despite this established rate, rules associated with many grants and allocations limit the ability of school districts to cover actual operating costs.
5578	Medina	Jose	81	doK9qPE6aWU	697	716	And if I could follow up, Professor Samuels, what is your feeling on how effective the rebenching, you indicated that it's only $37 million, 3%. How effective do you think this rebenching is gonna be in addressing the disparities between campuses?
5579	Hernandez	Roger	37	mRtWZWKaAFE	20	29	Are, are they at one location, and when they show up to work, and how does it work for them? Or, or are they, can they also be on and off, a taxi driver?
5580	Huff	Bob	105	9xlCmdTyLME	814	823	Seaport infrastructure financing districts are an important step to recognizing and allowing seaports to grow operate in a manner that best fits each individual one. I recommend an aye vote.
5581	Pan	Richard	96	LYOrqHadQ70	397	416	But this really is about protecting the public health. We need to be sure that all children who attend our public schools, including children who cannot get vaccinated, in fact, the ones who get the medical exemptions are gonna get, potentially be exposed to vaccine-preventable illnesses. And that's really what this is about.
5582	Leyva	Connie	62	OaKXojP7k_0	647	666	that is largely unregulated there's nothing in current law that says that state employees can not be reimbursed so why do we need to put in law we're specifically talking about ...in lift what if we put into law that state employees easy
5583	Bonta	Rob	85	eOaXlPRJTVY	995	1008	When they've done everything right. They've gone to an in-network facility and they get stuck with a surprise bill that's very high from an out-of-network provider. Everyone agrees on that. That leaves a very open, discussion about how the provider gets fair payment.
5584	Chavez	Rocky	83	FLwgnBwucWM	1796	1813	I was at an event Saturday with one of my school districts. And I was talking to the county board of education, some of their staff members working on this and which I didn't know is they look at the entire county by zip code.
5585	Wieckowski	Bob	55	WSuppHjpCKY	1021	1043	It only protects this small, minor value and it really small not minor but $75,000 in your house and doesn't really allow the debtors to feel comfortable about opening up their assets to the trustees who will sell it.
5586	De Leon	Kevin	102	7zm3gwdT-l0	81	102	So you already know that coming in already. Is that mean does the UC system wait until there is a level playing field out there whenever that happens in the future? Whether the Legislature, us, continue to move forward on policy.
5587	Dababneh	Matthew	50	tC7sJemEjBU	1397	1410	Clearly there are gonna be animals that endure this research that are physically or, not well enough based on the determination of health to be adopted out into these homes.
5588	Gomez	Jimmy	80	kGJrWtDlyMM	3	35	Yeah.  Good morning. Welcome to the April 22nd, 2015, Assembly Appropriations Committee Hearing. We do not have a quorum. So, we'll start off as a sub-committee. Before we start, let's, I want to welcome our newest colleague onto the Assembly Committee, Assembly Member Richard Bloom. So, let's give him a warm welcome.
5589	Cannella	Anthony	61	ISFND_-5pCw	99	123	But even that, to set a goal to California to combat climate change, there's a great cost to that and remember there's a lot of folks in California that barely get by right now. And they pay very high prices for electricity, and when we're trying to change the world, let's please keep those folks that are very much struggling right now in mind when we set those policies, so thank you.
5590	Dababneh	Matthew	50	zdfniIDuOwc	149	164	But clearly by the number of people in this room that have adopted animals through some of the groups that were represented today, These institutions have had to come to them and many times it was not the leadership of those institutions but those individual researchers who said, we don't have anything else to do with these animals, we're going to have to euthanize them.
5591	Hill	Jerry	66	J8Jo0_kPCZ0	1050	1072	Thank you Mr. Chair. Director Ghilarducci for all of your efforts so far on this. Earthquake early warnings had a long history in California, maybe 30 years or so and, we're still trying to get there. Aside from funding, what do you feel is missing that would be needed to bring the program to fruition?
5592	Thurmond	Tony	4	DrSDPcgi_-A	1249	1261	Thanks Chairman. Thank you all for the presentation. First of all, Ms. Lynhall, I want to thank you for everything that you shared about your own experience and the experience of many other parents and for your advocacy.
5593	Olsen	Kristin	15	5Qw_YsDfvQ4	508	532	So come out and join us on Wednesday and as my colleague also said, we'd also love to work with everyone to really highlight the current needs for farmers and farm workers. The speaker and I had an amazing opportunity last week to visit with farm workers and farmers alike throughout the central valley, really understanding the acute desperation right now for water.
5594	Bloom	Richard	2	c9Ojvyv2LI0	196	219	and Geothermal Resources, affectionately known as DOGR, to development of hydraulic fracturing regulations and to complete an independent scientific study on well stimulation treatments to better protect our public's health and safety against an activity that's been largely, even though it's been going on for many years,
5595	Monning	Bill	25	GMJQ-TfW0Eo	356	381	So, there's an economic determinant here as well, it is unsustainable.  But, more important than the economics, is the quality of life.  Children who don't have a choice because it's not an informed choice are being sentenced to adulthoods of complex medical treatment; amputations, lost productive capacity.
5596	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	P6cBeme--dw	579	599	I rise in opposition to this bill. You know, this has been the toughest issue that I've had to deal with and I would have told you three years ago if somebody had asked, you know, "where are you on this?" and say "I believe in medical freedom and choice, of course."
5597	Bloom	Richard	2	c9Ojvyv2LI0	266	288	transportation, while at the same time taking a serious leap forward in our fight against climate change, something that California is now recognized for around the world. But we have much more to do, and much of this work needs to address and respond to our most pressing matter, climate change. California's climate, the world's climate, is changing.
5598	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	P6cBeme--dw	599	617	Like so many people, my colleague from Salinas and others, I experienced my mother dying in front of my eyes, a bone cancer, breast cancer that then spread to her bones and it was very, very hard.
5599	Mendoza	Tony	52	nJXs6pD2ors	2196	2213	While we understand it's going to suspense, we're looking forward to working with the committee staff and with you to work out some of those costs, and lower some of those costs that the department has foreseen. As the Senator said, we do see that the licensing fees would offset some of those costs, and hope that we can work that out.
5600	Stone	Mark	20	hrVBNy8V670	981	989	We do have a motion and a second. I would also like to remain apart of the conversation and if you'd add me as co-author I would appreciate it.
5601	Kim	Young	82	g07XaAgsb-U	1616	1627	Thank you so much for being with us. Chairman, thank you again for holding this very timely, informative hearing today. I've learned so much here today and, I want to
5602	Mendoza	Tony	52	5EeaivfMcyY	963	980	So to say that you know, I think it's misleading to say, well, we should only focus on who's actually making the record, but not focus on who's getting paid and how those financial arrangements are being made. That somehow that's outside of what the court reporter board should be doing.
5603	Block	Marty	59	Ouu9P0a4sNE	2293	2310	Okay. All right. Thank you. One question I have. It, the projects you mentioned, asbestos projects and other categories. Have you, at this point, of the Department of Ed prioritize exactly which projects will get the 3 million, in what order?
5604	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	qjDm_sZ-lfo	591	604	Unfortunately, it may never exist. And, what is happening here, and I have three or four examples of AILA attorneys who, on their website, one of them suggests in an advertisement that you can get a consultation, and they call it for hopes and dreams.
5605	Dababneh	Matthew	50	tC7sJemEjBU	1947	1959	I do believe we've done a lot to make sure that we're accommodating in this bill. But the true definition of health or whether or not it comes down to suitability I agree with the language in the amendments.
5606	Dodd	Bill	71	nZHmIMh0aaI	698	714	So I guess, how many other commissions are there in other states? Does New York have one? Does Nevada have one? I'm wondering if it makes sense for you guys to be working with other states and say let's get this thing under control. Yes.
5607	Atkins	Toni	110	mOqF8MknDiY	2088	2110	Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members. I would just say in response to Chief Bejarano, we will, between now and appropriations, work certainly with the sponsors, and, and the stakeholders to determine what amount of flexibility we can give on the amount of time. So, thank you for, for that comment. With that, I would ask for an aye vote. Thank you.
5608	Hancock	Loni	98	_MyNlUiIS5o	626	648	Which if there's any deterrence in penalties, consistency in clarity is probably a very good thing. So I'm happy to support your bill and I think we have to keep working on the larger issues so that all of our hospital personnel are safe. You can read the roll.
5609	Alejo	Luis	9	dAAyQzjyhS0	101	116	And also we're to learn from the County's efforts to address water quality as well as water supply. And we're hoping that the lessons learned in Tulare County will be used for the communities across the state that will be grappling with similar challenges.
5610	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	vjd6Y9hnzuc	344	362	So what is being done? Has there been a request made in the budget this year? I mean this is the first that I think some of us are hearing about this. We're talking about a 1.7, maybe $2 million to maintain these, and perhaps bring two of them down to the place where two-thirds of the population of California live.
5611	Bonilla	Susan	3	VbSjp8j5tnU	1285	1301	And then Senator Leno is the last one? I forgot about Stone. All right, thank you so much. This is item number 1, SB 149. To due pass as amended to appropriations, investigational drugs, biologic products or devices and the right to try. Thank you.
5612	Anderson	Joel	57	Q1vYBQdDLNc	687	712	I'm honored to recognize their tireless efforts with state certificates of recognition. First, we have President, Chris Herzog. Chris, if you would wave. Is she out there? Excellent, she's from Lakeside, and then we also have the first Vice President, Toby Kahan, thank you very much, from Covina.
5613	Anderson	Joel	57	Q1vYBQdDLNc	670	687	1,500 trees were collected from all over the world, but most of them do not have plaques indicating what they are or where they're from, and Chris and her team has resurrected this project and their dedication and commitment is something that I'm inspired by and very proud of. We all should be.
5614	Hertzberg	Robert	99	VHKwUGu3F0g	1047	1064	Four zero, we'll keep that open, thank you very much Madam Leader appreciate excellence. Okay we're gonna, Nguyen, we're gonna put you at the end, is that okay? Madame Vice Chair. Okay, Senator Mendoza, SCA 8. Filer number two
5615	Gallagher	James	108	hrVBNy8V670	1974	1991	It's available and that we want, you know, counties to be looking at as a possible tool to deal with situation. So, you know, I think if we're moving forward the Eggman bill, I don't think there's any issue with also moving forward with Ms Waldron's bill.
5616	Leno	Mark	60	13FyHcfWoOM	1729	1741	And, we won't have to go through this every few years and to have the same arguments put forward about how devastating this will be to job growth and the economy, when we've just done it and we have proof positive that quite the opposite has happened.
5617	Patterson	Jim	119	wr_Nl1-RdXY	929	957	Well, first of all the governor initiated and suggested it. I'm assuming that when he did, he appropriately understood a connection there. If the GHG connection is tenuous. I would be willing to accept a general fund allocation.
5618	De Leon	Kevin	102	uaZYquORnnU	57	77	Mister Chair, as well as Mr. Leno and members in absentia, Senate Resolution number 37 calls upon the legislature, the Governor, as well as our fine president, President Obama, to consider the policy implications of the recently released papal encyclical, on the environment and climate change.
5619	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	Jfvd2Tinaec	33	53	Thank you, a quorum has been established. We have 13 bills on file today. Three of them are on consent and one has been pulled. The bills on consent are AB 1339 by Mr. Santiago, AB 1452 by Mr. Hadley, ACR 60 by Mr. Santiago.
5620	Weber	Shirley	44	nmXPXxV6MnM	1319	1362	It is possible that a lot of the salaries, but it's not evident in the material that we get is often driven by Grants that people get as well, so we're not seeing the full picture and when you don't see the full picture and you feel a sense of frustration, you feel the resistance by the administration to share the full picture, then people are left to draw their own picture and I think that's what we're getting at this point from the Legislature, a sense of frustration, a lack of what we consider sometimes cooperation by the University of California to provide everyone with the information that is there and to try to develop some sense of interaction or control that we might have with the University of California concerning what it needs to do in terms of being more of a player and a partner in the challenges that we face in the state.
5621	Hall	Isadore	1	ewcXToh_gOY	172	189	The authors, the, your office have declined to accept the Chair's amendments on this. These amendments that you're passing out now, neither side, the republican side of the house and the democratic side of the house have not seen these in this committee.
5622	Rendon	Anthony	120	KpERIVYvrj0	581	600	The decision deprives the county of its right to challenge projects that encroach into its territory, and potentially displace and disrupt county populations. AB 1119, provides counties with the same tools that cities have to challenge and engage with infrastructure developments In or own territory.
5623	Morrell	Mike	51	uymj8kL8SYs	1331	1357	Well, you know, somebody mentioned the facts earlier today. Yeah, it, you know, it was passed without a two-thirds vote. Also I kinda disagree. We have the lowest tax rate in America but not necessarily lowest property taxes. Arizona by the way, right next door to us, they're at eight tenths of one percent and with property values about thirty, thirty-five percent lower.
5624	Wolk	Lois	94	w5F9O887PfA	681	699	Madame President 802 resolves two barriers to robust implementation of the governors 2030 efficiency goals. First stranded energy savings below title 24 and 2, ineffective implementation of the Energy Commission's existing building benchmarking program.
5625	Hueso	Ben	48	j_YjnTPR-gU	698	715	Wonderful, and I just want to praise your approach. I think it's much overdue that we work on this. There's a body of information already in our state suggests that we need to do something to address this, and I wanna applaud you taking on this issue.
5626	Pan	Richard	96	h3qpDny4S5o	995	1010	That basically we should be able to come up with a much more accurate measure of that ratio and I do believe that what the auditor recommended, the one that the department says they can't.
5627	Garcia	Eduardo	38	9aoEJ21mmKA	1496	1516	A petition was presented to State Water Resources Control Board, where we also had over 100 plus entities, individuals from the local community, coming before the water board to ensure that the state's attention to this issue becomes a priority.
5628	Lara	Ricardo	107	FsWgeFm-Dtc	1277	1296	Okay, members, this is 5 to 0, that bill is out. Thank you, Senator Mathis, for going above and beyond duty. Members we're going to go back and close on the items that we currently have open, beginning with AB 220. Secretary, call the roll.
5629	Pan	Richard	96	h3qpDny4S5o	1010	1026	I actually think there's accurate information there. We can look at this I mean if we can refine it in a way that looks at the cases and claims. I think we can come up with a much more accurate measure of what's going on and I do believe we can find benchmarks for that.
5630	McCarty	Kevin	22	ZcJSZ4qEe4Y	631	642	And so, this bill simply expands the state preschool program to insure that every low income four-year-old has the opportunity to attend preschool following up on, on last year's budget act.
5631	De Leon	Kevin	102	w3XqiN30Dys	1745	1756	That it satisfies everyone, and at the end of the day the end result is not satisfactory to us when the voters themselves will have the choice to question before them whether they support it or not.
5632	Bloom	Richard	2	c9Ojvyv2LI0	1645	1667	I think that $2.3 $1 billion estimate came from the LAO who will be speaking at the end of our meeting, so we can address that question at that time too. And as you mentioned we'll have better information this afternoon and can probably make some better projections based on the outcome of the first auction.
5633	Wolk	Lois	94	2V6gzfYtqAs	61	93	Everything that we're giving to them, which is probably what happens, at that time. And I think that that's worth quite a bit of thought and action. But, I'm not comfortable, with just, eliminating the way the screenings are set up and stored at the moment, unless we look at this in a more global fashion. So, that's where I am at the moment.
5634	Wood	Jim	72	jKVkIx_af_k	1587	1601	The identifiers make it easy to trace contaminations and health hazards to their source. Local country and city ordinances regarding cultivations would be honored. A cultivator would have to apply to a city or county for a provisional cultivation permit.

Today we celebrate her long and distinguished career and her dedication to public service. Please help me in thanking her.
5636	Mitchell	Holly	64	d16C5zYyC-4	1583	1598	A couple of very brief things. Mr. Budnick, as I listen to you, it occurred to me that there's also another issue on the flip side of that same coin in terms of support of services that the community colleges need for their students to be successful.
5637	Nielsen	Jim	68	b8mZhVlBtpE	1363	1376	I understand I guess we don't have any language yet that relates to this per the budget trailer bill is that correct? There's no language yet. We know what we're talking about but we don't have the specifics is that correct?
5638	Hall	Isadore	1	bP5invw1wi4	257	273	Thank you for being bold and strong, to bring this piece of legislation forward. And I am certainly happy to recommend it a do pass on this piece of legislation, once we start or establish a quorum. Are there any other comments, Senator Hill?
5639	Brown	Cheryl	13	YyQcVb02jrM	1423	1443	So that Means they have to get on the freeway and drive to Orange County or drive to Los Angeles or some place where there are with their jobs. So, whenever people talk about housing, it's just the different than in San Jose where I'm sure if something goes vacant is picked up right away. It'll stay there for quite a while?
5640	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	OIbMOKdbCjk	296	319	But we do stand and we do stand on your shoulders and I know Senator Watson when I was on state Commission on the status women many years ago, you were a trail blazer. You were a trailblazer who said we don't take no for an answer. I've tried to follow that model for better and for worse, I might say. But I try to follow that
5641	Beall	Jim	92	31Xp8hxYTr4	469	489	Thank you chair and members. This bill is SB 431 and I would like to accept the committee amendments, it's a companion piece to Senator Hernandez's bill, I'd like to first point out.
5642	Chau	Ed	116	UrwGLPEFGk4	358	370	The second question deals with federal dollars. What are some of the examples, what are some of the ways that we could leverage federal dollars in the area of housing and particularly affordable housing?
5643	Linder	Eric	39	rw_EhgHmCSQ	551	562	I don't know if this is the best question for you, or for someone later down the line, but what's the the best technology that's actually used and in place, maybe elsewhere in the world?
5644	Weber	Shirley	44	_b18tzFsHIo	625	638	Participation incentives for DVBE with veterans making up more than 50% of their workforce. And in Senate preference for DVBE seeking to act as a prime contractor, as well as participation and centers for new DVBE's.
5645	Leno	Mark	60	tqB--Js_f48	985	996	And the numbers of children and students that we benefit is going to grow as a result of result of this action. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off.
5646	Nazarian	Adrin	36	mRtWZWKaAFE	948	961	And at sometime in the future when we've given enough time to see the back and forth and how the industry has been shaping through time, maybe we can figure out If we need to revisit that issue.
5647	Nazarian	Adrin	36	S1Uh1iJn4R0	1203	1214	And last but not least usually we highlight all the mistakes and don't highlight the positives so, thank you to the BOE staff for getting the report back to us prior to the April 1st deadline. Appreciate it, thank you. Thank you all.
5648	Mullin	Kevin	31	llrxaJMn6L0	457	473	Thank you Madame Chair. Mr. Calderon, thank you very much for bringing the bill. My district is the epicenter of life sciences, biotech, pharmaceutical industry. I know that PhRMA was listed in opposition, but I believe you've been having some fruitful conversations.

This policy however, has the unfortunate consequences that when a new licensee must pay a full initial license fee.
5650	McGuire	Mike	93	Wa-w6phRJTk	835	851	No, I appreciate that you, and Sarah and I were just mentioning that. You're absolutely right. So thank you so much, and related to wait times, that has been an issue that we've had with individuals that have come forward is, very concerned on what those penalties would be.
5651	Dodd	Bill	71	JKPJXBAVEPo	1018	1029	Mr. Chair we have Senator Hill as a cosponsor on this bill. He saw what we were trying to get at and agreed to it. I met him before we submitted this bill.
5652	McGuire	Mike	93	u9WQRBoV7yg	355	373	Overdose deaths involving opiat pain relievers now exceed the number of deaths from heroin and cocaine combined. The centers for disease control and prevention has classified prescription drug abuse as a national epidemic and communities across this great state continue to struggle with this pressing issue.
5653	Moorlach	John	4657	qnIAoFuwUn0	1046	1056	Oh you've already discussed it. I'm new, so just forgive me.  It was a big number so I just thought how did it not get included. So that, that answers it.
5654	Lara	Ricardo	107	pchCRkcA1Ic	193	213	We also want to say Mr. Chair that we accept the technical amendment offered by the health committee which will require OSP, OSHPD to include in its current responsibility and element for addressing the mental health needs of vulnerable communities which will include communities that experience trauma related to genocide.
5655	Fuller	Jean	49	BvEiMZK1K8A	1209	1227	These experiences encourage creative learning in children, adolescents, and adults and give them a chance at learning how to do public speaking as well, which I think we all value. Throughout the last 10 years, arts education programs have enjoyed significant investments by the State of California and continue to see support by the Legislature.
5656	Olsen	Kristin	15	yGdC7D9fPQ8	1289	1312	But to put such broad language in a bill that allows fines of up to $8000 every day and to provide no process for that property owner, that water rights holder to be able to make his or her her case to a fair impartial process is not, it's just an-American.
5657	Roth	Richard	106	m8iyuGdEmL0	1390	1405	We understand expedite. We understand what that means. We deal with that all the time We would rather you not put a particular, attach a particular number of days to the permit application process because it all depends. It depends on, are we dealing with a ramp?
5658	Frazier	Jim	114	kJUQLNRw8o8	1335	1348	And as you know Dr. Weber as we worked last year on the early intervention, for the children on the autistic spectrum, of getting that reinstated the success is absolutely outstanding about mainstreaming children after that point.
5659	Mitchell	Holly	64	lanFVKv-H-g	1789	1807	That's out, 2-1. Item 4140, Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development Oshped, item one, elective percutaneous coronary intervention program outcomes reporting. The recommendation is to reprove the modifications of the language.
5660	Hertzberg	Robert	99	CY8dWb1-gXw	2257	2288	So, in the final, the final point that what you're hearing here, Madam Speaker is this discussion, you know this committee is both, as it relates to your house, the local Government Committee and the Rev an Tax Committee combined and we have had a lot of measures in some form or another, dealing with tax credits and deductions and things like that. So we are gonna sit back and try to develop a broader strategy, of how we think we should be dealing with that, where our priorities are because it's just spending money on the other side of the balance. So you're getting a piece of that larger conversation that's dominating much of our committee hearing.
5661	Allen	Benjamin	70	-yLqvo8WX6M	346	360	I'd love to hear from both sides about the extent to which, you know, we understand the bobcat population trends around the state. Is there overpopulation? Is there not? I want to get a better sense of this.
5662	Hueso	Ben	48	aPs2U6ZJJP0	62	83	We'll leave the roll open for absent members that has, that bill has enough to get out. We will take up item number two, AB 802 by Assemblymember Williams and that is a do pass. If we can entertain a motion, a do pass motion. We have a motion. Clerk, please call the roll.
5663	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	7UN1Ta_jlck	1509	1525	schools. The Supreme Court Chief Justice California, Earl Warren deliver this decision in unambiguous terms, "in the field of education the doctrine of separate but equal has no place." We should all be proud that California's constitution
5664	Thurmond	Tony	4	y-mPYI-CNoc	834	849	If you don't feel move to speak, that's fine too but, we don't want anyone who has come here today with the message that they want to be heard, in regard to IHSS, to not have the opportunity to do so.
5665	Jones	Brian	42	FiCM7bENNUU	1025	1039	Ms. Eggman, this is another bill I came in today preparing to vote no on. But while we were sitting here, I texted my wife. She's an interior decorator. And I had never heard of this problem before and I asked her, have you ever heard of this, and she said yes.
5666	Eggman	Susan Talamantes	73	qzvpjn8Cr2Y	845	869	she had seen nurse practitioners and other systems when she had insurance before. So it was very real to me in that time. Which is why I agreed to do this bill this year with Senator Hernandez. And people know I've been a longtime healthcare practitioner working in around the Medical Association as well as with a lot of nurses and physicians.
5667	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	5o713VccuaM	2039	2052	AB 696 would amend Penal Code 991 to allow courts to make a probable cause determination for both out of custody as well as in custody misdemeanor defendants but will not require the determination to be made at arraignment.
5668	Hueso	Ben	48	e0V9_HL0L10	10	67	Welcome to this oversight hearing of the Senate Energy, Utilities and Telecommunications Committees. Sorry about that. Should at least get that right. Today, we're gonna hear a report from the Public Utilities Commission.
5669	Garcia	Eduardo	38	GUxOzh3Wh0Q	95	111	Issues dealing with grid reliability will have to be highly considered therefore procuring renewable energy resources with the best fit attributes that insure great reliability and help meet the state's green house gas goals, should be a priority.
5670	Gomez	Jimmy	80	kLTY4thtXsA	1667	1690	We have a motion and a second. Any witnesses in support? Individuals from the public in support? Witnesses in opposition? Individuals from the public in opposition? Questions or comments from the committee members? Come on guys, you don't want to ask him a question? No. Seeing no questions or comments, would you like to close, Mr. Gallagher?
5671	Allen	Benjamin	70	y6U-ceBCkoc	108	126	In a letter to the Department of Fish and Wildlife from 2013, the board said that recreational suction dredging as a whole has disproportionately greater effect on mercury resuspension, which is like agitation and then redistribution of mercury, when compared to other natural events or human activities.
5672	Garcia	Eduardo	38	GUxOzh3Wh0Q	66	83	As California moves towards renewable energy resources beyond the 33% mandate and achieving the state's greenhouse gas goals best fit attributes of the renewable energy resources, in addition to their total cost, should be taken into consideration.
5673	Monning	Bill	25	Wt_ez7F9UlE	1632	1644	So that a court can make an informed decision and hopefully work towards the reunification of the family. So thank you for bringing this forward. Madam Chair I'm glad to move the bill to the appropriate time.
5674	Fuller	Jean	49	AO5QavLO0SY	780	799	We want to join you in the parade today and we're very pleased with Sharon who is one of the original, Sharon Runner, who is one of the original planners of the parade and involved in all levels, and she has children that serves. Thank you.
5675	Mitchell	Holly	64	SNbIvbnUyMw	982	1004	Thank you very much, Mr. Pro Tem. Thank you for the time we've spent together. As I listened to the Pro Tem's last question, I think it really is important and I think we spend a lot of time in this committee digging deeply into performance metrics of various department heads, but it really is a matter of executive management.
5676	Grove	Shannon	77	wK5CwGDTeOM	787	806	I think that we would have addressed this issue much sooner and I just applaud the author for bringing it forward because what my colleague from Salinas did say about people having to put these black tanks outside their homes and then water being able to be brought on a daily basis because when they turn on their tap water, nothing comes out.
5677	Block	Marty	59	4HKs3ChJG74	159	176	And the administration supporting this cooperative effort to use existing revenues to repurpose some middle class scholarship dollars that the CSU and others found to be not used to their maximum potential.
5678	Monning	Bill	25	1RSWS8bipGw	1244	1260	to communities to access the state parks, it seems like there could be a lot learned and, drawn from that. But really just to thank you both and as I think everybody has said including Secretary Laird, the original requests to service commissioners
5679	Block	Marty	59	4HKs3ChJG74	176	189	And to take these dollars and use them instead to hire more faculty. To hire more student service employees. To help students graduate in four years. To do more with Cal grants. Make more dollars available to students.
5680	Daly	Tom	118	dfinQbvsuZo	321	338	Thank you Mr. Speaker and members. This bill establishes the sport franchise license plate program. This new program allows as California professional boards franchises to make the logos available for use on specialty license plates. I want to thank my colleague Mr. Thurmond who was the coauthor of this.
5681	Hancock	Loni	98	omDEH7LCBKo	993	1030	This expansion of the vision of the master plan for higher education can truly be integrated and then we can start addressing that. With me is Maureen Thompson, she's a correctional educator at Soledad prison, academic recently of one of these voluntary education program teachers. Part of their duty is to coordinate the existing college programs. She probably has some comments on how that can be improved and how the transition might go better. that would be great that I need you by the way
5682	Liu	Carol	63	14lq834z9Pc	2228	2255	I have a quick question. Here on page three of the analysis, it indicates that in 2011-12 there were 16 pilots In the community colleges to try to accelerate the remediation classes, the basic skills classes. And I'm just curious as to whether or not those pilots are still going on or whether or not they can be scaled up as best practices, etc?
5683	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	h8s0v2JD3F8	1702	1728	So, I'd be interested in your comments about the claim that this will reduce competition, reduce our opportunity to really provide apprenticeship, which I think is a very excellent concept. And Assembly member Keeley was someone whose values and opinions I valued tremendously. So I'd be interested if you would comment on that.
5684	Bonilla	Susan	3	KvteTWNshTw	627	640	Yeah, we have been talking with the post office, and as written it wouldn't be a problem for their automated machines. We were specifically discussing the bar code placement with them.
5685	Eggman	Susan Talamantes	73	v8Lqd5JpuF0	401	410	I think this is imperative so that we can really provide the veterans the care that they need in an equitable way, throughout the rest of their lives. Thank you.
5686	Runner	Sharon	4656	LFikd5rYakY	843	869	Thank you madam President and members. I rise in support of this measure. I believe it's one of the first steps that we can use to actually regulate medical marijuana. I know some of my colleagues are concerned because it's marijuana, but it's been legal for 20 years, it's for medical purposes
5687	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	L_nqL1xdfS8	1286	1308	AB 60 is a consumer protection measure which will extend those existing protections to about 1.5 million Californians that may be eligible to receive relief under the President's executive action if it ever comes about. A Texas' federal judge's injunction of DAPA and DACA creates a large window of opportunity for predatory practices in our state.
5688	Beall	Jim	92	gB0SqdP0x6o	1309	1335	Thank you very much. I wanted to ask you some more the budget questions about this program. is this program intended to complete the fiscal year without any additional resources?
5689	Leno	Mark	60	bv9YSPFbNEk	506	529	Okay, but the staff recommendation to augment the governor's restoration of competency request for 10.3 million general fund by 6.1 million for a total of 16.4. That 6.1 million will come from the savings of the rejection of the 105 IST beds?
5690	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	7LRhPIA-4tY	326	352	because he either doesn't give a damn, or it's just not in his repertoire to get past that. And I think that's what happens in a lot of government positions, that you have people that are just kind of following along, making sure they don't step out of line and not willing to take the risk to ensure that we have a diverse work group. So I know that was a lot, but-
5691	Gallagher	James	108	5dSl7g7OdCI	1249	1263	Thank you Mr. Chairman and members. I'm proud to present to you today ACA 3 and I've brought this measure forward because I think we've all now come to agree and learn that retroactive pension increases are bad public policy.
5692	Pan	Richard	96	oyj26fO_o0A	901	913	We actually want to recognize the work of the first five commissions and the home visitations. Which has really paved the way here in California. Many of the first five commissions did fund home visitation programs.
5693	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	xbFtMrlj2T4	1585	1596	And it'll be interesting to see what the result is. Hopefully a positive one. Very good. Please, this is a motion do pass to Senate Appropriations. Please call the roll.
5694	Chiu	David	7	cZs_HLTVPT4	58	83	By discouraging vehicles from obstructing these transit-only lanes, the program has been critical to improving transit safety and reducing congestion in our critical downtown corridors. It's also been critical to San Francisco that this program continues, given that our city streets are among the most congested in the entire country, with a public transit system that has an average speed of eight miles per hour and carries 800,000 riders a day.
5695	Lara	Ricardo	107	ZLCilf2DCec	134	165	Thank you Madame President, AB 679 would extend the deadline for prescribers and dispensers of controlled substances to enroll in California's controlled substance utilization review and evaluation system, CURES, as it's known, by six months from January 1, 2016, to July first 2016.  In 2013, SB 809 established a requirement for all prescribers and dispensers of controlled substances to register in the CURES database but January 1, 2016, so they could access the information in the system.
5696	Wolk	Lois	94	xG-KiREcweY	1981	2005	Alright, that is three to zero, and the last two items that pertained to this permit and the enforcement backlog recommendation, the use of Envirostor for compliance measures including those prior to 2008, and four, implementation of staff training, quality control and data inspection, and reporting of enforcement actions prior to 2008. Is there a motion?
5697	Alejo	Luis	9	6rjOa1qOGPA	431	453	Well we drafted this bill is so there isn't any conflict with any of those other messages that indicated plus, this is only designed to deal like we mentioned earlier, special, general and primary. It will be one day, at most two days during an election like 2016. And in some years, no message whatsoever, all year long.
5698	Beall	Jim	92	pjSDFWGC8xY	1074	1098	We're gonna have an earthquake, we're gonna have those floods, and when we do we better be ready for them. And to come out with some proposal that under funds transportation, maintenance, and repair is unconscionable. Because all you're doing is recreating a worse situation than you had before, and that just passes it on to the next generation.
5699	Nazarian	Adrin	36	378WZJyyxT0	1130	1157	So at this point, and given the strong urging of the secretary himself, I'm inclined to approve the request, but would like to ask the department to come back, not only next January, to give an update. But when we are having a interim hearing in fall, I'd like for you to bring an update on how the discussions are going on an ongoing basis.
5700	Beall	Jim	92	0ONi8JCQxHk	55	68	This is the Senate Transportation and Housing Committee, in case you're not in the right room. I'm the chairman, Jim Beall. I'd like to welcome everybody to our meeting.
5701	Beall	Jim	92	0ONi8JCQxHk	69	92	First of all I'd like everybody that has a cell phone on to turn it off. Conversations. Do not have conversations in the room. We've got way too many people to listen to the proceedings over your conversations. So if you would like to make comments or have conversations with people, leave the room.
5702	Cannella	Anthony	61	HIvUnJIEbGs	525	539	Okay, thank you. Those are your witnesses? Okay. At this time we'll have other witnesses in opposition. Same rules apply. State your name, your organization, and that you're in opposition to the bill. Anymore, and I'll unfortunately have to cut you off.
5703	Mitchell	Holly	64	qSESWnQqhic	1258	1272	Thank you very much, Senator Pavley. Please bring the name forward, so it can be entered in the file and express our condolences to the family. Motions and resolutions? Senator Monning, for what purpose do you rise?
5704	Garcia	Eduardo	38	hMsGJE3-_OM	226	241	This massive body of water in our district is shrinking, and will expose a dry lake bed that will kick up dust in the region, with adding to the already poor quality standards that exist.
5705	Wolk	Lois	94	BhpjNxoKRfU	1707	1719	Just a very brief comment Mr. Chairman. I want to thank the author for taking this on. Long overdue and difficult. But, you know, I hope that you'll be successful. And, I would like to be a co-author on this.
5706	Jones	Brian	42	xdTTK0YoutY	1737	1754	served as the founder and first President of the California Special Districts Association, running it from his garage for several years. He began a successful effort with Speaker Unruh and the State Treasurer to create participation certificates for special districts,
5707	Gordon	Richard	117	9MQl_MfHN90	445	478	To solve this problem, AB241 would under specific circumstances require, the public entity to provide retiree contact information to a 501C5 organization for the purpose of advocating on behalf of the retirees' financial interest. I'm pleased to take the language outlined in the committee analysis to, one, set a civil penalty for misuse of this private information at the cost of $25,000, and to allow retired employees or their beneficiaries to opt out of this disclosure.
5708	Jones	Brian	42	xdTTK0YoutY	1754	1773	enabling them to apply low-cost financing of projects. His work at this Special Districts Association is still recognized today in their annual Hollingsworth Award of Excellence. After his retirement from Olivenhain, water and special districts from all over the state in need of reorganization sought Bill
5709	Leno	Mark	60	EkjCB3EukYI	1046	1073	best to become nicotine free not cigarette free. 123 cities and counties in California have already done what this bill proposes to do today. It's time for the entire state to move in this direction. What it does specifically is brings e-cigarettes under our state's smoke-free laws, which will restrict where they can be smoked,
5710	Atkins	Toni	110	mOqF8MknDiY	366	378	There has been no negative impact claimed in these states' markets and, in fact, Ohio recently lifted the cap on what their document recording fee could produce because there was so much need and it's working so well.
5711	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	I1DeZTgw_DI	1290	1300	No, this would cover the state of California as well, but I would note that, of course, most of the workers in the state of California are, in fact, covered by a collective bargaining agreement that satisfies the opt-out provision.
5712	Thurmond	Tony	4	2b3SgDbb8jI	1686	1702	We're working very closely with the Player's Association also continue to get their investment in this issue. We know it's complicated, but we think that the success of this type of a ban hinges on having support from the actual users, and that's the players. So we move this forward.
5713	Irwin	Jacqui	16	24W2oeMkjbI	800	812	This bill outlines a proven model of success that will lead to substantial cost savings by replacing less efficient models of basic skills courses and stream lining student's path to completion.
5714	Levine	Marc	8	gP-mCxG_DCU	1659	1680	Thank you, sir. AB 900 seeks to better align state and federal law in order to protect vulnerable, unaccompanied, immigrant minors up to 21 years old. Under existing law, probate court is going to establish guardianship for these youth only up to age 18. AB 900 will allow the courts to establish guardianships for those youth up to 21 years of age. And thereby provide immigration relief in two ways.
5715	Thurmond	Tony	4	2b3SgDbb8jI	1671	1686	Our bill would simply say that we care about kids. And that all the places where players could be in the presence of kids that they should not use chewing tobacco in the dugouts, places where kids could be present and see their heroes using chewing tobacco.
5716	Mullin	Kevin	31	17weTAXeEGA	1097	1118	We're going to pass temporarily on item 21. We're also going to pass temporarily on items 22, 23, and 24. We've dispensed with item 25. We're moving to file item 26, members.
5717	Gomez	Jimmy	80	QXW5aikdMmE	1382	1396	Republicans not voting. AB 64, Chavez, early employment reinstatement holding committee. AB 67, Gonzalez, double pay on the holiday, due pass with amendments to provide double pay on Thanksgiving only and other technical amendments. B roll call.
5718	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	5jUUOwMdhxk	686	700	That's an interesting question, but why do we mandate a minimum wage at the levels we mandate it on? Why are we stopping at $10, why not stop at $15? There are a number of ways of looking at that, quite frankly.
5719	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	1m7TRZBO2bA	7	34	Thank you, and now I have LeQuan Muhammad, youth leader for Brothers, Sons, Selves Coalition, and Gordon Jackson, the Director of the Coordinated Student Support Division, California Department of Education. Welcome.
5720	Stone	Jeff	26	DwrMQLfFxcs	1527	1546	Thank you, Madam Chair. I strongly support the good survey work that you're doing and it helps us o develop performance standards, if you will. When can we expect to see the results of these surveys? Will it before the fiscal year is up?
5721	Dahle	Brian	47	mHQI7IJaeKM	655	679	So, I think that this bill is appropriate for the time. I think the greenhouse gas reduction fund is appropriate to use. We can manage our forest effectively and reduce carbon and help the wildlife and increase the water yields. I have with me, Julee Malinowski-Ball from the Biomass industry.
5722	Mitchell	Holly	64	DwrMQLfFxcs	1517	1527	Senator Stone? Then I am going to come back and ask you to answer the last question with regard to the role volunteers and our staff played in the closure of Agnews and Lantern, but Senator Stone go ahead.
5723	Hernandez	Ed	103	dCf0VaDDxwk	1511	1528	What I'd like to do, if we don't mind, is we can hear the entire presentation, and we have everyone ask questions after so that if during the presentation we could answer most of your questions. And I'm not trying to stifle any conversation, and by all means, follow up if you guys don't mind we can do that first.
5724	Fuller	Jean	49	MVCeSI-m6QA	1737	1783	She is currently training and competing as a professional track athlete, so keep your eye on her; we're hoping for the olympics. I'm excited and humbled to acknowledge women in sports and my guests, like Ana, and I hope of you will bring your women and men heroes here for us to honor. Thank you all.
5725	McCarty	Kevin	22	Hi5Vq6PdNIY	1408	1425	But, you know, there are roughly. over nearly fifteen thousand employees that are part of that. That essentially have a pension income that is double the rules going forward for other state employees.
5726	Mendoza	Tony	52	2Dc5I9_7zFA	1517	1537	Whenever the low-income housing requirement or agreement is over. Because, unless your bill says that once you allow affordable housing for whatever population you want, doesn't matter, it's forever. Does your bill say it's forever? It'll be on title that the building cannot be used for anything else but affordable housing? Does your bill mandate that or allow for that to happen?
5727	Hancock	Loni	98	FmUMuqWK62w	956	977	They need rehabilitated services and that you go after the traffickers. She has done that. A 2012 report from the California Attorney General's Office down the Alameda County leads the state in prosecuting human trafficking handling 46% of all the cases in human trafficking in the state.
5728	Wood	Jim	72	_Z7ChiMRbIg	245	276	Yeah I'd just like to, first of all, thank you Mr. Gordon for your presentation of the bill here and, I do appreciate where you're going, but I also do have concerns. And I would be more sympathetic honestly towards a more comprehensive approach. Product by product by product by product.  As we go forward here it becomes very, very problematic, and these are already high-cost issues to deal with in landfills. So.
5729	Lara	Ricardo	107	HayxEPtHuzU	396	414	Thank you, I wanted to talk, and I don't know if you guys can answer this, but we've seen a lot of growth in bullying and violence towards cheerleaders or do the cheerleaders, actually is that considered a sport, and is that covered under Title IX?
5730	Grove	Shannon	77	G-cKeAHj51U	1930	1938	- based on the comment that you just made about the Secretary of the State taking off a year, writing these regulations, there's nothing in your bill that says that counties have to follow it.
5731	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	ospSq9hYks4	526	541	Yes, thank you Mr. Chairman and to our co-chairs. This is a rather important dialogue and thank the State Auditor for comprehensive report. More of a comment than a question, feel free to respond with the Chairman's indulgence.
5732	Stone	Mark	20	rb93slzi3ec	745	766	Indeed. And let me respond to that. Let me read from the bill, okay? It says, the court shall order, sealed, all records pertaining to that dismissed petition in the custody of the juvenile court, and in the custody of law enforcement agencies, the probation department, and any other public agency having records pertaining to the case.
5733	Hancock	Loni	98	RJGZrXESD6M	1631	1653	In talking to individuals, they indicated they might be willing to go back to a two-year sunset, but what I'm noticing is not in the bill is any collection of data that would inform us at the end of that period of time about exactly this sort of thing. How often are they used?
5734	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	P6cBeme--dw	1542	1566	You have no idea how many conversations I've heard from family members that have said he or she is in a better place now than they were before and that God is with them and that they're in a place where they do not have to suffer anymore.
5735	Stone	Jeff	26	npLG8Ena6eQ	1083	1104	On page 12, line 11: the declaration continues to state that the desire to end my life in humane and dignified manner. Can any medical provider guarantee this? It hasn't seemed to work for death row inmates. In conclusion my friends, this bill, this potential law, will give false hope to anyone who thinks that death can be a painless process.
5736	Huff	Bob	105	VyoFcVtTJtQ	9	21	We hadn't seen that before. And from the testimony on that and the other opposition that seemed to be focusing on the obesity crisis, well I would stipulate that we already have 400 minutes over 10 days stipulated, we have obesity.
5737	Weber	Shirley	44	bencsnxh2-c	675	690	So they're kind of protected as they go along with regards to who can and cannot sign for their loans and all those kinds of things that's really unfortunate that happens. But unfortunately, it happens to those who can least afford to have this in their lives, to have a debt of 30, $40,000 and you're unemployed.
5738	Alejo	Luis	9	8MjX_09Duus	1475	1487	For example in my hometown there was one of these projects that wanted to be put right in the middle of relatively one of the newer parks. And the neighborhoods were saying, well, we shouldn't have this right in the middle of our park.
5739	Liu	Carol	63	C_-Yvm-Yyn0	401	419	I know sometime in the packet that was presented to us, and I think it was the Little-Hoover Commission in 2007, recommended that the State Allocation Board take as a model the state's California Transportation Commission.
5740	Thurmond	Tony	4	Dis8InqVM6k	60	65	Because I've heard some people say that yes, we should serve and increase the revenue but we can wait a year or two years or until the budget's this or that and from my perspective, we need to make a decision before September.
5741	Roth	Richard	106	SvIBnS8_PpY	1975	1993	From my perspective its rapidly becoming a social justice issue, so I am concerned about that. I want to make sure administration knows my concern. We are going to have to deal with beginning the process of funding some of these judicial positions sometime and maybe this is the year we've got to think about it.
5742	Pavley	Fran	104	_JbASqkciSI	823	841	Oh, a really important bill and it's not just LAUSD, it's almost everywhere if you go in through campuses now, especially during the recession. The deferred maintenance on these drinking fountains. As my kids would tell you, they're just gross.
5743	Liu	Carol	63	1JV-wI6cFUY	2089	2105	So, I know, I do appreciate everybody's concern about this, it is a, not a problem and I look forward to continuing our work together to try to resolve of this homeless issue.
5744	Bonta	Rob	85	GOY1w5EVdhE	34	49	On the consent calendar today we have the following bills proposed for consent. Item number three, Bill AB 143, Assembly Member Wood, and item number 18, Bill AB 1130, Assembly Member Gray.
5745	Thurmond	Tony	4	NYGfzZLGLck	1605	1618	We have many families in California that have been impacted because of immigrant status and deportations, and our courts have always guaranteed the rights of all before our courts to have due process and the right to a fair trial.
5746	Nielsen	Jim	68	4l8d3tner_c	1422	1440	And there was a quantum shift in the mentality of welfare in America that the Clinton administration later patterned their historic welfare reform on. And the way I characterized it It was not if you need you will receive, but rather that if you need we will help you become employable and employed.
5747	Levine	Marc	8	fnhJHfsu-gk	694	713	And so, when the federal government informed us that our MCO tax does not meet the federal guidelines, that's why the current tax needs to be repealed and replaced with one that actually does leverage federal funds so that Californians don't leave their tax dollars in Washington.
5748	Hancock	Loni	98	esInX6Y5x88	1450	1481	Okay. And then, I'm also interested in the outcomes here. In that, what are the penalties and what happens when an inmate, for example, is bound to be high. This is work that we do now, random urine analysis as I understand it. Do they get a 115? Do they lose credits permanently? Do they go to administrative segregation? Do they go to treatment?
5749	Jones	Brian	42	yhT6yC928zE	394	403	I wanna go back to Mr. Dodd's line of questioning, and then also my earlier concern regarding Accenture. Have they done other projects for the State of California, and have they done other projects for other states?
5750	Frazier	Jim	114	qIsKWbokTQE	920	934	And I appreciate that. And we have been taking amendments suggested by the department or agency going forward, and working with them so your concerns are noted and we would look forward to a vigorous dialogue moving forward.
5751	Hernandez	Roger	37	-yqp2bxPUCM	692	715	Under the terms of the consent decree, the motor carrier must agree to pay all wages and benefits owed to previously misclassified independent contractors, and all taxes owed to the state as a result of such misclassification. In addition, the company must agree to classify any present or future commercial drivers as employees.
5752	Nielsen	Jim	68	PyDS77ZdGH4	787	804	I see that of value, I don't see it as the highest value because we need the bigger storage, but it does fit into the picture. I would not see that kind of storage at the expense of the major storage surveys but it is a part of the plan long-term I see. Okay, thank you.
5753	Leno	Mark	60	b7XHatlYhkw	1969	1983	That would be the expectation in Appropriations, and certainly the chair at any time has authority to bring the bill back if she had further concerns. But we would all support you in amending in that fashion in accordance with the previous effort.
5754	Nazarian	Adrin	36	51wXJ30ZLf4	124	143	The bill makes step therapy override requests subject to 72 hour response for non-urgent requests and within 24 hours for urgent circumstances. Additionally this bill makes step therapy appeal subject to an expedited MIR review process of three days.
5755	Leno	Mark	60	b7XHatlYhkw	1955	1969	Yes, so Madam Chair, I would just suggest that, having expressed our interest in seeing that, and I don't think it should be any broader than what was in the earlier effort.
5756	Hill	Jerry	66	670ewxdSqNM	581	592	Are, are there statutory amendments you believe would be helpful for you to take swift action in the event that you need to do something in the future, like, like this maybe you could think about it.
5757	Beall	Jim	92	gDPCmEU7pmg	1337	1357	I want to raise the issues because I think sup-plantation is a very important thing. I mean we can't decrease taxes and then have...sorry. You didn't miss anything. Anyway, anyway. So that's an issue and I think it's very important to address.
5758	Mathis	Devon	75	BQi8S-IClhU	1271	1292	And, the other part of the question is, how is,  we're putting California veterans at risk of losing their GI Bill system by not having the actual plan set. What is your plan of action, what is the department's plan of action to mitigate that risk and ensure that it does not happen?
5759	Hueso	Ben	48	31W9cfaQWLY	710	736	Thank you, Mr. President. As Vice Chair of the Latino Caucus it is my honor to rise today in strong support of Senate Resolution 14. If we look at the founding of our country, originally only landowners could vote. There was this process by which through amendments to the constitution and by changing legislation did eventually every citizen under the of the United States eventually got the right to vote.
5760	Fuller	Jean	49	Kc7udwSIfNk	84	108	This would be devastating for the residents of this remote rural community as Tehachapi is a critical access hospital with the next closest hospital located more than an hour's drive away. They will be able to resolve the issues build the new hospital if they are allowed to have this recent mission respectfully ask for your aye vote on AB 232.
5761	Mathis	Devon	75	fmIaR7hDQ6w	1527	1553	My biggest question is, I think, and my biggest concern moving forward as the drought continues is what is the plan if we lose a city? If a whole city goes offline, the wells go out, collapse. I mean, that's probably my number one largest concern, and I'm sure everybody here would agree with that. I mean, is there a plan? What is the plan?
5762	Hertzberg	Robert	99	X4Bkp9BrIdE	2036	2054	increase the potential for an attack on information technology system of a public agency. It is the law, it's been the law since 2011 because of the challenges that we face. So, when you get to it, we've taken, with respect to the vendor and product name already in the new amendments,
5763	Bates	Pat	58	R5jZe-4pYBI	745	754	So I won't be able to support it today. I just hope that we continue to work on this issue regarding the CPN because I think that maybe gets me closer.
5764	Leno	Mark	60	tqB--Js_f48	2100	2122	It's a fiscally wise step to be taking, especially in light of Mr. Uhler's comments that we don't of any counties that aren't doing this but if we found through this annual report that that changed, we would definitely be potentially interested in changing our position that we're holding today.
5765	Mitchell	Holly	64	H1s_v6dAj4A	2043	2055	And so to paraphrase and quote your grandmother, which I intend to do with your permission or not. We now know better and therefore are required to lead better.
5766	Allen	Benjamin	70	3SZ2VrPacjs	605	614	But some interesting lessons to be learned. Thank you, thank you very much. All right next we'll hear from A.J. Wilmer and I know Peter Choi is back here as well, and he wants to make some public comments, nice to see you A.J.
5767	Leno	Mark	60	nj31ZcgCRww	370	397	they have proposed regulations that are pending currently and should be finalized hopefully before the end of the summer. And then there are the statements made by the industry itself. They on their advertisements, and I could show you some of them right here. This is RJ Reynolds, vapor, innovative digital tobacco product.
5768	Dababneh	Matthew	50	ocvoub39NwA	56	70	They really become, not only over burdensome, but also become not relevant to the issues at hand as this technology develops and as it enters the marketplace. And I can tell you I've gotten hundreds of emails and phone calls this week about this hearing from my constituents.
5769	Liu	Carol	63	6q5JSfST1YQ	104	115	And at the same time the state must find ways to reduce green house gases and keep people and goods moving. Currently, the plan provides a wide range of general recommendations.
5770	Liu	Carol	63	wXHA3EWrHe8	32	57	The support and opposition will each be provided the opportunity to have three witnesses to speak and each witness has 15 minutes. Five minutes. It's 15 minutes total. Otherwise, we'd be here tomorrow. Everyone else who wishes to be heard may only state your name, city you are from, and position on the bill.
5771	Chiu	David	7	rek1UfAle3c	36	47	I want to first thank Speaker Tony Atkins who is our joint author on this and a long time affordable housing champion as well as the housing committee for their unanimous and bipartisan support.
5772	Gray	Adam	27	NB_4qAwCIAU	238	261	such as exclusivity, Prop 1A, Class Three Gaming, ADW, Moratorium, Rake, 9010, and others. I feel that as the chair of this committee, we owe it to ourselves and the citizens of this great state to be better informed on the history, legality authorization, and regulation of gambling in California before we move forward on any issue,
5773	Gray	Adam	27	NB_4qAwCIAU	224	238	We will not only learn about the regulatory side of things but the history of each legalized gaming sector since its inception in California. In addition I hope we learned about the same, some of the key terms that are associated with each sector,
5774	Jones	Brian	42	d_EaaILk1VE	1186	1200	And, I think Member Olsen is just requesting that this bill have the same privilege as all other bills that go through policy committee and then in approps that at least receive an up or down vote.
5775	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	0HDXR-Yl1D8	1043	1067	By Senator Roth, colleagues, there is a mock-up of an item here that I know Senator Roth has been working on this all weekend. I hope made sure he got the Mother's Day gifts to the appropriate women before he spent the rest of the weekend working on this bill, but I do know that he's worked very hard and diligently on it.
5776	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	OVIQdDmHNzI	150	169	Now, most CEQA applicants know when there is going to be an objection to their proposal. It is up to them to decide whether they want to have the record prepared contemporaneous with the process. We know this saves anywhere from six months to a year.
5777	Achadjian	K.H. "Katcho"	5	xxs1-E5qWdw	40	57	I'm here to represent AB 1178 which will strengthen California's current laws by prohibiting manufacturers from taking negative actions against a dealer when a vehicle exported or resold after the dealer has collected sales tax and registered the vehicle in California.
5778	Dababneh	Matthew	50	ok4qN3L6USs	1708	1723	This bill simply expands options for school districts. Let me repeat that. This bill simply expands options for school districts to use design build and makes changes to the requirements for contractors to prequalify for a design build contract.
5779	Hueso	Ben	48	rXqXXOdeL9w	176	192	Now the whole purpose of this is to ensure that while an auditor can still obtain legal advice that general council does not specifically influence an auditor in the way to conduct an audit.
5780	De Leon	Kevin	102	Mt9BcU600uM	965	999	The current teacher body in the state of California, we went from what? 330 back in the day when I was with the California Teachers Association to now what 260 right now because the worst economic recession since 1929 and the devestating impact some Prop 98 in our K-12 schools, but in particular, schools of highest need throughout the state of California. I think that it's just a good sign for those who are watching on television downstairs that it would be nice for the future, but thank you very much, and thank you very much for your statement and questions Senator Mitchell.
5781	Thurmond	Tony	4	hecrzVTBfRM	1187	1203	Mr Bonta chairs it, Mr Chui and I are members of that Committee. As a result, unless there's objection from the Committee members, I'd like to take action on issue three which is IHSS restoration of 7% across-the-board hours reduction.
5782	Nazarian	Adrin	36	KWh7S198Y54	1177	1222	So it's ultimately, the investments we make here are going to have profound benefits for future generations of kids who will then continue on into arenas of work I wouldn't have thought of; Boeing, but I'm glad that you mentioned it as an example, but what we may not know, what we're investing in right now can yield create benefits. And so, thank you for bringing the measure forward, and look forward to working with this Committee, as well as others, to make sure that we continue the funding of the arts.
5783	Hall	Isadore	1	ewcXToh_gOY	1388	1411	The, the, the senators that are voting, that will be voting on this bill today will be voting in good faith of this bill understanding that the sales component is taken out any amendments thereafter that would try to insert the sales component back in would be taking the, the senators' support today for granted.
5784	Mitchell	Holly	64	LDZM4Nn4wSs	1434	1445	Thank you very much for all the effort put into collecting information from AFLP participants from across the state. Thank you. First witness, and we're gonna ask everyone to keep it within two minutes, please.
5785	Wood	Jim	72	OGSzGIXfLs8	922	935	I'll continue to work with HCD while the bill is on suspense to address the problems previously outlined. And while conversations with the department have been encouraging, I strongly believe that AB 325 continues to be necessary.
5786	Santiago	Miguel	17	LjL6ZVCwjY0	214	235	Because sometimes, and let's create a hypothetical situation that someone can come to us from the UC system and said, look, we're doing really good. We got 25% cultural diversity. And then I take a look, and they all come from the quote unquote, the more affluent, well-to-do communities. Well, my opinion would be not much has been done.
5787	Alejo	Luis	9	_skeu0yft7s	1293	1304	No. As this bill has moved through the legislative process ,the intent always expressed this would be a temporary work permit that will have to be renewed every few years, so it's always intended to be temporary in the true sense of the word.
5788	Wolk	Lois	94	LYOrqHadQ70	982	1003	Yes, Mr. Chair there is an opposition from Canner and their concern, I think we can work with them. My pledge is to work with them on this issue, which is to include advance directives in this registry. We'd like to be able to work with them on this issue without making a commitment to do so at this time.
5789	Hernandez	Roger	37	ukB39_tnTUw	1872	1888	Yeah. The Greenlining Institute are conducted studies that showed consolidation as a benefit. Particularly in LA, where we see a plethora of cities that have just a whole bunch of different dates. We're seeing April elections, we're seeing May elections, we're seeing March elections and
5790	Quirk	Bill	23	CHPaC99Z-AQ	1637	1658	All right, well thank you Chair and Senators. There are a large number of untested rape kits nationwide. AB 909 would require local law enforcement agencies to track and report on the number of rape kits they collect, how many they test, and how many go untested.
5791	Bloom	Richard	2	w6A3dw8D_mc	1818	1847	Like connecting existing homes to water supply and even connecting communities to one another, but when it comes to water treatment facilities and pipelines, these are potentially very large scale projects. And just a blanket exemption from CEQA without a significant conversation, that seems like a long way to go here. Mr. Gordon?
5792	Leno	Mark	60	PFn_-ARbOZU	1487	1502	But, that there are going to be a number of steps that have to be taken between our getting the approval of the waiver amendment. Counties have to submit their implementation plans.
5793	Vidak	Andy	56	iTrvWXqiedk	2475	2492	Well my question then, it almost looks like this actually encourages people, because they know it's not going to be enforced, and then the folks that don't know this are seeing people run stop signs. We saw actually people going around people that had stopped and it's actually creating a bigger problem I think.
5794	De Leon	Kevin	102	pmq1wDNXXkw	1037	1056	Is that we can't get stuck here, we really gotta go down here. I think the dealers are gonna play a pivotal role in terms of turning on the consumer once they walk onto the lot. If that connection is not there, then we're gonna have all these rebates, sort of, kind of, tucked off on a shelf.
5795	Stone	Mark	20	f1-nJuHExxE	956	970	Motion and a second. Any other questions, comments? Senator, thank you for bringing this forward and with that, the recommended motion is do pass as amended to appropriations and Senator if you would like to close.
5796	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	qW3ZYP7zbss	1304	1327	And again, I'll make it brief cause the hour is late. For me, what I would like to do is really focus in on the victims and I say that because as I'm learning more and more about it, you have a young person at 11 or 10 years old that basically gets brainwashed into this.
5797	Weber	Shirley	44	SWbNiLMydRA	814	827	Two, when ambulances respond to accidents and illnesses when victims are not involved with any criminal activity. And three, situations where recording would risk the safety of a confidential informant or undercover peace officer.
5798	Irwin	Jacqui	16	HWoLP0nhI7A	594	613	That would be, maybe that's some explanation as to I don't know what the percentage is of Vets that are going into these programs, but certainly it's criminal to take four years of benefits and end up with an education that's ten years behind in technology.
5799	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	goLRzsDXvfE	1001	1015	Members, I rise in support of Assembly Bill 219 as a principle co-author. AB 219 will extend the prevailing wage delivery drivers working directly for ready mix concrete company which is how contractor drivers are currently compensated.
5800	Mayes	Chad	79	2cybSlRCgP0	1600	1609	So I'm just wondering if with the other members here, if it's appropriate, are there some things specifically that you think that could be placed in here that could get you there to get your support.
5801	Weber	Shirley	44	sxH5Xtvq9A4	323	332	The assumption is obviously, he's either a gang member in trouble, may not be, but you stopped him because you thought he was and that's a profiling that occurs.
5802	Block	Marty	59	6HZtMGIcYrk	1175	1194	Not just because of increased funding but because the direction we're going in terms of planning. How are we going to know next year or the year after, a few years down the road, if in fact the most targeted students, the English learners and the low-income students are getting better at the rate they should be under LCFF? Whoever.
5803	Williams	Das	12	HGSgNV57aUQ	166	179	The current conditions in IV have reached a breaking point, county government is not equipped financially to meet the many unique needs of such a densely populated urban area and a unique solution is needed.
5804	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	JwS_raJ5ApY	94	121	To ensure that we do have a robust debate though and a thorough discussion of the bill we are going to allow both the support and opposition to each have 15 minutes each side to testify. After the main support testimony has concluded, we will allow for individuals to come up to the microphones, state their name, their affiliation, and their position of support or opposition.
5805	Morrell	Mike	51	uymj8kL8SYs	264	286	Additionally, local governments remain concerned that the impact the fire fee will have on the ability to provide adequate fire protection. Most non-wild land fire protection is provided by local governments. This fee, however, makes it more difficult for local jurisdictions to pass or raise locally generated funding for protection.
5806	Stone	Jeff	26	6Q9j6EYWwEw	1004	1022	Fewer and fewer doctors right now are accepting MediCal patients which has been the topic of conversations on this floor in the past couple of days. It is estimated that 25% of the physicians in this state provide 80% of the services to MediCal patients.
5807	Allen	Benjamin	70	UMWTnjseXyo	993	1005	Both at the state and federal levels, the departments about the importance of addressing this issue? Are you, are you kind of getting a sense that people are starting to take it seriously, including veterans themselves?
5808	Beall	Jim	92	zZ5dG3yEymQ	1316	1340	That's the way it's done, and we should have the right attitude when we complete this work that we're gonna do during the special session. So, thank you all for being, and I got to meet with a bunch of Assemblymembers who want to talk to me about their bills so, I got about five or six of them lined up until about 7 o'clock today so I'll have to leave your meeting.
5809	Patterson	Jim	119	DaiegGG5yrM	1017	1035	The very fact that members of this body, as well as myself, we have written and called CARB repeatedly, to try and get some kind of an opening. We do a lot of constituent services work as a direct result of CARB.
5810	Chavez	Rocky	83	ElqG9zhDxtM	565	576	And, that only those family members who had an active participation in running the business would be eligible for entering into state contracts for a maximum of three years after the death of a veteran.
5811	Quirk	Bill	23	dJ6Is8ZeyoY	1440	1455	Thanks for your very optimistic statement and certainly we're optimistic here. The question we'll be asking, and certainly we'll be asking NRDC and EDF and other groups is what's the best way to get there?
5812	Garcia	Cristina	112	WgBOQU7UIHU	581	597	Actually, yeah, that would exclude him from that discussion. And so I think one of the amendments we have here that the committee brought that we're taking on was discussed in the opposition. Then they filled out the MOU. It's not strong enough or not good enough.
5813	Cannella	Anthony	61	YuFgB6EIE5U	332	349	We were kind of unbalanced there. So, we've got to understand, you know, what are we spending our money on it and I-- honestly I don't think I've-- I didn't really ask the question directly but if we want to know exactly why the increase has occurred, that should be information that's readily available.
5814	Bonta	Rob	85	vsNWmpwObU4	1104	1115	Are there comments or questions from committee members? Thank you for your comments and questions up to this point. Thank you for the robust discussion. At this point we'll go to Assembly Member Chiu. This is your opportunity to close.
5815	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	gZ0_qo7XpYk	552	579	This is why SB 180 brings all power plants under Emissions Performance Standard and gives the CPUC and CEC in consultation with the California Independent System Operator and the Air Resources Board. Again, all the agencies who were charged with meeting the slower reductions, it gives them the flexibility necessary to make sure California meets its climate goals while keeping the lights on it.
5816	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	ZurQFkaNhto	624	640	Unfortunately California school students often times don't have enough time to eat and miss out on the benefits of a good lunch. In poor Districts, like mine, school lunch sometimes is the only nutritious meal that a student has during the day.
5817	Wagner	Donald	88	oC8-KbPE6Yo	1708	1743	I will say we don't have the testimony here today, but the supporters of this bill talked about going and talking to the conservatee's lawyers and said well when we raised this issue with them, all of these advocates just laughed at us. And they took that as absolute outrage that someone would laugh at the idea of these folks voting.
5818	Hill	Jerry	66	ilwRLhZLtAc	155	164	Is there anyone else on the committee who would like to make a comment or statement this morning? Very good. Thank you, and thank you for being here so early in the morning.
5819	Fuller	Jean	49	LTEBLbyRjnQ	1118	1133	Because the definition for interscholastic after school program has come to mean so many things to so many people. It's a bit vague these days and some school districts aren't aware of their opportunity. This in no way requires them to do so.
5820	Thurmond	Tony	4	Msk4w8ZLEwc	888	900	Thank you. This concludes our, our discussion on the CalFresh programs. Moving on, then, the Department of Social Services, thank you very much, Ms. Anders, we have the Adult Programs.
5821	Mitchell	Holly	64	DwrMQLfFxcs	219	243	We will hear the developmental centers budget issues on Thursday, May 7th. We will hold these items open pending a review of the governor's May revise. Again, I told you about how we're going to take public testimony. With that, we'll open it up for the first panel to begin. Welcome. Oh, excuse me. Senator Stone?
5822	Liu	Carol	63	Uqg2olh0M7g	1990	2010	OK. Any other questions or comments for members? The bill has been moved. Thank you Senator Allen for bringing this forward. I do appreciate you're trying to settle out the incentive here and make LCFF and the appropriate programs work better.
5823	Thurmond	Tony	4	2b3SgDbb8jI	2092	2106	I want to thank the folks of UC Berkeley for having created a stakeholder process that will make recommendations about what the community benefits agreement will ultimately look like, and we respect that process. We think that this bill in this language speaks to intent.
5824	Leno	Mark	60	N5kRSRB-qaQ	225	252	The 21 juvenile products that are represented in this bill are not impacted by SB 1019 because they're not subject to the state flammability standard, which means that these 21 products, with which our youngest citizens have most daily contact, have been identified by the state not to be flame risks.
5825	Pavley	Fran	104	GkK_99mYtlc	1498	1507	I said, "Of course we're going to do an Oversight hearing on SB 4." So it was up to her to pull it off, and thank you Katharine, you did an excellent job.
5826	Garcia	Eduardo	38	dQgHkZmLQFo	1123	1144	As California moves towards renewable energy resources beyond 33% mandate and achieving the state's greenhouse gas goals, best fit attributes of renewable energy resources in addition to their total costs should be taken into consideration. In 2014, the California Independent System Operator reported four RPS curtailments due to over generation.
5827	Grove	Shannon	77	b2XLo4I9yzU	482	492	Thank you Mr. Chair, thank you for the this request. It's very interesting to me because I'm, I don't wanna say I'm obsessed with the developmental centers but I have a huge issue with them.
5828	Mitchell	Holly	64	SU8_KAMcIaE	766	788	One more question Mr. de Leon. SB 719 kind of created one of the slots that you're actually feeling that you've been appointed to, which is reserved for a practicing physician or research with expertise of health effects of air pollution. Given that expertise, given the role you play on the board as a whole, how do you think your role is different than other board members or is it?
5829	Bonta	Rob	85	h3qpDny4S5o	1446	1463	And I think what we're seeing through the Joint Hearing  that you participated in, I think it was the week before last i'm losing track maybe last week, is that we have a very broad coalition of supporters in the Legislature both Senate and Assembly Republican and Democrat for an increase in the provider rates.
5830	Hill	Jerry	66	7p8pDq5czTo	657	675	One is that they say that there's no discretion. Well, there's no discretion in having a location, but there is discretion in the school district in where that location will be, working with the charter school to try to determine the most appropriate place that works for everyone. And I think that's where the discretion lies.
5831	Weber	Shirley	44	7i9bh_kaYv0	582	592	And so, they send their kids to grandma for two weeks, or three weeks, or whatever. And so therefore, many districts don't engage in getting kids and as we talked about attendance truancy.
5832	Thurmond	Tony	4	iK2wNSKHbWs	1479	1490	And this is a way of employing community folks who can work with the parents, they get training around confidentiality, and it's been proven to be very effective in areas where there are high rates of chronic absenteeism.
5833	Stone	Jeff	26	w14C8IiFUpY	1482	1504	But, there's gotta be a way to get to the end game here, that we want to facilitate and help these people get back to work. And by the way, Michelle, I want to tell you how much I enjoyed your story and I applaud you for overcoming the many obstacles that you faced throughout your life. I wish you and your family Godspeed and God bless you for being here and thank you for your courage to come before us today.
5834	Hertzberg	Robert	99	Wt_ez7F9UlE	402	420	It simply amends section 231.5 of the code of civil procedure and just says,a party shall not use a peremptory challenge to remove a prospective juror on the basis of an assumption that the presumptive juror is biased merely because of a characteristic listed or defined in section 11135 of government code or similar grounds. Whatever similar grounds means.
5835	Stone	Jeff	26	2MXVIex_Zeg	1327	1337	And I'm sure we'll probably here from some counties today that this is just not enough. And so I was just curious if you saw any kind of disparity versus the rural versus urban counties.
5836	Stone	Jeff	26	0MzTgkt-Llc	1368	1395	Especially in a county that's urbanizing more, where we're adding more cities so they are getting more representation as more cities are planned and pursuing city hood in a county like mine, which has been historically the fastest-growing county in the State of California and in all likelihood will surpass San Diego county and Orange County in the next 10-15 years in population because that's where people are migrating.
5837	Beall	Jim	92	GE9yKeDoFKQ	2046	2060	Makes it simpler so that we save that money and put it back into services to allow these kids to be all day in the daycare program run by Kidango.
5838	Cannella	Anthony	61	SU8_KAMcIaE	1090	1106	I thought it was from the Bay Area, I'll continue to blame them.  You said it was from, maybe China blowing over, but regardless, it ultimately lands in the Central Valley and we are left dealing with the consequences of poor health, but also our higher employment.
5839	Leno	Mark	60	QKPlYzaLDfo	174	180	So if you're going to talk about one side of the equation, I would suggest that finance also be honest and talk about the other side of the equation as well.
5840	Mullin	Kevin	31	3iSH1uuuz-E	1420	1456	Thank you Mr. Frazier. Seeing no discussion or debate on this item, the clerk will open the roll. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. The clerk will close the roll, tally the vote. Ayes 44. Nos zero. Measure passes. The 1st Extraordinary Session is recessed under call of the Speaker.
5841	Morrell	Mike	51	bxDlgoZu0KI	1844	1865	This has been coined the literacy gap. Without this, basic computer and online functions, it will be very difficult for our students to demonstrate their true level of academic ability. So, we hope the use SB 318 to gauge what steps can be taken to help our students achieve greater success.
5842	Olsen	Kristin	15	tnNiyA_YijQ	437	447	California families, they're counting on us to come up with solutions, and I think last year we went a long way to demonstrate to people that we can have great
5843	Lara	Ricardo	107	ptq5V1Fu0ok	497	517	Five to two, that item is out. The next item is AB 30, do pass as amended to expand and clarify phase in of the new mascot. I'm sorry, the new school or mascot name. We will substitute the roll from AB 2. That bill is approved on a five to two vote, with Republicans voting no.
5844	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	fZNtPr5bhc4	605	621	I know early on the information that we got about hydraulic fracturing came from self-reporting, always a nerve wracking kind of notion that we have to rely on the largesse and the good will and the honesty of all our people.
5845	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	HgBIr1hupMw	602	615	If we can have these children starting off at the same starting point, we will need less and less of that remediation because what we find happening is our underserved kids come in to school. They're already behind. And they never catch up.
5846	Hertzberg	Robert	99	hp2WTRF5hkg	303	315	You know, the questions when we met were the 2 issues that, that I addressed in the bill because I thought that Mr Wetch was right. One is we don't want these, the billing go, to, to be offshored and let's make sure that the people who are doing the billing continue the billing. Fair call.
5847	Hall	Isadore	1	9eA3HqZp1ws	626	651	From Assembly Member Cheryl Brown's district. Please welcome Mr. Donald Griggs. Mr. Donald Griggs served as a military police in the United States Marine Corps and has developed a highly esteemed business and civic career in the Inland Empire. He's a trail blazer in his own right. Please welcome Mr. Donald Griggs.
5848	McGuire	Mike	93	Iras-GLDTWk	1555	1574	According to the US census, almost 70%, 70% of high school graduates in California, who graduate from a public high school, will not go on to receive a four-year college degree. And then we know that students require career, technical, and job skill programs to ensure they have the tools necessary to thrive in today's job market.
5849	Weber	Shirley	44	NTCK9Uu4-ME	895	912	So AB 854 seeks to one, align the Foster Youth Services program with local control funding formula to ensure the effective implementation of LCFF with students in foster care. It would also expand the Foster Youth Service eligibility criteria to all students who fall within the definition of foster youth as defined by LCFF.
5850	Hertzberg	Robert	99	Zz925hDmty8	546	570	As much as I'd like to accommodate, my sense of responsibility to the work of the Committee on the one hand and to the institution seems to me like there are other options and, to this deal. And we certainly have January and February and we have urgency bills and that we really have a compelling case to be able to, whether put a partial tax in the ballot if necessary, working out a financing deal with respect to real estate to make it work.
5851	Gallagher	James	108	AJJV4Jngl_c	1311	1326	However, the prerequisites in section eight of the bond make it very clear that these are eligible for funding under the chapter... Projects which the public benefits are eligible for funding under this chapter consist of only the following.
5852	Mendoza	Tony	52	g1KhSxf2FKA	66	82	Your second assertion that state telling local government what to do, again, inserting themselves. The state always does that. If something falls over, something doesn't work, they insert themselves and take over schools sometimes, school districts.
5853	Chau	Ed	116	0hkCdiDRiI0	486	505	Section 2706 of the ACA bans discrimination against whole classes of healthcare providers. Unfortunately, health plans and insurance companies commonly limit the types of healthcare providers are allowed to provide or deny reimbursement for services that the plan covers.
5854	Lara	Ricardo	107	hP3pxZDGmwM	759	776	It is important that we do look at this, but also understand that the LA County portion of the RMC is over 1,350 square miles. The Orange County part of it is 130 square miles. So we're trying to find some parity here.  Proportional.
5855	Chau	Ed	116	QoWDHxezaEY	1078	1100	But if the damages caused to, let's say a database or computer system per say, something that's digital, then existing law already addresses that, and if I could direct your attention to existing law, that is penal code 502c4 page 5 of the digest of lines 20 to 31. If I could read.
5856	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	Fotikfq9Ybo	1007	1017	So, yeah, I'm happy to answer that. And some of that's detailed in that letter but, in particular the real concern is: is this going to ground our air-fleet when we're fighting fire; our air-ops?
5857	Leno	Mark	60	JT1Tm7zEIWc	1683	1729	One last question then, and this might be for the chair of the Committee. Is there anything that precludes us from having another Labor Committee hearing? I didn't understand the answer, I'm sorry. So we could reconvene? Okay. All right. Senator Mitchell, it was a rhetorical question.
5858	Allen	Benjamin	70	vE1aI3Q_hng	543	575	And the court finally threw that entire financing system saying that we weren't offering equal protection to students based on the fact that they were growing up in a place of poverty, in a place where there was socio-economic disadvantage. So the question becomes, is this bill necessary to achieve a compelling state interest and the courts have said over and over again that the protection of public health is absolutely a compelling state interest. And they said that specifically with relation to vaccines.
5859	Wieckowski	Bob	55	gZ0_qo7XpYk	307	335	There's a motion by Senator Hill. It's my intention, Senator Galgiani to pen a letter to DST to explain my eagerness to have them actually go through and give us a report so we can now, we've had an oversight hearing sometime ago earlier today with DTSC so we want to let them know that we're interested in this. There's a motion. You may close.
5860	De Leon	Kevin	102	BHYxE3t9U1s	1851	1866	Those in support of the nomination of Mr. Gould, if you could be so kind of to come up and just identify yourselves and share a few words. Welcome.
5861	Stone	Jeff	26	perI44B8dbA	1145	1155	What I like to see is that there's a pervasive of manipulation of laws, that would get in the way of a public employee being gainfully employed. Again, I go back to myself being an employer. Where there's a number of pharmacy technicians that are, in fact, unionized.
5862	Hall	Isadore	1	w8RK3-qsxL8	172	190	So again wanna thank you for your leadership in this and, and all the work that you do. With regards to bringing, some, some unanimity in our country and, allowing our undocumented im, immigrants to, work, away and out of the shadows.
5863	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	iTrvWXqiedk	1804	1812	So did you provide Senator Huff with some of these traffic studies? If you don't have the data, and so have did those traffic studies, may I through the chair?
5864	Leno	Mark	60	Q3p12T-SoaE	56	73	And as much as I supported, I know there's bipartisan support for earned income tax credit in Congress, and that maybe Ronald Reagan might have said that it's one of the best poverty fighting programs that we have.
5865	Mayes	Chad	79	24W2oeMkjbI	1019	1031	According to the appropriations community analysis, any costs would be minor and absorbable. I'll close by noting that we received some poly concern, policy concerns yesterday. And I have a great respect for the member who brought them to my attention.
5866	Hill	Jerry	66	4tVR58n3Ljg	860	878	My God, that was wonderful. I think we agree. Thank you very much and thank you for being here. Thanks for the presentation and the best to you Miss Bello-Jones on your retirement. Hope you enjoy it and get to do a lot of the things that you'd like to do and have a great time and a lot of fun too.
5867	Gipson	Mike	28	r0_c68VZXFY	140	162	This resolution will seek to rewrite the narrative of civil unrest by addressing the foundation of injustice that led to the revolt and also celebrate the peaceful triumph that came out of the revolt that took place in August of 1965.
5868	Leyva	Connie	62	SM79vxJ_AdE	1370	1386	I just wanna say, I agree with Senator Bates that we want more people participating, absolutely. I think where probably we disagree a little is the first way to get them to participate is by having them register to vote. If people aren't registered to vote, then we have no hope of getting them to the polls.
5869	Hill	Jerry	66	ilwRLhZLtAc	2134	2149	So, I would hope that there was some response, perhaps if we could get to the allegations made in this article and the most recent ones. That would be good to hear, after you get a chance to look at those.
5870	De Leon	Kevin	102	8UaA3ArF3qo	1193	1215	Thank you very much, Miss Leyva. What were going to do now is open up for those who want to testify in support of your nomination those who want to very briefly, state your name and the reasons why you are in support. This again is those in support of the nomination of Miss Toche. Don't all rush to microphone at the same time.
5871	Bloom	Richard	2	ch3qK2_FbyA	142	167	fee waivers. Amendments taken in Appropriations Committee address cost concerns of the CSUs and community colleges. I remind you that California has the highest number of homeless youth in the nation. It is essential that we address the needs of this population and help them to access the education that will help them assure a brighter future. AB 801 has no opposition, and I urge your aye vote. Thank you.
5872	Hall	Isadore	1	rn8iMdWxrk0	370	388	In fact, 29 states current allow these types of raffles to be conducted at sporting events. SB 549 provides important consumer protections and increase enforcement and oversight by requiring a charitable organization that conducts 50-50 raffles to register, report, and pay fees to be regulated by the California Department of Justice
5873	Alejo	Luis	9	1ddkqgmLsnY	742	760	I do want to point out that in 2013 we did the last resolution, for the first-time in California history that bipartisan effort at the beginning of that session ended up with Republicans, fifteen of them, doing the first-ever republican only press conference in support of immigration reform.
5874	McGuire	Mike	93	LwhIfxRQ9VM	238	257	Saving them from a lifetime of dangerous side effects and other consequences. However, we continue to hear regularly from stakeholders in the child welfare system, that children routinely are not being provided the effective mental health services they need to heal from the traumatic experiences that led to their involvement in the child welfare system.
5875	McGuire	Mike	93	LwhIfxRQ9VM	217	238	And at our last hearing, and many of you were there, we heard testimony that these medications do not treat underlying trauma, but only the symptoms of untreated trauma. We also Learned that with consistent mental health services, provided at the right time, by the right clinicians, we can prevent the over-medicating of our foster youth.
5876	Pavley	Fran	104	nlURi31-KJY	899	908	which is out in the Santa Clarita Valley it's part of the 27th Senate district. They're an amazing college if you haven't been out there they have a workforce development center
5877	Nielsen	Jim	68	kjbtobUTSlE	1051	1067	some go back to DC and get caught up in the falderol and want to rise up in the leadership and devote so much of their attention to Washington DC, many tend to forget the folks back home. Don Clausen never did.
5878	Hueso	Ben	48	-PZnzyI1C5I	127	156	Okay. So we couldn't call it a 50/50 raffle because it wouldn't be legal to currently offer. So, I want to speak to somebody that has done a 90/10 raffle in the past. Is there anybody here present that has any experience in conducting a 90/10 raffle in relation, now, just so I understand, 'cause I see there's a lot of sports teams here, is this done with relations to a sports venue?
5879	Grove	Shannon	77	EmQFEn7-288	124	158	They had an inspector come in and in the infant care you have to be able to see infants at all times, at all times. Well, the way the cribs were set up in the room with a big glass window where you could see into the room, if you were not in the room, you could see into the room, the crib next to the window, right next to the window, you could only see half of the crib. And they were cited and fined and absorbent amount of money that was just absurd to the point where why didn't they just come in and go hey, this bed's like too close to the window, you should push it out a little bit so you can see the whole bed versus half the bed.
5880	De Leon	Kevin	102	lyKj6jnAr6Y	352	374	Just give us your general statement, and then from there, what we'll do is we'll dive in a little deeper. With that too, and I should have stated this a little earlier, but if there's any significant others, loved ones, friends, families that you'd like to introduce and they'd like to be recognized, please do so.
5881	Hernandez	Ed	103	DJsU22tiuNg	1655	1675	And I don??t think we should be putting the onus on the patient to figure out every single provider. If anything, and I hate to say this, maybe we should put the onus on the provider before they provide that service to notify the patient that they're not in-network, and then they can choose to, and then look for another provider.
5882	De Leon	Kevin	102	lyKj6jnAr6Y	315	333	I don't want to say those are my words, but if I could extrapolate if you will from the conversations that we have had, that I have had, with these three Senators, this is the conclusion that I come to.
5883	Pavley	Fran	104	-_4-MnSxShM	162	179	Bill Craven had mentioned that any cities are welcome to go to the Fish and Game and ask for, because of unique circumstances or challenges like that and you're right with 58 counties and different urbanization patterns in the proximity to urban interface,
5884	Brown	Cheryl	13	ejG5Ru6MX_o	1560	1586	Let me just ask one more thing. Whenever you start putting together the blue ribbon committee, please remember the people in the Inland Empire, because we generally get left out of these kind of things. And we are the ones that have the sunshine and the heat and all the things that go with that. So please make sure that somebody is representing the Inland Empire on that.
5885	Pavley	Fran	104	8m8Es5iF3dE	1828	1850	It's a huge potential zoning issue, let alone affordable housing kind of deterrent, so, I just wanted to share with you there is, Air BnB is making it more difficult for cities and frustrated and that's why people are up here today. To share that with us.
5886	Melendez	Melissa	41	mNQQzzy6ePQ	95	112	Simply put, AB150 would restore the penalties for gun trafficking and theft of a firearm to what they were prior to Prop 47. We know that criminals or one who steals a fun is not stealing it to go duck hunting, okay? They're stealing it probably to go people hunting or commit some other type of crime, and I think that's the type of activity we're trying to curtail in this state last time I checked.
5887	Nazarian	Adrin	36	RsqrHgBrOM8	1200	1217	Thank you for the questions, and thank you for allowing me to clarify. First of all, the locals do not. And so that's why we want the state authority to be extended to the locals. And for the first question I'll ask Mr. Schacht to answer.
5888	Thurmond	Tony	4	UMlpaC9VCt4	1084	1103	Thank you Mr. Chair, members. I'd simply say that it's rare that we have a bill where we all can agree that mental health services help kids. And it's very rare that we can do something that's all ready budgeted in the governor's May revision. In light of that fact, I would ask that you give me respectfully your aye vote on this measure.
5889	Bates	Pat	58	jsJrqv78Trc	989	1005	Combining the two and looking at the numbers, I think, tends to confuse us in terms of seeking solutions. What I think, it's absolutely a mandate for more social services to address those folks who've got these addiction problems and all the behavioral problems that go along with them.
5890	Leno	Mark	60	5oljCvpfO9A	1	29	Thank you Senator. We're going to move on to Senator Allen, and quick question from Senator Mitchell. We'll get to our second panel and keep in mind we all have a lot to share on all these subjects. Just that, the folks who are going to pay because of our inquisitive nature will be the public because there is a Committee hearing here at 1:30 so that's why we are watching the clock today. Senator Allen.
5891	Irwin	Jacqui	16	V2DWmVVPp4I	155	173	Alright, thank you very much gentlemen, and we are down to our last two speakers- Michael McNerney, a senior consultant with Delta Risk and Raj Shah, senior director for strategy at Palo Alto Networks. Good afternoon gentlemen.
5892	Frazier	Jim	114	3Luw7tOrBzg	721	741	And I appreciate that, and I think those are all worthy steps moving forward. I think my biggest concern is that there is a funding issue that could be considered a conflict of interest and I'd like to look at that going forward to make sure that you actually have the ability to distance yourself from people that you are accrediting that are paying for the accreditation.
5893	Cooley	Ken	45	NNzDQCiG5UU	1299	1318	It's about sort of the fleeting nature of life. The evenesence of life that life can be like a ripple that appears in a pond you haven't thrown a stone, there is no breeze, but a ripple appears and then it's gone. In this song, and he actually asked that the lyrics be read to remember him so I'll take permission read in a moment.
5894	Block	Marty	59	Kn6sMDlpJKs	525	543	Sometimes a 100 students in a class that had 30 seats, and these were classes a student needed to graduate, a student needed to take additional sequence classes because these were prerequisite classes, and yet they couldn't get the classes so they couldn't graduate in four years, or five years, or sometimes even in six years.
5895	Chavez	Rocky	83	y1QKa01q6Wg	2193	2208	What's gonna happen is before, where you have the person who needed a medicine to the person who provided the medicine. Now in between them, you have insurance agencies are telling where you're going, and you have doctors less flexibility.
5896	Irwin	Jacqui	16	TmtzANXYgv0	1326	1340	A recent charity fraud case by the Attorney General brought to light inadequacies in the current law. And I think we've already read about it and would anybody else like to?
5897	Weber	Shirley	44	uuwAxYppIw8	777	806	We have worked extensively on this bill since December. It was a huge bill that we honed down to be the bill that it is. We've given part parts of other pieces that you'll see, and to the, to the other authors who have other things dealing with privacy and Public Records Act and those kinds of things that will be coming in other bills. And so we appreciate the Chair's effort to include some of those in limited form. In this bill, so that we know that there's some concern about it. We will, we will work on this bill.
5898	Campos	Nora	76	EvD39W6YJ0A	1482	1493	I think I'm fortunate that my son, the substitute teachers he's had in his class have been up to par. So, he hasn't missed a beat. But I hear your comment, thank you for that comment.
5899	Pan	Richard	96	qMylnhtxSF8	1532	1567	That is, it's the professional challenge of the physician in terms of what they believe, that if the risk of the immunization is gonna be such that it's going to put that child at certain or, near, basically increased harm. Then they can provide that exemption. And so, that's to the judgment of actually any licensed physician in the state of California. There's no requirement that you even have to go to a physician that you've seen multiple times in the past.
5900	Levine	Marc	8	knpBhgRlo8Q	522	537	And, that we can plan for our future with those parks, rather than throwing money at the parks. And I think that your commission has had the opportunity for us to revisit this and figure out, well how do we create the parks that we want for future?
5901	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	maPB0VHfdFQ	1670	1707	Mr. Speaker in honor of aerospace week, I'd like to take this opportunity to introduce two people here, two gentlemen who are very involved in the aerospace industry Mr. Steve Siterac, the Manager of Public Policy and Government relations at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronomics, and Mr. Bill Barado the California chapter Vice President of the American Society of Aeronautics. We welcome you gentlemen.
5902	Hancock	Loni	98	uXz3rsRgsuA	8	41	And our first items are information only. The hearing, we have a number of population proposals. We have issues related to the Coleman v. Brown ongoing court cases. But we're going to begin with a discussion of the recent audit on the sex offender evaluation program conducted by the state hospitals.
5903	Monning	Bill	25	UpjsW9YiW28	793	820	this product is US because we hold it to a higher standard, we're putting ourselves at a competitive disadvantage, not just with other countries, but with other states. So we have 49 other states that allow their manufacturers to say made in the USA, with less than 100% content.
5904	Vidak	Andy	56	5cbDr55Nnpw	1110	1122	With a new congressional session called into session early last month, it's important that this Legislature call on the Congress and the President to work together to reform our immigration system and replace it with one that works.
5905	Wood	Jim	72	llrxaJMn6L0	699	708	So that is a conversation that I look forward to the opportunity to continue some of that. And I do appreciate where you're coming from. I really, really do.
5906	Hancock	Loni	98	m65WWf8IMs4	715	737	I do have some additional questions. I think I really want to associate myself with Senator Leyva's remarks that this has been a learning experience for all of us, because we've really needed to dig into the issue, and I feel like I've learned a lot about it.
5907	Leno	Mark	60	gB0SqdP0x6o	681	709	If we could integrate, and those programs are so successful and, I've been to some of the graduations they're very powerful and moving experiences. And these people are sincere in their own reformation that if we could somehow integrate the spirit of those programs into our drug treatment programs because so much of it is just about psychology and, what inner demons folks are dealing with that there could be some synergy between the two ...
5908	Hueso	Ben	48	PLWNz_3ZqZQ	932	946	Anything that we can do to our state government to create a public forum and to provide input and to create a debate and have that result into a public policy change, we need to be fiscally prudent.
5909	Hernandez	Ed	103	fUpA9iRHn2E	867	890	Thank you. Any questions from any of the members? I have a couple questions. I mean obviously in your opening statement you'd mentioned that there was certain areas that had a higher incidence of fraud, and I'm assuming from that information you gathered, that you determined that it was these three entities. Is that correct?
5910	Kim	Young	82	HdobNWq7f3c	1421	1441	The implementation of EMV is already in place is it not? Could you speak to that, the success of it, and as you're doing the implementation process is there any hindrance and where is it coming from?
5911	Stone	Jeff	26	Ea-UVDMoM1k	156	174	We need to have public noticing of meetings, and what we're going to be discussing. And again, Mr. Chair, I do not hold you responsible for this. Others are making decisions to jam this final budget package through with as little scrutiny as possible. I believe you would've kept your commitment, if it was up to you.
5912	Quirk	Bill	23	i3P-QI4InjM	1408	1419	Of course we will incorporate that. Thank you very much for pointing that out and I'm more than happy to make sure that amendment is taken care of, and I guarantee it.
5913	Nielsen	Jim	68	1XQMI2ofb7Y	1303	1317	In terms of where we're headed with this budget and entreat our subcommittees to exercise very rigid oversight and the concept of zero based budgeting self-imposed in each committee.
5914	Allen	Benjamin	70	QnBcTK-as8k	121	134	Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman and the members of the committee. Election day voter registration will commence in California in 2017, following the implementation of our new statewide voter database.
5915	Cooper	Jim	21	C3fC_QKuL0U	166	184	The responsibility to speak out against crime and advocate for our victims, strengthening the family unit and doing their part to improve living conditions within their neighborhoods. Without all partners faithfully engaged in efforts to restore this wounded relationship, crime will prevail and grow.
5916	Hueso	Ben	48	20R5DjZ86C8	1531	1574	So thank you again for your service here to our community. Thank you all for what you're doing. I wanna thank all our staff here today for their preparation in this Committee, for Jay Dickinson, India Baptista, Melody Gutierrez, and- Kerry Ishida. Kerry Ishida. Thank you. Thank you for hanging in with us in this long meeting. So, we'll wrap it up today and we'll adjourn the meeting. Thank you.
5917	Pan	Richard	96	w3MaeL9rUCE	1261	1276	Also as someone who is an educator myself, I was in charge of the residency training program UC Davis for pediatrics and, you think about the rate at which medicine has traveled and thinking about how computers, its actually interesting.
5918	Leno	Mark	60	J-efxTqVOiQ	1448	1469	Thank you. So, again, of all the many cuts that have been made in recent years, Senate subcommittee felt that this was a top priority given the impacts on nutrition and infections, and all of the resulting problems with lack of access to adult dental benefits.
5919	Cooley	Ken	45	6qpSAuN2om0	1199	1227	What I will say is that the EDD worked with the Chambers. We're kind of looking at that issue just sort of implementation issues. This is not a system that actually that involves great elaborate software. To an extent they do it off a link of the EDD website, but this is an issue that is part of the one issue that we're working with.
5920	Obernolte	Jay	86	z_nb3rZYxjo	84	99	So, I apologize, there's not really a question built onto this, but I want to give you an opportunity to kind of defend that, why you think that this requirement kind of trumps the competing interest of keeping housing affordable?
5921	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	MO4QFekCxFk	478	495	So I'm not gonna be able to support this bill today. I look forward to continuing to work with you on a holistic, comprehensive approach to ensuring that our children are healthier. And I hope that we will find a more progressive structure in California to start ensuring that these programs can be paid for.
5922	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	jjB76hKrhNA	1993	2014	Thank you, Senator Mendoza. And on behalf of the entire body here, please accept our condolences on this very inexplicable loss. Okay, well, that's I think about it for today. If there is no other business, and there appears to be none. I'm sorry, Senator Berryhill.
5923	Rendon	Anthony	120	5Qw_YsDfvQ4	1358	1377	Having been termed out last June, he moved to Los Angeles to see if you might contribute in some way to our state's policy and political dialogue. John grew up in Michigan, but like so many he was inspired by all the great things that our state has accomplished in leading the nation on so many critical issues.
5924	Hancock	Loni	98	HZbl-R6159E	1346	1377	Thank you. I do have a couple of questions about the categories on page four. Because as I was reading through the categories I was noticing some information that I think we need. I would certainly want to use in making decisions, that aren't there.
5925	Hancock	Loni	98	Oc8_cozASuQ	520	565	And that isn't necessarily the best way to conduct independent investigations. But that there would be required to be preliminary hearings that are open and adversarial with both sides having a chance to present evidence. Or perhaps an independent agency. Those are two different alternatives. And, I don't know if Officer Durant, that you have thoughts on that. Mr. Esposito.
5926	Hernandez	Ed	103	OACKM5KF8Sk	191	202	And then I have a follow-up question on the procedures that were given to the individuals that are deceased. I dont know if you can answer that, the first part.
5927	Roth	Richard	106	osLFdvvw3yM	510	538	Let's require a report back to this subcommittee and its staff by March 1 of 2016 with respect to the utilization of the positions that we are in the process of approving, so we can keep track of this, and then certainly to the extent that the technical and support services positions need to be adjusted, we'll expect a negative BCP at the two year point.
5928	Wood	Jim	72	5EeaivfMcyY	1555	1575	Just a follow up. It just feels like this is really, it should be more of a discussion about how to regulate the business model. It feels like something went, it sort of a feels like we didn't really like the court decision and that this is an opportunity to take a really punitive approach to force somebody out of the market.
5929	Gatto	Mike	46	-OpN4Uo7BxE	216	230	Thank you. Mr. Speaker. You know, the whole purpose behind H1B Visa program was to import workers only when an American worker couldn't do the job. When a company abuses that, when that type of thing happens, it's a serious blow to our workforce.
5930	Wieckowski	Bob	55	eGYOhkRkhDU	112	142	So there's ten items on today's file. Item number six for everyone here, the switch is AB 23, or 323, by assembly member Olson is on consent. And with that I'd like to convene the oversight hearing with DTSC and welcome the DTSC director Barbara Lee. Good morning Director Lee. And welcome members.
5931	Rodriguez	Freddie	69	9P0OZVf3kdQ	437	447	Just a quick question. I'm looking to support the bill but, so would this be something in conjunction to a DNR, correct, or a little bit more meat, so to speak, more information.
5932	Hernandez	Ed	103	OACKM5KF8Sk	178	191	Cause, I seem like a lot of the, dental providers are pretty busy as it is and how do we fill that void? You know, other than just making employment times longer for all patients as a whole. So I don't know you can answer that at all.
5933	Bonta	Rob	85	cVvEnGhVv_c	230	251	So the targeting and the importance of disaggregation is very important to uncover potential disparities and I think it's absolutely important to address all types of disparities, whether be education or economic opportunity, equal justice. And that work is happening this year in a lot of different ways.
5934	Maienschein	Brian	84	UqQcd0TyhPE	922	929	It was not just particular to my council district because so many other people had to be evacuated even though their homes weren't destroyed. They had to be evacuated.
5935	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	6plsq34lldk	240	261	- And thank you for your testimony. My question's just a little bit different. You're an African American male who's within the system that's dealing with your colleagues, your law enforcement officers. And I know there's a code of silence and I know there is this thing where you don't basically rat out another fellow officer.
5936	De Leon	Kevin	102	jjB76hKrhNA	425	452	and available to all individuals. Again, Ms. Bui as well as Mr. Kurylowicz are Governor appointees, specifically for the Commission of Peace Officer Standards and Training, that is post. And Ms. Wittenberg, as well as Ms. Yanez are for State's and Parks' recommendation.  4-0, Rules Committee, no opposition, bipartisan. I respectfully ask for an aye vote.
5937	De Leon	Kevin	102	jjB76hKrhNA	389	407	California. File item number 1 also includes Diane Wittenberg, as well as Elva Yanez. These are two appointees for the Governor's State Parks and Recreation Commission. Ms. Wittenberg has over 27 years of experience working on climate change and
5938	Hancock	Loni	98	670ewxdSqNM	998	1018	Well, the email that you quoted, sounded like a college-educated person talking about how to get the money from less educated and vulnerable people. That should just be, that's fraud, isn't it?
5939	Roth	Richard	106	8epuGfrU4TQ	1158	1176	Well, what do you do when I file my tax returns and I attach a 1099? Or my tax preparer takes my 1099s and plugs the numbers into my return because I'm sure they don't ignore the number.
5940	Allen	Benjamin	70	xngdjnDcNKI	2127	2139	this is a process that's moving forward with a lot of excitement but also with some trepidation in areas that we need to continue work on and look at. So thank you so much everyone. And we'll now get to caucus thank you.
5941	Mathis	Devon	75	mYMmmzreoTQ	1402	1412	I'm just curious as to what are your thoughts with like Telecare and those things with new technologies moving forward, where you can talk to a doctor face-to-face over your computer or your phone.
5942	Weber	Shirley	44	v8EYhSKM6wc	338	364	Mr. Thurmond, I appreciate your, your question and your comments. You probably know I've, I've spent the last 40-some-odd years as an educator who has been and out of schools and in and out of systems almost my entire life. I would never ever develop an evaluation system based on one indicator.
5943	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	Y1vJCPBhcQM	1399	1407	That's a great question, and I'm not sure I can answer that, but that's one that, it's not spelled out in the law, but its going forward from what I'm hearing from.
5944	Block	Marty	59	ckveUQ3Zvdc	264	276	Mr. Chair, with your indulgence SB 538 has recently been amended. And a couple members of the committee have told me they haven't had time with their staff to digest the amendments yet.
5945	Wieckowski	Bob	55	N5YEVBe8-2M	785	836	So, I think that there's work to be done in improvement.   The Legislature has been, has looked critically at the problems that are occurring in all the departments and the different programs and is attempting to help address them in the process of these oversight hearings.  We approve budget augmentations and we sent legislation to the Governor, as referenced by Senator Lara,  aimed at correcting the course of this broken agency and, under the leadership of former Director Debby Rafael, these plans were developed and we've had some initial steps, but it's our role as the Legislature and as the oversight to, picking up the term of them morning, get into the weeds as far as addressing what the department needs to do to reform.
5946	Rodriguez	Freddie	69	gdqTdEZLl0I	2198	2207	I mean, at least you'd have some type of care there, then obviously get the community involved in, your closest hospital is up or down the road, I'm not sure where it is from that location, so without.
5947	Pavley	Fran	104	4MjmF7EnXtg	2080	2108	I note the presence of assembly member Levine, it's AB 549. It's on state parks. And there's no formal opposition to this measure. And there are amendments on pages four and five. Which the author is accepting.
5948	Chavez	Rocky	83	rKOC2CSv6h0	653	666	Okay, so now that we've established that Covered California does not have a contracted procedure to go ahead A contract. Now as you, as the Department of Finance. Are you telling the legislative body that your
5949	Gomez	Jimmy	80	9mjyTPfbhPw	1092	1113	not being able to really tell him that he only had a few months to live. That ended up being my responsibility. So I've seen this play out. But one of the things that I've always understood is that we have to try to relieve people's suffering throughout their life.
5950	Mitchell	Holly	64	6uURceuzWYc	395	419	I appreciate you, sir. And when I look at the Welfare Directors Association chart, I don't feel very successful in my efforts but I'm going to keep on trucking. I want to thank everyone  who participated today, of course the director, for staying here and having the full experience. I appreciate you for doing that always.
5951	Grove	Shannon	77	3I7f3vKVAeA	688	702	Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong opposition to this bill. I listen to debate on this floor constantly, and you're always talking about the poor and impoverished and underserved communities, you don't think this bill is going to affect the poor, underserved, and impoverished communities?
5952	Allen	Benjamin	70	mTcFXIImlIA	741	757	And, he's my hero, he's lived an incredibly fulfilling, engaging, wonderful life, and yet I saw first-hand, almost every step of the way growing up with him, living with him, celebrating him, the debilitating impact of this disease.
5953	Mitchell	Holly	64	m25jL11Z0rE	666	683	Conditions such as astigmatism, convergence problems, also known as the ability to move the eyes in where to focus, binocular vision which is how well the eyes track and work together, accommodation issues, the ability to focus on objects at a distance, to name a few.
5954	Bloom	Richard	2	HsL2PuGY_BI	781	798	Thank you. Welcome Director Bonham and before you begin, I'll just remind everyone that this is an informational hearing only. There's no action that we need to take, but we'll take questions for Miss Bosler or Director Bonham as soon as you finish Mr. Bonham.
5955	Wood	Jim	72	X-EMNVy0KVE	1408	1430	Currently the typical formulations of Oxycontin are very easy to crush between spoons. I, I demonstrated that recently. You could then snort that. You could liquefy it, and inject it. And the high is immediate. So I'm not trying to, I, I fully recognize that you could overdose by taking more pills, but that's not the way this drug is really being abused by our young people.
5956	Gipson	Mike	28	TtbWmbg1NYI	96	108	With me here today are individuals who will speak regarding this bill. In support of this bill, we have a representative from the disability rights of California. Ms. Connie Arnold.
5957	Moorlach	John	4657	JK2AAP7nJZs	945	955	Thank you, Madame President. I'm just reviewing the bill and it looks like it could decrease general fund revenue by 15 to $20 million a year. Is that accurate?
5958	Grove	Shannon	77	-Bv1QTsnUc8	1066	1079	So, it appears to me that there is a bad actor inside the Virtual Charter School Association, namely the Virtual Charter Academy. Is that the name of the organization? That is not, what is it?
5959	McGuire	Mike	93	qbDN-8u61LI	146	159	And this is a rare concentration of an industry, and it brings both benefits, as well as incredible challenges to our mutual communities, and especially to our environment. Challenges that we are tasked to help solve this year.
5960	Alejo	Luis	9	P6cBeme--dw	479	501	In fact when I got married two-and-a-half years ago, he couldn't even attend our wedding because the VA had sent him to the hospital to get a bone marrow transplant that took two months. A few days after visiting him, he had lost so much weight, lost all this hair. He was in a lot of pain.
5961	Pan	Richard	96	fNOTPzEYh_E	1295	1316	And it's being, I mean I think what, what you should be saying to all of us, and it is for us to decide here in terms of looking at this bill is that, are you willing to take on more risk in exchange for frankly, having the probability of putting less.
5962	Dababneh	Matthew	50	tC7sJemEjBU	1666	1681	The only criteria that's listed here is health and suitable. The universities still hold the only voice in determining whether or not these animals are healthy enough for adoption. We have not created some new committee, advisory board, panel.
5963	Hill	Jerry	66	S6YY-GQzZtQ	1039	1052	6-1? 6-2.  We'll hold the roll over for the absent members. Item number, would be the consent calendar. Item number eight and item number 15. Please call the absent members.
5964	Thurmond	Tony	4	gvsFAuMIegs	1964	1989	We hear you, we believe you and as the Senator has said, the special session is our opportunity to work together there. Thank you. To the Chair, I just had a question for the representatives from the Restaurant Association and the manufacturing. I appreciate what you had to say. Your graph was very helpful to see the increases.
5965	Hueso	Ben	48	RuFiLUXgjss	185	209	In an alternative scenario, a judge could say, you know, that to protect the victim that there is-- there would have to be a court. You know, he would basically take the same role but in a jury it could necessary make the jury feel that the attacker is already guilty.
5966	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	iSM5Bpt31OQ	358	371	Five to one, that bill is out. Next is SB 647 by Senator Morrell. Real Estate Investments. The motion is, do pass to Senate appropriations. Moved by Senator Anderson. Please call the roll.
5967	Leno	Mark	60	EvXJx3b_7-s	1544	1555	Thank you. So, moving on to the California State University on page thirty-five, we have the CSU funding package. I'm going to ask Mr. Costantouros to walk us through it.
5968	Mathis	Devon	75	ITEaoTWbk6c	1311	1332	We have to work together. We have to help our communities. This goes across the state, this isn't just small towns, this isn't just the central valley members. I represent the small town of east side Porterville. This is my home town.
5969	Block	Marty	59	_QWOBYYvqfo	1051	1071	 And, and, you know, understanding Senator Morlock's concern that we are losing funding for transportation, we need to look at how we better, how we better fund our freeways, our, our, our transportation corridors, but I, I would suggest the way to do it is, is not by stunting the growth of electric vehicles.
5970	Lara	Ricardo	107	tHDAU5JmwzE	1734	1752	SB 286, electricity direct transactions. Due pass as amended to specify that the eight gigawatt hour expansion is the state-wide total, and must be provided by 100% renewable sources. This is a roll call vote. Secretary call roll.
5971	Leno	Mark	60	k_l5daYZc00	1967	1982	Thank you, Ms. Bosler. LAO, before you review the legislative proposal. Could you give us a brief history of childcare and prop 98 just so we have some foundation to begin the conversation.
5972	Grove	Shannon	77	-Bv1QTsnUc8	1081	1098	California Association Virtual Academy. So, if there's one bad actor, I would hate to think that the legislature would not prohibit parents and freedom of choice in having these things. If there's a bad actor, then we need to go after the bad actor.
5973	Levine	Marc	8	nsi_dMaCc9g	1338	1355	And at this point in time, I'm not sure that this is when we want to be limiting their ability to do their job. So I unfortunately have to oppose the bill. But, I believe there was a motion already on the floor made, and a second. So we'll go and, oh, would you like to close, Mr. Bigelow?
5974	Liu	Carol	63	wxAms1gWFJA	942	960	And so-- And so we're trying to respond. The legislator should try to respond to that and this is a vehicle to do that. So this is a continuing conversation and hope it doesn't go too long but we have, you know, it can go on to the next spring because it doesn't have to get from the ballot till October-- I mean in November of 2016 if then.
5975	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	HU5u3bnal2k	403	428	excuse me, it also limited the offense of dealing without a license to handguns. The California chapters of the Brady campaign to prevent gun violence as well as several law enforcement agencies are in support of this bill. It is vital that we protect our communities by reducing unnecessary gun violence and particularly from those who are known to have
5976	Melendez	Melissa	41	7f5uDPxTBXo	1640	1648	I mean I don't understand why they're opposed to it being a felony for it being a GVRO.  Thank you Mr Chairman. I respectfully ask for your I vote.
5977	Chavez	Rocky	83	P8Zs2L1mwlY	1184	1197	I thought we were going to talk about, you know, activity based costs, and refined efficiencies, and then we went off into this To this, you know, what was that, what's that analogy. On a trip to Abilene we found out we didn't get to Abilene, we got to Chicago.
5978	Wagner	Donald	88	hrVBNy8V670	1805	1819	My question to you is am I missing anything or are there other differences? Is there something else to be said to allay the chairman's concerns about the two bills and moving them both forward out of this committee?
5979	De Leon	Kevin	102	oE98JCD72Xk	591	619	In fact, Los Angeles County is the largest manufacturing hub, not in the region, but in fact in the entire country. We have also, too from the Los Angeles Times, and I'll give a copy to everyone, California tops other states in job growth, but specifically with regards to manufacturing. We have the empirical data, and we can spell out the methodology also too
5980	Chiu	David	7	Bf9_WjQyNCc	1248	1264	Okay. Thank you, and then to Mr. Lee. First I want to thank you, I know that the LGBT caucus head requested that Covered California begin to collect this data, and you had referenced in one of your slides some of the work you're doing in that area. I was trying to decipher the language that slide and,
5981	Beall	Jim	92	tr961U921gU	164	179	All right, those of us in the legislature, who follow and care about housing issues are very aware of the serious shortage of quality and affordable housing, particularly for low-income individuals.
5982	Pan	Richard	96	YFmVbaB_4iY	407	427	And that's 95% for measles, to prevent the disease from spreading throughout the community, known as community immunity or herd immunity. And that is why every state in the United States including California, has passed laws requiring vaccination for school entry to protect our children and our community.
5983	Anderson	Joel	57	ZM99l_dNJfs	1761	1781	of state doesn't have this published on a website for all to see. Because if I see that 99% of votes are being counted that, that encourages me to vote because I know my vote gets counted. When people play hide the pea then I'm thinking, gosh, I just don't know if my votes are being counted, I'm kind of busy, the kids are late,
5984	Gray	Adam	27	I3UDrUF-FOU	727	745	Please make those available to my office, thank you. Any other public testimony at this time? Seeing none. I want to once again thank all of the folks who made themselves available for testimony, and to be here to hear this important discussion.
5985	Garcia	Eduardo	38	9aoEJ21mmKA	1574	1597	As I mentioned, the committee is the Salton Sea Restoration with renewable energy playing a key role. That is the title of this committee, and we are gonna keep the conversation focused on that. We believe that the energy industry in Imperial County can play a vital role in the restoration efforts of the sea.
5986	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	FVQ4YG_BqFE	1679	1709	Very briefly. First, I wanna thank you and the committee for assisting us in this matter. This is another response to this incident that occurred on May 19th. We've had a lot of conversation about this. We'll continue to work with you on this. But basically what we have discovered is that we have not been inspecting these pipelines regularly enough.
5987	Monning	Bill	25	Ynfh3sF9xbU	432	462	What the law provides is that we can in an advance directive ask for the end of medical support with a do not resuscitate or do not artificially feed, which may go counter to some of the statements made by some of the physicians that their duty is to maintain life regardless of the patient's circumstance is we have existing law in California where a patient's autonomy and advance directive can direct a physician not to extend life.
5988	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	akOKQetVqu4	44	57	Do you have a position or have you ever been a part of conversations about campaign finance and resources that are allocated toward turnout and the like and the strictures that we currently have in our systems?
5989	Mitchell	Holly	64	cXnV6IOLWSg	908	935	Aye's 32, no's 4. The measure passes. Moving on file item 60, AB 13907. Senator Beall, pass on file. File item 61, AB 813. Pass on file. File item 62, AB 1544.
5990	Huff	Bob	105	iJc5cTYtc4Q	1320	1334	That may be a hugely important thing at the time. It may cost us $1 now but $4 to repair what was $1 one year. Because you know if pavement in roads deteriorates so quickly, it's geometric, it's not linear.
5991	Gomez	Jimmy	80	ZTmIOC6QJLc	1188	1208	I told them, I don't tend to coauthor bills, because I don't know what's going to be the final product. But I did mention that even if people are coauthors, they reserve the right to change their mind along the process. And you witnessed that today with one of our colleagues who had some concerns and stated the concerns and actually asked for an Amendment.
5992	Grove	Shannon	77	2cybSlRCgP0	1279	1288	So we'll follow the same plan, we'll institute that language in the bill to show that the same planned closure would be in effect that had been used to close the previous facilities.
5993	Hernandez	Roger	37	5jUUOwMdhxk	1062	1089	I'm a little disturbed by the fact that I see members of my family, cousins, aunts, now having to spend less time with us when the Thanksgiving holiday comes forth, when the Christmas holiday comes forth, because some of these family members are in retail and they now have added pressures to be away from families. That breaks up family togetherness, and that, to me, is important.
5994	Hancock	Loni	98	UpKpxYjD9F8	398	409	Yeah, I just wanted to ask a question. Did you say that the-- although the contracts will be bargained-- locally, that the elements in the bargaining system cannot be bargained away?
5995	Williams	Das	12	WR_bP6j3vkM	432	456	While she's getting up, we'll make a couple announcements. There are two items that have been pulled from today's hearing, item 12, AB 720 by Cooley and item 39, AB 1500 by Maienschein. There are three bills proposed for consent, AB 824 by Gato, AB 1169 by Gomez, and AB 1420 by Salas. Is there a motion for the consent?
5996	Allen	Travis	43	AW7ZOJRT_Sc	311	335	AB 997 would take advantage of this opportunity by restating California's policy goal to provide that not less than seventy five percent (75%) of solid waste generated be source-reduced recycled, anaerobically digested, used for electricity generation, or composted by the year 2020 and annually thereafter.
5997	Frazier	Jim	114	3E-PSUGxVAY	1617	1632	So, now I'm going to move back into public comment and any members of the public who would like to share wisdom at this time. Seeing none moving up towards that arena.
5998	Hancock	Loni	98	kIQkyQM4CnQ	782	803	And also older women. There are many, many older women, in particularly Chowchilla, and Senator Bell and I have seen them sitting at their sewing machines making American flags.
5999	Huff	Bob	105	w3MaeL9rUCE	94	103	You know, it was multiple guess as we used to call and I would argue there was some critical thinking as I wasn't even taught the algebra that was in there at the time.
6000	Levine	Marc	8	hTPaXL_VY8w	1250	1265	And I think that there is a clear line between free speech and hate speech. There is the sharing of ideas that challenges who we are, and there is intimidation, and making people feel like they're not safe on campus.
6001	Allen	Travis	43	AW7ZOJRT_Sc	294	311	So given the difficulties in separating specific plastics for recycling and the inability to achieve economical price points that would successfully drive this enterprise, there's a window for us take advantage of new and emerging methods to support recycling and energy conservation efforts.
6002	Leno	Mark	60	F-p1mvX3SdQ	101	116	You think there's anything premature about this? I understand that the Conservation Corps is proposing to evaluate the entirety of the residential facility's expansion. That we might wait for what they have to say, I think, on January before we make any further decisions.
6003	Mitchell	Holly	64	d16C5zYyC-4	1563	1573	Thank you very much Senator De Leon. I want to thank you all for our lively conversation. You know, I knew your face and I didn't connect you from redevelopment until you said it, then I looked, that's where I know her from.
6004	Chau	Ed	116	kAZMIWno7zI	1718	1736	And, also the fact that they should have the option of having the information deleted when the information is not needed anymore. So, a combination of those things would probably help a little bit to alleviate the problem. I think we're going to continue to see a lot of these approaches.
6005	Mitchell	Holly	64	dCf0VaDDxwk	815	836	And reality is actions that community members, community leaders are being forced to take. The leader of STEP issued a letter to her local regional center, June 19th. Stating that she was no longer able to accept referrals. This is an organization that has successfully placed residents from developmental
6006	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	OIbMOKdbCjk	425	448	And Denise Ducheny with whom the strength of her understanding of the budget help newbies like me recognize that the budget is also a moral document as well as a financial one. And of course Sharon Runner who we expect will be coming back at some point, also a strong voice on behalf of the issues that are so important to us as women.
6007	Mitchell	Holly	64	LrUb6Z3dcdU	575	590	Director Xavier why don't you go ahead into your second item which is the overview of the traumatic brain injury program and then will include the fuller answer, if that is okay with you Senator Stone, in your presentation the BCP item #4.
6008	Levine	Marc	8	hTPaXL_VY8w	1233	1250	There's one thing about really intolerant people going to college and doing really bad things. But, there's a sense to me, no matter what the student group that's feeling this intolerance, that there's organized intolerance on our college campuses.
6009	Galgiani	Cathleen	95	fSCMT0VJDKw	1816	1840	It was national news, and again, it won't be the first community. We've, luckily, made an arrangement with South San Joaquin Irrigation District so that, in lieu of Byron Bethany Irrigation District providing water to Mountain House community, these 47,000 residents can get water on an emergency basis, negotiated with the state and with the water district.
6010	Mitchell	Holly	64	0QEuIEsELpg	927	939	I think it does suggest that the state should mandate coverage for them, given the long term cost effectiveness, and given the increase in access to services for those in rural parts of the state, all over the state.
6011	Fuller	Jean	49	aItBzVMycEU	575	604	There approximately 120,000 electric vehicles on the road voluntarily today, which is a good thing. It would take 13 million electric vehicles to replace 50% of the gas and disel we now use. That's a 130% increase in electric vehicles. Since 2012, California has spent 125 million to subsidize the purchase of 59,000 electric vehicles, which is half of those on the road.
6012	Stone	Jeff	26	U5tNwb5MlsY	476	490	California is 11 trillion gallons away from recovering from this drought. So, we have to have a lot of rain fall. And the issue of storage is very important and was a part of this bond.
6013	Maienschein	Brian	84	QmHhObaXRjg	1379	1401	When you talk about, there's 10% of waste can be attributed to breaks. Generally speaking, there's two kinds. There's the ongoing one that's not addressed, but there's also the sudden and unexpected one, which I think is a little bit what Ms. Waldron was getting at, which is it could break within a billing cycle.
6014	Quirk	Bill	23	UdyJhNk-vh8	557	590	No, no, no. No. And that's one of the things that I think is misunderstood. This would strictly be setting the policy. And let me just read section four. Yeah, I see the section we'll make it very clear that this is just to set a policy. I can understand why the Sheriffs would be very concerned if it had to be every time it was used, that would clearly be unworkable.
6015	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	hYh0N-NJMx0	561	577	Is there any question about whether or not the state would have the authority to require the private sector, some of these private facilities and hospitals, to participate for the benefit of the public in a public emergency?
6016	Leno	Mark	60	xL36G7ytN6U	1052	1091	Some charter schools have implemented discriminatory admission policies such as mandatory parental volunteer hours you may have read about those also requiring a certain level of English proficiency, as well as a certain grade point average. This bill will just make sure that all of our public schools charter and not, are playing by the same rules when it comes to admission policies and disciplinary policies. I ask for your aye vote.
6017	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	dGzAwlRr2xI	1340	1350	Disagreement. It's both administrative and the actual sick days, there was disagreement between the two houses and appropriations and the governor's office on what the actual cost would be.
6018	Weber	Shirley	44	Jy18DQ2_OCI	1546	1563	Yeah. It's not time to do it. So it's a question that we need some level of reform, but we can't make it this quickly and the committees have not adequately discussed it and it's not been a major item on our radar in the assembly to basically come to a conclusion that could be far reaching at this point.
6019	Bonilla	Susan	3	fjQhThyumBs	1300	1310	It's about how do we get there and making sure, again, that we're a part of that as elected representatives. I think that's very important. Thank you very much for your willingness to work together.
6020	Beall	Jim	92	rSN8XCdpbf8	147	161	The projects will be likely granted funding under this program, require a multi-year effort. And a level of financial certainty for the transit operators to plan. And that's why we're presenting this bill. As a Committee analysis states, this bill has a minor absorbable cost to implement.
6021	Gomez	Jimmy	80	4tou47dRNaA	264	284	allow them to become ADA compliant thereby wading off hopefully any predatory lawsuits in the future as well ad improving access to disabled Californians and disabled Americans. This is a program that small businesses need and I think that we can act today and I ask for your aye vote.
6022	Leno	Mark	60	H8Ib2A9DciA	444	470	We have drafted this bill to the limitations of government code section 19130 to respond to Governor Brown's veto, Senator Wieckowski's earlier efforts and the bill requires courts to show that they used due diligence in deciding to employ a private contractor to perform court services that are currently customarily been performed by trial court employees.
6023	Hertzberg	Robert	99	r2CpJ7yeI28	797	815	Can I just add one more part to that? Would you respond to this, because what happens is, you're right. Look everybody, belly aches and tells you the rotation of the Earth's going to stop and cost a ton of money, and the reality is, it happens. Remember this with Frans' low carbon fuel standard that we dealt with years ago. And you've got to kind of breakthrough from a public policy.
6024	Baker	Catharine	74	dic9GH4s49g	270	282	Let me say that again. An award-winning teacher, a teacher recognized by the community for being excellent for kids got a pink slip simply because she was more junior.
6025	Hertzberg	Robert	99	r2CpJ7yeI28	815	835	But, the flip side is also dangerous. PERPA, Jimmy Carter, 1979, qualified facilities. What we were spending for that stuff, they were just milking the system, right? You've got both sides of the trades. You've got one side where we need to move it; this is the delicacy of government. How it balances. On the other side, you've got the other cockroaches that are out there playing you.
6026	Bloom	Richard	2	GcYm7_0fTAo	342	379	Two, there must be documented proof that two or more significant planning or implementation actions related to the project occurred on or before December 31st, 2010. And lastly, there must also be documented proof that the bond issuance was being worked on prior to December 31, 2010. And based on these criteria, we think that only roughly 60% of the bond proceeds will actually be able to use. And the objective here is to eliminate those cities that rush to issue bonds in 2011, simply to lock up funds for future projects that didn't really exist.
6027	Dahle	Brian	47	GUxOzh3Wh0Q	1623	1633	So, if I may. Totally fine with that. And actually those are thoughtful amendments that you've brought forward and we're not afraid to talk about the reduction of greenhouse gases.
6028	Wilk	Scott	19	PZ5qNcZ4hzo	352	363	What I'm just interested why you want to include euthanasia in your bill? I don't see where we have jurisdiction over euthanasia, so he can respond in his close.
6029	Hill	Jerry	66	UpjsW9YiW28	492	506	But you don't know it's made in the USA, because it's being sold in California, so you're going to buy the $30 lamp, because it's cheaper, it looks the same. And everything else, but if it has a made in USA label it was made in California, you're gonna probably spend that extra few dollars to buy that because its made in the USA.
6030	Hall	Isadore	1	Gcdptg51L2I	359	380	CalPERS has identified real estate investments it has in the Trump organization in the State of New York valued in the millions. Additional private investments and licensing agreements with the trump organization can be found throughout the state from San Francisco to Los Angeles.
6031	Hill	Jerry	66	IyL6hnUxBjA	1227	1245	So thank you for that. It would not have developed at the 2015 safety action plan without your assistance. I think that's clearly your leadership and it's much appreciated by me and I believe all of us. And just to follow up a couple of questions from the chair on the ex parte issue I'm not going to ask.
6032	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	nJXs6pD2ors	348	363	With that I would ask. I have a witness, Kyle Jones with the Sierra Club to give us a little bit more on the cost of inaction and I thank you for your consideration and, at the appropriate time, I would respectfully ask for your aye vote.
6033	Beall	Jim	92	GcYm7_0fTAo	942	975	You're welcome, sir. Okay, let's, what I think the. Is the governor, how do we, it sounds like you're pretty close to the Governor, on coming up to- I don't know that I'd go that far Well tell me, because last year it was like, okay, so now we have this plus we have AB 113. Can you talk about how you feel we're gonna resolve this?
6034	Garcia	Eduardo	38	h4u4YccC9Z8	479	490	So it's a long answer to your question but I think I preface it with giving you a lay of the land in terms of where we stand in terms of time frames.
6035	McCarty	Kevin	22	ZHlQISHQoPg	1315	1343	And it's not just bad for everybody, it's bad for us because if people are paid poverty wages, that means we pay it on the back end, in social service costs, healthcare issues, food stamps, the works. Taxpayers subsidize this as well when people are paid sub-poverty wages, the notion of the carve out for entities I think is really dangerous.
6036	Wood	Jim	72	UUDrPWxX9_Y	417	468	The bill also requires all nine regional water quality control boards in the state to develop environmental protection guidelines to address waste water discharges from medical marijuana farms. However, we can not address the environmental concerns without looking at the source, which is cultivation. AB 243 establishes a regulatory system that puts some basic parameters around the cultivation of medical marijuana. Cultivation over sight is one of the ways to protect our water. The bill requires that a cultivator obtain a permit from a local jurisdiction first, and then a a state license from the Department of Food and Agriculture, before cultivation can begin. AB 243 creates a tag-permitted, medical pen structure for plants and actually on this particular plant there is a sample of a tag from the Mendocino County Sheriff's Department. You can't see it cuz it's down in the pot there. No pun intended.
6037	Gipson	Mike	28	dC2XrO3qZzY	1240	1272	Thank you very much Mr. Hoshino. I disagree with you on the fact that we don't have time to wait for 5 or 10 years for these things to be implemented. We have 4000 employees who have lost their jobs, we have 200 court rooms that stand vacant as a result of what has transpired, we have an audit report that stands before us that outlines significant deficiency within the structure of the organization.
6038	Grove	Shannon	77	JfU4ybXUoBc	76	88	And everybody's belief shall be considered. And you shouldn't deny one person's civil rights over another persons rights, or another organizations rights, just based on the fact of your personal opinion of an issue.
6039	Leno	Mark	60	mzRsScITOGM	313	338	So, just to review a current law, presently, authorizes, and that would be communications without all parties present, are prohibited in adjudication cases. They are permitted, with some disclosure, in rate setting cases. And are allowed without any limits, or disclosures in quasi legislative cases.
6040	Allen	Benjamin	70	bnZY7D5DzoY	803	816	Question, when you say that it's gonna lead to bifurcated rules, this has to do with the way that the roads are in Tehama County? That there's a certain area where there's major roads, and there's another area where there's not?
6041	Garcia	Cristina	112	vjC4sV_362o	1637	1652	Seria, Belisa, and Rihannan attend the LA County school for the arts. They are current Getlit players and they performed with the LA team at brave new voices 2014 where they earned 3rd in the world.
6042	Mitchell	Holly	64	F-LiWOGboCo	517	534	So clearly our voice has been heard. The LA report further cites that critical discussions of legislature must make this budget year to enable vital general fund investments this year and beyond. We cannot simply accept the current scenarios.
6043	Thurmond	Tony	4	9PxlbB74Usg	695	713	It had one of the highest rates of poverty and MediCal usage because we found, as Dr. Wood pointed out, that when children are in pain they cannot learn and so we know that the impacts are many; on health, on well-being, on education, and on many others, bottom line.
6044	Hueso	Ben	48	e0V9_HL0L10	230	275	And today we're also gonna hear from the Office of the Rate Payer Advocate who was created in 1984 for the purpose of trying to create this counter-balance to a situation in our state where we have created a sorts of monopoly in the delivery of certain services, like electrical services for example.  And that there was no counterbalance to the power of these organizations in the way we establish them. For the purpose of providing reasonable services to the community.
6045	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	mgO95LX_sqE	1119	1136	to include a vulnerability assessment, and climate adaptation strategies. Updates would be required the next time they update their local hazard mitigation plans, which are done every five years. Which many planned, many local governments have already done.
6046	Thurmond	Tony	4	EupEjx01Yv8	657	681	I was curious about your interaction that you described in your testimony, you mentioned that the friend who thought that unprotected sex was in fact protected sex and so in your interaction when you presented him with condoms was he convinced that that was the only way for him to be protected if he was going to be sexually active?
6047	Weber	Shirley	44	1dDkNt95rgU	1675	1690	I can remember, I was a faculty at San Diego State for 40 years, and during that time near the end there was an effort to increase student fees and every time it came up to talk about student success fees, the students said no, because they couldn't afford additional fees.
6048	Cooley	Ken	45	UvJ80C9MwvM	1885	1902	It sort of relates to this issue. John Kennedy used to say to govern is to choose. A great John Kennedy quote and the corollary is, you need to know the available choices. You need to know what your options are.
6049	Hall	Isadore	1	H5As3s88-Eg	109	124	Yeah, thank you. I want to thank Senator McGuire for bringing this forward. I think it's a good bill, and it's going to provide a lot of financial assistance for our veterans, and I want to thank the opponent for coming forward too and stating his opinion.
6050	Mitchell	Holly	64	V8GPRDBjfho	248	277	Again, the issues around language. The Department talked about the tools that are being used to collect data. I hope the threshold languages ultimately is the goal. Because if people don't, much like our challenge today with translation, if people who are the target and the beneficiary of the service can't access it by something as fundamental as language this will all be for naught.
6051	Thurmond	Tony	4	WBiuNzDlh60	268	285	kindergarten through third grade are not attending school. Now, it comes as no surprise, we've introduced the bill that will address truancy prevention for kids in grades kindergarten through third and we see this as a very important conversation. I wanna thank the author for bringing it forward and we look forward to working with you
6052	Mullin	Kevin	31	AAng3WP84Ks	1675	1694	Our motion shall be continued. Seeing and hearing no further business, I'm ready to entertain a motion to adjourn. Mr. Holden moves, Miss Olsen seconds that this house stands adjourned until Thursday, February nineteenth at nine AM. Quorum call is lifted.
6053	De Leon	Kevin	102	-v1uD0LX8sQ	1366	1382	No politician, Democrat or Republican, says "hey, I got an idea. It's big and it's bold. I'm going to move a piece of legislation that's going to raise gas prices and in fact is going to raise utility rates on everyone else" I think that's called political suicide.
6054	Stone	Jeff	26	XTEQkJHJtVg	170	186	Number one, how do we deal with the antiquated maps and making sure we have the appropriate information to make our decisions, and two, with regard to the exemptions and non exemptions, how are you defining what is economically treatable?
6055	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	4XOeWVTUKok	677	692	After spending decades in prison for crimes they didn't commit, wrongfully committed convicted persons are released back into the community without access to basic transitional services such as housing assistance, job training, or drug rehabilitation.
6056	Gomez	Jimmy	80	rOcxPrNyERc	392	406	The author has removed the provision that would change the employer size threshold significantly narrowing the scope of the bill. This bill will have absolutely no impact on businesses with 50 or fewer employees.
6057	Waldron	Marie	29	i1dEPEL80sQ	90	103	However there are similar processes involved and I know as a business owner over the course of 21-years we have had to change the way we did business because of the environmental waste and the regulations.
6058	Steinorth	Marc	35	xdTTK0YoutY	426	457	Thank you Mr. Speaker and members, I would like to ask the two classes, third-grade classes from Foothill Country Day if you would stand in the gallery. The parents and students from Claremont California have made their way all the way down here to learn about the State of California in our capital. I welcome you Foothill Country Day.
6059	Bonta	Rob	85	fRdlkKyIGD4	343	364	The board recommends rates to the legislature after a lengthy process that includes hearings and public input. In April 2015 the board recommended and unanimously approved a rate change of 3% each in 2016 and 2017 and 2% each in 2018 and 2019.
6060	Alejo	Luis	9	MlLd7E1te-c	123	132	you know, what you know, it's kind of upsetting to see that people have to go outside their home and have some emergency setup for them to do something that's so private to somebody,
6061	McGuire	Mike	93	GHyOxyKfubI	1973	1989	We are in active discussions with the authors of AB 266 and I do want to thank that entire team for the incredible discussions that we're having. We're trying to work through the policy differences between the two bills. And I also want to take a moment to thank Assemblyman Wood.
6062	Hernandez	Ed	103	BDjsPtF4Upk	365	379	And, the big difference is we are now mandating that patients purchase health insurance, and we have to make sure that they're protected from out-of-network billing. Members, I respectfully ask for an aye vote.
6063	Cannella	Anthony	61	hp2WTRF5hkg	42	63	We've required utility companies to, to do certain things. We have a very robust RPS program, so that costs money. And so if now folks are able to go out of that system and procure power at a, at a lesser rate, there still are those fixed charges that myself will have to cover and folks like me that don't have direct access. So, I'm concerned about that.
6064	Allen	Benjamin	70	ZMZhi0vPE74	1032	1049	So, but I am committed to, you know, continuing, whether it's me personally or my staff, I hope the folks understand that staff, I think everyone on the panel very much understands the staff are an integral part of the development of the bills.
6065	Low	Evan	11	JQ5xKCGxzzk	1292	1312	Sure, well the policy was first implemented in terms of the lifetime ban in 1983, so longer than, almost, I've been alive and when we talk about the, you know, 30 years is something to reevaluate and use science, a lot has progressed since then.
6066	Obernolte	Jay	86	xuTeMXcZRA0	31	49	Mr. Chair and members, I am here to present AB 271. This is a simple and common sense measure to permit shelter agencies that contract with the California Department of Education to keep their records electronically. Now, existing state laws already permits them to keep the records electronically if those records originate electronically.
6067	Pan	Richard	96	DJsU22tiuNg	1179	1201	And I think there's still quite a bit of work to do and I still see a lot of issues that I find problematic from even the patient, from the patient's prospective, even in terms of being sure that they get access, that they're able to get access to the services that they need, creating a situation where you're gonna discourage physicians from taking certain groups of patients.
6068	Beall	Jim	92	LNIc8kuNihE	31	59	So, this is a topic that has drawn attention, and we have some initiatives to specifically deal with this particular problem. I'll define the problem first. Nearly one in four children in foster care and 56% of children in group homes are receiving psychotropic drugs without adequate oversight.
6069	Alejo	Luis	9	eiRf682j8LU	630	645	And that includes the two largest districts in California. These districts pay close attention to the needs of the students. They recognize the diversity of their classrooms. And they have proven that it is feasible, that is is possible to make this a policy for our schools.
6070	Hill	Jerry	66	OcW4SGQXlmw	1186	1199	And one, do you feel that BreEZe is currently getting back to the BreEZe issue, providing the services and functionality that were guaranteed or were specified in phase one to those bureaus and boards?
6071	De Leon	Kevin	102	fdbxd6pnPrg	1731	1749	And the back and forth convinces me obviously that you're more than suited for this position with your temperment, with your outlook, with a sort of holistic outlook with regards to these young men who are obviously troubled for a whole variety of reasons.
6072	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	b7XHatlYhkw	410	430	Women had to fight for the vote, African Americans had to fight for the vote and here we are the practical application, should this pass, would be to deny far too many people the fundamental right of a Democratic society, and I would love to hear what the argument is to go back
6073	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	0LdXFnPqPCk	258	273	Selma was many miles down a very long highway stretch. There's a federal park along that road that commemorates the respite tent city that marchers made on the journey for freedom and access to the ballot box.
6074	De Leon	Kevin	102	SNbIvbnUyMw	149	165	So the allegations of the accusations of ad hoc application with regards to the permitting process is no longer now with the Lean Six Sigma system that you have.
6075	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	V40hlwpKzww	1022	1039	Yes, If I may before you leave, because there's a long line of folks who would like to say a few words, I'm sure. You talk about the bureaucratic, how cumbersome it is now, the bureaucracy. What is it that's required and why is it cumbersome?
6076	Pan	Richard	96	07ilphfHuEw	1204	1222	All right so that if you vote no, I think you're sending the wrong message there. Finally, I also just want to say that we've been working also very hard with mainly the state workers in terms of, we talk about retiree health and one of the things I've been working with them is how do we actually produce healthier work environments
6077	Allen	Benjamin	70	KfUw5Z9TrzY	854	864	So I just want to take a moment to say how much I appreciate this 1% to vote on these types of things, you are working with the opposition on this.
6078	Hancock	Loni	98	iOsHLGCzh8U	1018	1028	I'm sorry I missed the testimony of the two Chiefs from my district, but I can catch up with you. I know where to find you and vice versa.
6079	Stone	Jeff	26	DwrMQLfFxcs	976	998	Thank you, Madam Chair. Could you describe the process by which the SCDD grants are awarded and monitored? And how the outcomes of these grant funded activities are used to inform system change? And probably more importantly, why was the amount allocated for community-development decreased by 34% this year?
6080	Nguyen	Janet	65	VHKwUGu3F0g	1664	1692	Or in Orange County its only 620,000. We as senators represent a million should we then split the senators and add 40 more senators? To me, I get the LA County part. But putting San Bernardino, Orange County, Riverside County on the same boat, that we only represent half a million people is, to me it is so unnecessary.
6081	McGuire	Mike	93	fkvme1Ux-zg	1022	1038	finished college and became a teacher, eventually landing at the Santa Rosa Junior College, teaching women's history. In 1978, she convinced the school administration to proclaim the week of March 8th Women's History Week and she would joke with friends first
6082	Gatto	Mike	46	xhI7BgS1JK0	956	969	And I could see that being relevant when you're trying to underwrite insurance. I mean, you know, of course it's relevant what the level of income is if if you've got somebody who is way in over their head, and they're going to lose the house in three or four months, you know, they're not going to take care of it.
6083	Nazarian	Adrin	36	wK5CwGDTeOM	1141	1164	This percentage rises to 58% for individuals under the age of 24. 20,000 California's who do not know they are HIV Positive are causing 70% of the new infections. In an attempt to identify these individuals, AB 521 requires an HIV test to be offered to a patient upon admission to the hospital from the emergency department.
6084	Williams	Das	12	2b3SgDbb8jI	1107	1137	And because five members directly elected, when many of the community members only live in that community for four to five years, means a large turnover. And so, the flexibility of having an appointed official from the county and an appointment from the University, will be able to round out the board and provide a greater longevity of board members.
6085	Anderson	Joel	57	-v1uD0LX8sQ	818	836	I think they think about, "you know, I want to put bread on the table.  I want my kids to go to a safe school, get a better education than I received and improve their station in life. I want the glass ceiling removed from me. I don't want to be a slave to energy."
6086	Gallagher	James	108	6qpSAuN2om0	917	926	I'm going to go aye on this, and I don't think that was in that earlier, but it's important especially in child custody cases the parents have the opportunity.
6087	Levine	Marc	8	gP-mCxG_DCU	1716	1732	AB 900 will remove an unintended road block for undocumented youth to remain in this country legally, and also provide stability in their lives through the support of the state court and their legal guardian. Here to speak in support of the bill is Rachel Prandini with the Immigrant Legal Resource Center.
6088	Hueso	Ben	48	2afEpcU9CME	1447	1479	Junipero Sarah has been representing the state since the beginning of the program in 1934. And, he was an amazing man who pretty much laid the foundation for the establishment of the state through the mission system. California is the only state in America that has a mission trail and it is the only state that was seen of strategic importance in the colonization of the new world.
6089	Stone	Jeff	26	I00r4tID8_Y	845	858	I haven't seen or heard of one example where the steam fracturing or the drilling has caused the compromise of any potable water supplies in the state of California.
6090	McGuire	Mike	93	e-eay8FdlZA	1668	1686	Okay. So just, well I'd like to follow up on the EQRO, and I appreciate that, thank you. So I want to get back to the issue of wait times. Again, this is the issue that we continue to hear, and I know it is more on the mental health side.
6091	Medina	Jose	81	iylj0sWv7JI	1120	1134	I want to thank CSU for working with the legislature and working out policy and I want to thank Miss Weber for taking the amendments as outlined in the analysis. Miss Weber if you'd like to close?
6092	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	HJEL7SBoV-4	1405	1415	And clearly, if the federal government would act, a lot of what we have to do here, you know, sort of the Yin and the Yang would be resolved and we wouldn't have to be doing so much of this.
6093	Hadley	David	40	csda2pMKJRU	1106	1135	Mr. Chair, members, good morning. So I'm pleased this morning to present AB 1408. The current maximum fee of $10 per signature for most notarizations was set in 1993, 22 years ago, and has not been increased since. Notaries perform simple yet essential functions for our society.
6094	Thurmond	Tony	4	OHndMPLrpTA	1270	1287	But I wanna be on record in making an observation, in making a clarification. One, I think a point was very well made by the representative from the manufacturer's group. As well as some of the members of this committee that they felt that a particular entity was being singled out.
6095	Achadjian	K.H. "Katcho"	5	q3bnYP-Cdo8	282	304	Thank you Mr. Chair it is quite an honor for me to be your Vice Chair, I look forward to your leadership and as you said it I also want to welcome all-new members and returning members look forward to working with any and all of you at any given time, please don't hesitate to any questions prior to the meeting if you would like to visit office please do so looking forward to great year ahead of us thank you Mr. Chair.
6096	De Leon	Kevin	102	m4t87KOfLMk	1217	1240	And these are issues that I believe that CARB members will tackle as they move forward with their charge, but this is a major paradigm shift, and it's a good one. It's a good one in terms of inclusivity, in terms of diversity. Obviously we have gone a long way with the CalEnviro screen.
6097	Pavley	Fran	104	4HKs3ChJG74	1072	1086	What happens after you're out of school and there's no places in these supported work programs or supported housing? So I think it's a collective responsibility to deal with this.
6098	Gomez	Jimmy	80	QXW5aikdMmE	1541	1570	AB 1218, Weber, disabled veterans business enterprise, program procurement goals, due pass. A role call. AB 1293, Holden, state civil service employees rights, due pass. B role call. AB 1354, Dodd, income inequality programs, state contracting, due pass with amendments to delete the requirement for the Department of Fair Employment and Housing to approve and certify programs and instead authorize the department to audit programs for compliance. B roll call.
6099	De Leon	Kevin	102	fspIOvsCcqM	1177	1194	Your experience is rich, it's unquestioned. I think you know what the charge, the mandate is at least from this committee is for bold, new leadership. Obviously the accountability factor in this case is sub three in the Budget Committee as we move forward.
6100	Leno	Mark	60	J0kwSkFFMEE	1233	1244	No need to apologize, Senator. Thank you, your concerns are all evidence-based and we're trying to get the most for our dollar spent, so your points are well-taken. Senator Hancock.
6101	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	y23O4kWOpz4	327	337	To just sort of slough it off, I think it's just ill-conceived and I think it denies the reality that we need to address regardless of what side of the aisle we're on.
6102	Hill	Jerry	66	4Ls4aOm_vdA	958	974	Ratepayers will pay as much in this one contract as they paid for five years of pipeline safety regulation. The PUC is undermining its ability to fulfill its statutory and constitutional responsibilities by hiring a criminal attorney.
6103	Weber	Shirley	44	bencsnxh2-c	652	663	I don't know, I've thought about it and I've thought about it. I don't have a solution to it other than I know that there are a lot of folks who are caught in the middle. I think as a, as a, as a higher ed committee, we have to begin to look at this and we've looked at it over the last couple of years.
6104	Mullin	Kevin	31	KEeiqVKf9vU	946	964	Ms. Grove that is at the discretion of the speaker. We have a few more procedural items. I'd ask that you talk with Madam Speaker on speaking on condition of the file. In the meantime Mr. Holden you are recognized for your motion.
6105	Pavley	Fran	104	aMmnutMx8lk	909	922	Assembly member Bigelow just presented file item two, there was no opposition to the bill. It's been moved by Senator Vidak. Call the role. It's due to pass with the amendments to the committee on appropriations.
6106	Hernandez	Ed	103	iDZCoA28Gzg	1143	1216	Thank you. We're at one more item left, item number 12. Sergeants, can we call the assembly member? Okay, we're at item number 12, AB 1278, Assemblymember Gray, cigarettes and tobacco products identification requirements. Welcome.  Good afternoon.
6107	Hertzberg	Robert	99	qrLFVDrXadw	603	620	Opposition? Anybody here on opposition to the measure? Any further questions to the members? We had a motion I believe by Senator Pabley. And that motion is, would be do pass to appropriations. Anything further, Mr. Chairman?
6108	Hancock	Loni	98	PEX_sZig7aU	1503	1583	Yes, thank you Mr. Chairman those are very interesting comments because maybe one of the things we should have in the application is how the local community intends to sustain whatever facility is built because that would encourage the long-term thinking from the locals but I was also intrigued. You were sort of alluding to, I think, what we have for many utilities which is the basic users fee within increased rates after that because I represent two very low-income communities in california as well but our water agency has put an incredible incentive to conservation and I think that would be a very important thing for both urban low-income communities but for anything that we do in the future because. Obviously the water is so scarce in some of the places for these disadvantaged communities are in the central valley but I was wondering how you're anticipating the local, the low-income and disadvantaged communities to reacting to consolidation with other water agencies?
6109	Mitchell	Holly	64	11yyICoQ5m8	2016	2029	But again, I guess my comment is broader about why it's so important that all positions on a bill are reflected in the analysis. Because it becomes a part of what is often too many times oral history in this building.
6110	Gaines	Ted	24	YaizxSy4_NU	711	735	Thank you madame President. I bring to you the South Lake Tahoe community college reciprocal agreement. That must reach agreement on both the state of Nevada and the State of California. We're working on the California side. That's the first step and we have Assembly members that are technical in nature and I urge your aye vote.
6111	Hernandez	Ed	103	9Ksuo-8qRMo	133	153	We are now at item number nine, SB 361, Hill, scaled nursing facilities, antimicrobial stewardship guidelines.  It's my understanding that there is no opposition, support on both sides, I'd appreciate if we can make it brief, and if you have individuals that'd like to speak in support, that they do the same as well.
6112	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	YGvsvPIzjxQ	1918	1938	Thank you, thank you, we'll bring it back to the committee. I have a few comments and maybe a question for Mr. Ashley, in fact. And I think it's kind of been hinted here, is where does this test go next? I think it should comport with Common Core. I kind of differ with our last witness there, that maybe it doesn't have to, I think it should.
6113	Gomez	Jimmy	80	JgpqDSrKaXw	1647	1666	B roll call. AB 667, Wagner, security finders, do pass. A roll call. AB 670, Irwin, Security Assessments for State Agencies, do pass. A roll call. AB 706, Bonilla, California AmeriCorps-STEM, do pass. A roll call. AB 708, Jones-Sawyer, cleaning product and green disclosure, do pass. B roll call.
6114	Wieckowski	Bob	55	zqM_Vy0kspE	737	758	They may, people that change their oil every 3,000 miles, whether they get that crappy stuff or this 15,000 or 100,000, they're just going to do it because that's the way grandpa raised them to do it. That's the...and they're still not going to recycle it, they're still going to do whatever the 41% does.
6115	Wieckowski	Bob	55	zqM_Vy0kspE	723	737	No, no, but that's one of the criticisms that was raised in the committee report is that consumers, I mean we're changing the message here is, we're saying if we are not going to change consumer practices even though they could.
6116	Mendoza	Tony	52	UpKpxYjD9F8	2431	2446	I want to make sure that the school district that authorize it has the capacity to oversee this charter that they're creating and I want to also make sure that there is an assessment of anticipated financial and educational impacts to nearby schools when they are created.
6117	Cooper	Jim	21	221fDwPaPVs	1308	1317	I was just trying to figure out what percentage of state employees they cover. Is it 30 or 40%? Is it a large number or not really a significant number?
6118	De Leon	Kevin	102	smXlkYaEapc	544	566	And that's why you have a major task in front of you. I do believe after today's hearing, that you have the right stuff to make this happen. I can't emphasize and underscore enough, that it's absolutely critical that you engage with Senators Hill, Hueso, and Leno,
6119	McCarty	Kevin	22	ZcJSZ4qEe4Y	77	89	However, even with this great action last year, it's estimated that over 30,000 low-income families in California are without access to either state preschool, Head Start, or the transitional kindergarten program in the K-12 school system.
6120	Allen	Benjamin	70	5faCP0gCJNs	110	126	So in April I went to Colorado for meetings with some of their state and local election officials. I was thoroughly impressed with their system, which not only saves money but increases turn out by making voting very convenient and lots of different ways of getting to vote.
6121	Moorlach	John	4657	8epuGfrU4TQ	804	821	I'm making that assumption. But I'm just curious Mr. Chair you make one point and that is it will probably cost someone a little bit of money, if they're having someone prepare their returns, so that'll take part of the credit.
6122	Bates	Pat	58	_Bb4hK8XVqo	732	752	You have local opposition. How do you get through all of that and not let a local government, which has happened before, not use the money? At the Transportation Authority we have to, if a local government that has a project with our county and it's not moving forward, they can request an extension.
6123	Thurmond	Tony	4	DunUs63qSXI	849	866	Mr. Chiu, we're not going to. We don't have purview of that, but we will reach out to the Judicial Council staff of this committee will provide a little bit more information when we have our hearings on foster youth so that we could at least take at least a superficial view of that so that we can address your concern. Would that be satisfactory?
6124	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	qjDm_sZ-lfo	625	643	The post conviction relief is a separate value. And so, it states in the bill, anything that has an independent value, like in the specifically post conviction relief, stopping deportation, those can move forward. But, you know, we have a number of organizations including, Congressman Gutierrez who has put out on his website
6125	Thurmond	Tony	4	LiSz4J23j1Q	893	922	I wanna give you the courtesy as a member. My gut is fearful. And I've always had one mantra and I'm gonna stick to it today. And that's if it wouldn't make my kids proud, I can't do it. And I wanna give you the courtesy, as was stated by my colleague to extend the discussion but my heart tells me, be fearful and be cautious.
6126	Hill	Jerry	66	XrOqCob7jCo	1023	1041	Yeah and just to respond to Mr. Jensen's concerns and it is an issue because we're going into kind of unchartered territory in California by requiring a mental health evaluation before you issue that permit to carry the weapon and especially with the 40,000 that currently have licenses, how you handle the renewals.
6127	Stone	Mark	20	Lvmuh7dHiTc	51	67	And I introduced Assemblymember Chu's staff, and we'll start public comment with Susan Kennedy from Assemblymember Kevin Mullin's office, who wanted to make a statement. Mr. Mullin represents the district just to the south of here.
6128	Quirk	Bill	23	843OfhKnV14	772	795	And I seen this in city councils, school boards, board of supervisors where the people are full time. And there's sort of two things that can go wrong. One is that the executive director, be it the superintendent or the county manager, start setting policy as opposed to executing it.
6129	Nielsen	Jim	68	0J9n2c3eCds	1817	1842	of produce for marketing, direct marketing. But I don't think you'd consider very many of these a commercial farming enterprise. It's just someone who chooses to live out in the rural areas and they enjoy that environment and in order to have water they have to have a domestic well. But I have not seen very many that were
6130	Dababneh	Matthew	50	22ufHgqGK-A	806	823	Kind of survey so if you could provide some kind of clarification in terms of actual documentation of the claims you made in the numbers.  That would be very helpful.  Also I would remind you that the State of California is much bigger than San Francisco.  In San Francisco you always have much more public transportation options,
6131	Bloom	Richard	2	w6A3dw8D_mc	1164	1182	Not sure that that's responsive to my question which is, how does the administration propose to incorporate the kind of stakeholder and expert to input that currently is part of the process?
6132	Pavley	Fran	104	3CsrxcXxpcI	581	603	You have five votes. That's enough to pass out of this committee. We'll keep it open for add ons. Thank you Senator de Leon. So, where are we now? What happened to Senator Cathleen Galgiani? So, we're going to go Senator Berryhill? Senator Berryhill? You've just been made a joint author on the park bill. No. [laughter]
6133	Leno	Mark	60	gWhhKfvsU08	277	304	And when we talk about the well-being of the child and specifically, success in the classroom, all of the research and every report, I think any of us have ever seen would document that those children that have benefit of early care and education are going to do much better once they get to kindergarten, first grade and beyond.
6134	Hernandez	Roger	37	1E-hERPJ9VM	59	75	The information from the California Reducing Disparities project indicates communities are not receiving culturally appropriate services. In fact, in some instances they are not being reached at all because they might require different approaches to bring them into the system.
6135	Allen	Benjamin	70	akOKQetVqu4	1639	1661	I put same day registration on the table and-- oh sorry, automatic registration on the table in part because I wondered if it might help address some of that sort of boom and bust that would be happening. And also address some of these other things that we've been talking about, the concerns about how registration is slipping relative to other states and how, you know, and turnout generally is a problem.
6136	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	Q1ptrvjk-As	46	71	First let me start by accepting the committee amendments that are in the analysis, I appreciate the time and effort that was taken to help improve on this effort. This bill would require the Department, the California Department of Education, to develop a Title IX instructional video to help school districts better understand and become compliant with the terms of Title IX, passed over 40 years ago.
6137	Leno	Mark	60	tKvbsbeieQ4	37	62	Thank you Senator Allen. I think one less question for you all and then we'll move on to the third panel. This would be for Ms. Gollons or Ms. Simon. Have you all assessed the career pathways trust and career technical education pathways initiatives success and, given that they're both about the sunset?
6138	Levine	Marc	8	ZmQN_cLb26Y	756	769	However, recent court decisions raised the question of whether the law fully protects workers from retaliation when a worker requests these accommodations? As a result, workers now too often keep quiet and are afraid to make such requests.
6139	Pavley	Fran	104	M0MScnK_2Tc	845	876	Discovery in expert witnesses, the people that testified at the hearing last fall, suggested that it would make a lot of sense that we just follow the federal procedures which require disclosure of specific items without waiting a discovery request and also follow federal procedures which require an expert witness to provide a written report on opinions the witness will express and the basis and reasons for them, so you're prepared and able to expedite the proceedings.
6140	Wood	Jim	72	KcpO7Oo2ci0	1086	1110	And that is inherently how the ACA isn't really working well for small businesses. And I will cite an example of someone else in my district, further north, in Crescent City who is an employer who had 30 employees, family owned business, second generation owner. When he went to file for his renewal last year, he got within two days and
6141	Baker	Catharine	74	dic9GH4s49g	1565	1574	I think the one that is the most arbitrary is one that doesn't consider any particular features of the teacher but simply arbitrarily considers their seniority, which is what we are dealing with today.
6142	Gray	Adam	27	NB_4qAwCIAU	192	211	that does not mean that we should still not demand excellence and accountability. California's gaming sector will only continue to prosper and grow through vigilant and unyielding oversight that is focused squarely on maintaining integrity. However, no regulatory system, whether state or federal can assure integrity or

6144	Bloom	Richard	2	_ES7C4KFvkc	1081	1100	Perhaps LAO can help me understand why, what seems to me to be a fairly narrow focus on test taking when technology, connectivity, has so much broader implications for student success today.
6145	Frazier	Jim	114	uolbChB4jBI	651	667	Thank you Mr Patterson. Any members of the public that would like to testify and support this bill? Please state your name and who you represent and support or oppose please.
6146	Lara	Ricardo	107	tHDAU5JmwzE	555	568	Next measure is SB 11. Police officer training mental health. Do pass as amended for the author to make technical changes. Substitute the roll from SB 254. That bill is approved on a unanimous vote of seven to zero.
6147	Calderon	Ian Charles	115	llrxaJMn6L0	1336	1353	The real intent of this bill is you know, I came about this legislation not because somebody brought it to me but because I knew right to die was going to be coming to the state legislature. And so I started researching it and happened upon right to try.
6148	Pan	Richard	96	t4_AyYAahhk	750	770	They're dedicated, but they don't have the time and you don't have the environment in the school that provides that ability for interaction, because the education that happens at any college, at any level of higher education, whether it's community college, CSU or UC, isn't just what happens in the classroom.
6149	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	G-cKeAHj51U	2515	2541	And you know that I went to Selma this year. It was a part of the 50th anniversary celebration and the concurrent elected officials and the, it's another organization, for some reason it alludes me that were partners with ours in screening the movie Selma.
6150	Roth	Richard	106	SvIBnS8_PpY	2027	2040	Whether it's a building construction fund, whether it's a self insurance reserve, whether it's a reserve to pay retiree benefits of one sort or another. More importantly whether it's a litigation reserve.
6151	Chiu	David	7	0LdXFnPqPCk	1459	1488	Thank you, Mr. Jones-Sawyer. Would you like the first roll to be open for co-authors? Okay. The clerk will open the roll. Members, this is for co-authors. This is for co-authors. The clerk will close the roll. 75 co-authors are added. We can take a voice vote on this item. All those in favor say aye, all those opposed say nay. The aye's have it. The resolution is adopted.
6152	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	0LdXFnPqPCk	1426	1439	So I think today we are rejuvenated by everyone that has spoken in this chamber today that we have to be reinvigorated in the fight that those people laid there lives down for 50 years ago.
6153	McGuire	Mike	93	zEbSrzyLdms	1443	1453	The reason I ask is because the task force, and I know we have two that are tracking, but isn't that one of the goals is to be able to look how those dollars are being spent at the regional center level, correct?
6154	Mitchell	Holly	64	tCaUe0Vt8NQ	1377	1402	I wonder if, if there is an opportunity for the legislature to communicate your stated desire to Congress and, and if it's a kind of an across the board desire For them to reevaluate federal poverty level, because so many of these programs have a cliff effect, where you literally get a raise, or you, or, or you have more hours one week and you fall off the cliff.
6155	Beall	Jim	92	aa-UBR8QVvE	318	360	There's a Committee that I happen to be a member of and their reporter deadline is June 30 of 2018 to report to the Legislature about a proposal for replacing the fuel tax with some kind of vehicle mileage based kind thing, but htey left it pretty open so there's a lot of complicated issues privacy is one of you know-how you do what kind of IT thing you're going to do with the  et cetera, et cetera so more to be discovered.
6156	Cooley	Ken	45	mNyHP9HDpqk	59	70	And this raises the issue of then how do those loved ones, those family members understand what that directive was, and how they, how this kin wish to be handled.
6157	Allen	Benjamin	70	QF0xTMWqn0g	1076	1099	Yeah. So, I guess until we have determined that we're still somehow allowing this activity that non-exempt aquifers, that have not received exemption. So, I guess I'm just having trouble with what I'm perceiving is a violation of the law.
6158	Mullin	Kevin	31	hb1VvxrKGQE	1174	1195	With me today is Rebecca Long, with the Metropolitan Transportation Commission to answer technical questions. As well as Denis Mulligan with the Golden Gate Bridge highway and transportation district in support. And just wanted to mention there are many public safety benefits to this measure as well which I could discuss in detail if you wish. And with that, would like to turn it over to my witnesses.
6159	Hancock	Loni	98	VyoFcVtTJtQ	349	364	Yeah, thank you very much. I am going to be supporting this bill today. And there are number of reasons for that. One is I do think rodeo qualifies as physical activity.
6160	Dababneh	Matthew	50	1fxZCVj9XoA	1083	1098	This is a very straightforward bill that will stop counterfeiters from profiting from their crimes, hold them financially liable, and capture the tax revenues loss as a direct result of their criminal activities. I respectfully ask your aye vote today.
6161	Gipson	Mike	28	ehjG4WNbq0w	1729	1741	Thank you very much. Do you have comments you'd like to make? No comments. Members, anyone have any comments regarding this item before us? Hearing and seeing none, is there anyone in the audience?
6162	Pan	Richard	96	89bDX7qtwgo	334	353	But then, we were later told by the department, no, it's a take it or leave it. And so what I want to know is can the department, when we identify specific cases of access problems and if rates turn out to be one of the problems, make a adjustment to the rate.
6163	Bigelow	Frank	91	HBHfaes5iio	136	148	No file. Any questions from members? Mr. Alejo, I have a question for you. Recognizing that of the four high schools, two of those high schools happen to be in my particular district that I represent.
6164	Bonilla	Susan	3	1AD-QUnKZQc	1160	1180	AB 1197 provides a simple and modest solution to a potential issues with ongoing contracts. I have with me today Toni Pulone, legislative chair of the Deposition Reporters Association and is that Ed Howard leaving? Yes it is. He was here, but he represents the DRA.
6165	Hernandez	Roger	37	nJsCwYpjBcE	1172	1189	It's innate in them to serve and to protect, to be caretakers. This is an issue now that is broadening because of this, at least for me personally, in my office many have asked how we can broaden the discourse here and maybe revisit. The opposition has pointed out concerns.
6166	Maienschein	Brian	84	KpERIVYvrj0	1596	1608	Members, this concludes our business for the day. Without objection, we'll leave the roll open for ten minutes for add-ons after which time this meeting will stand adjourned. If you have missed a vote, just stay seated and the secretary will call the roll.
6167	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	L_nqL1xdfS8	65	95	committee, you're free to go because those matters have all been taken up and addressed. And other than that, we will now turn to our agenda, and again start off as the sub-committee. File item seven is Senator Hernandez, SB 672. And if you would like to step forward, Senator. We'd like to welcome you and the method that we use here is we'll have,
6168	Gatto	Mike	46	kAZMIWno7zI	138	158	which is verbally by the members of this committee so you'll  need to keep watching this feed to watch your question being answered by the panel. And again you can submit your questions at tinyurl.com/privacy224, that's tinyurl.com/privacy224
6169	Holden	Chris	78	EQZBghQKoaM	1008	1035	Assembly Bill 525 enables franchisees to sell their business to a qualified new owner so long as the franchisor approves. Renewal. Lastly, AB-525 provides certainty to small business franchisees that they will be able to renew their franchise agreement and continue operating their business so long as they abide by the contract terms.
6170	Chiu	David	7	g1KhSxf2FKA	1402	1425	$200 million in the form of a 4% federal tax credit. Another $400 million in the form of the Federal Tax Exempt Bond Authority. So that's close to $1 billion, and the fact if Senator Beall's SB-377 bill passes, which this committee passed and your body passed around fixing the tax implications of our tax credit, that would mean another $100 million on top of what we're talking about.
6171	Bonta	Rob	85	h3qpDny4S5o	1430	1446	Ms. Cantwell good to see you. I've seen you a number of times in different Committees and look forward to more in the future. And you know, my position on increasing Medi-Cal provider rates and I'm going to continue to push that. And ask for your collaboration and work together on it.
6172	Gatto	Mike	46	UdyJhNk-vh8	719	737	Yeah, and that's the point that a lot of the thinkers with minds far greater than mine have pointed out is that the difference between a drone of course and private aircraft is that an aircraft is subject to requiring a human pilot and landing and refueling and, a lot of things, and also making quite a bit of noise.
6173	Hadley	David	40	MXopMyL2hsg	793	814	Thank you. Any witnesses in opposition to the ACR? Are there any other witnesses who want to speak neither for nor against? That's often a possibility. I will-- I'll bring it back to the committee then, my colleagues.
6174	Quirk	Bill	23	qW3ZYP7zbss	1121	1138	And also, in terms of you mentioned, recovery of assets for the people who've been trafficked. I think these are all critical, and then we've mentioned others in particular, the importance of the wrap around social services.
6175	Frazier	Jim	114	7UjH6y-2-HM	282	304	The guidelines also identify which symptoms, such as letter reversals, are a normal part of growth and development. Require that the guidance regarded instruction focus on an instructional approach, which is evidence-based, multi-sensory, direct, explicit, structured, and sequential.
6176	Wolk	Lois	94	WQvzzUrj4uM	4	31	Thank you, Mitchell. I want to thank my colleagues and I want to thank my other colleagues for this robust discussion, heart-felt, and meaningful. I want to only focus on one allegation because the person's name was mentioned as an example of how the Oregon law has not been honored. It's failed. It's inappropriate.
6177	De Leon	Kevin	102	rD0VjcELenc	669	688	These appointees were heard in Rules Committee on March 4 and approved on a bipartisan vote, 5-0. There was no opposition. Frank Bass is reappointment. He has served on the board since 2001. He is an attorney with over 25 years of experience, specifically practicing workers' compensation law.
6178	Stone	Jeff	26	XCFU_0j8dAo	39	58	And, provide a financial benefit to local, municipal government for the sale of the electricity generated. As proposed, this project will be the first of its kind in the state, and represents a new potential mechanism to improve our state, create jobs, and save our local government's money.
6179	Wolk	Lois	94	WQvzzUrj4uM	31	60	The allegation had to do with Kate Cheney, who was 85 years-old, with inoperable stomach cancer. The allegation the opponents claim, that her physician and two mental health professionals, felt she was not competent to make decisions, was being pressured by her daughter. The medical Director of the HMO this is the allegation. Ignore the opinions and wrote a prescription for her.
6180	Liu	Carol	63	J856PLRqmtw	125	142	And it my hope that today's hearing will provide members with information about the new LCFF funding formula its current status, the challenges thus far, and the opportunities and options that lie ahead for both locals and state policy-makers.
6181	Weber	Shirley	44	sxH5Xtvq9A4	1266	1281	And they all got stopped only to discover that one of them was a judge and all of them carried bar cards. But they were all African-American. So the issue of racial profiling is a thing that we live with everyday and fortunately today we have the opportunity to begin to address it.
6182	Cannella	Anthony	61	MJ3yc4dhcxc	2009	2023	Okay. You're very crafty in your answers. You're not necessarily answering me directly. So before this fee was in place, it's now $25, $4 the DMV, what did consumers pay to have this service done? Was it more than what we're paying now?
6183	Lara	Ricardo	107	-Ah0Dbgfor4	2044	2061	SB 229 Courts Judgeships. Do pass as amended to appropriate 10 million from general fund, to fund six judges consistent with the budget action. Substitute the roll call from SB 254. That bill is approved, an unanimous vote of seven to zero.
6184	Mendoza	Tony	52	5EeaivfMcyY	66	91	For unlicensed entities, however, the CRB has had challenges when attempting to impose fines for ethical or legal violations. These violations range from gift-giving to a practice known as penny invoicing. In which a shorthand, reporting firm will charge a penny per invoice to assist a law firm with it's litigation costs while charging full price to that law firm's opposition.
6185	Garcia	Eduardo	38	RxWs3TzpYXg	1400	1411	And we ask, respectfully ask, for your vote. With me are a couple members of the blind society and fire experts to testify or answer any technical questions, on behalf of the bill.
6186	Gomez	Jimmy	80	Rbv3X8-oLv8	381	393	So, I'm committed to making sure that we tackle this problem and that we put up a package as soon as possible on the floor of the Assembly for a vote.
6187	Weber	Shirley	44	_ES7C4KFvkc	660	668	So that in itself is somewhat problematic as we kind of look at this program and we move forward as to how we're going to fall for all of us to think about.
6188	Monning	Bill	25	2ACgjV10AcU	1637	1661	And then it seems the amendments that are suggested about one of the goals, and I'll direct this question to the author, is to try to eliminate the covert collection of information. The person with the camera hiding in the bushes or- Would that include a telephoto lens from a great distance away?
6189	Thurmond	Tony	4	goLRzsDXvfE	403	414	AB 1014 would give school districts the resources they need help kids get back in school and to generate needed ADA revenue for their schools and I urge your yes vote for AB 1014.
6190	Salas	Rudy	34	fmIaR7hDQ6w	2148	2170	And Mr. Mathis and all the committee members here wanna be helpful. Sometimes we don't know how to be helpful. So, The guidance you can provide since you are there, or having us ask the right questions. I am pleased to hear that everyone locally is working well with Cal OES and that we are kind of plugging along.
6191	Bloom	Richard	2	IBKt_ere1yc	83	101	So, these things are in conflict with one another and the challenges in the fiscal operation trade-offs have been studied for several years now and after many months of negotiations with local governments, the transit industry has now put forward this measure to put into place a long term solution.
6192	Hertzberg	Robert	99	X78wW8GGX60	0	16	Just want to disclose publicly that my political campaign was a client of Mr. Mitchell. Just to make sure we all know. I see my Chief of Staff in the audience and I know that he keeps me in compliance. But no, this is a great panel. Excellent suggestions.
6193	Mitchell	Holly	64	Ni0SUtR1cC4	1561	1578	Because under Healthy Families here, a parent, whatever their situation they could pay for coverage for their child under Healthy Family so I see. So that could be significant. Okay. Thank you. Any questions? Members? Finance has nothing? Okay, thank you. Public comment.
6194	Mitchell	Holly	64	MTWW-DN4Tdo	1530	1618	Moving on to, again, the Department of Social Services, Child Welfare Services, item one, the continuum of Care Reform Program. The recommendation is to adopt as proposed and to adopt placeholder trailer bill language that will include additional detail and specifications for how the $3.8 million for foster parent outreach, recruitment, and support will be used. That's out with a 3 to 0 vote.
6195	Nielsen	Jim	68	J0kwSkFFMEE	387	410	And I don't know how many years it's been since we had a bond, a facilities bond. There's a $9 billion one blooming out of here as a proposal, but facilities are important to do any of this. Have you considered the facility needs for this organization, reorganization, and the change?
6196	Allen	Benjamin	70	QUWe44dQD4o	840	869	Just to follow up on this, there was another recommendation in here that talked about how operators ought to offer adequate assurances that fracking operations will not extend into protected aquifers. And so given the vagueness of our understanding of the water quality issues and perhaps of the permeability, what does that look like to you from a policy recommendation perspective?
6197	Dodd	Bill	71	KzIfF7fCyGE	1213	1234	Yes, I'm an iPhone carrying Uber client I guess. And I just wanted to make sure because we've discussed this, Mr. Nazarian, that what I've heard is that across the board, these are uniform standards that were requiring of taxicab drivers
6198	Salas	Rudy	34	fmIaR7hDQ6w	1709	1734	From your guy's perspective, is there anything, it sounded like to me everyone's working really well with Cal OES, on the ground level, we're looking at short term, I think somebody described it as interim, goals and seeing how they fit in with the long term goals. I just heard several but
6199	Nazarian	Adrin	36	gmyBR_4Q_cg	1438	1462	In numbers from, in numbers, from what I understand, there are potentially between 3 to 5% of individuals, who come to an emergency room, that could be found, and if I'm wrong, please correct me, that could be found from their blood drawn that they might be HIV infected.
6200	Hernandez	Ed	103	JtKXoGz7JFs	505	518	Please join us, along with hospitals, clinics, health plans, physician groups, large and small businesses, labor, consumers, academic groups, large and small business, and seniors, and an array of health care providers, in support of this measure.
6201	Chau	Ed	116	0lsNxjB7bP8	257	277	Limiting the data collected by ride sharing mobile applications does not reduce the functionality to consumers who use and love them. On the contrary, this legislation not, is not about limiting the consumer, it is about getting the consumer ownership of their privacy right, which can be the subject of abuse under certain, circumstances.
6202	Beall	Jim	92	iJc5cTYtc4Q	1055	1088	One of the things I'll say, I'll say in regards to the idea, the concept of a Constitutional amendment is that when you deal with road maintenance and the fact that we have over $100 billion worth of road maintenance deficit right now, and it's gonna take, from what people tell me, even if we pass a significant revenue, it'll take a decade or maybe longer in some communities to overcome that deficit
6203	Gipson	Mike	28	DgVvXUz7n-U	870	894	many miraculous turnarounds in people's lives when the doctors have given up, when the doctors have said do funeral arrangements, and then the prognosis change in a matter of moments, in a matter of hours, a school board member, here in the City of Compton, was diagnosed with stage four cancer.
6204	Stone	Jeff	26	DwrMQLfFxcs	270	288	One is SB638 that focuses on community services and it seeks to address many of the concerns we'll be hearing about at today's hearing. It provides some immediate funding to shore up the current system, while at the same time working to develop long-term reforms to create a better more sustainable system for the future.
6205	Beall	Jim	92	nrJtkVtsuec	896	917	And the reason we were able to do that is because once the project commitment in the full-funding grant agreement was given, that is a financeable instrument that the local transit districts can then go in, as opposed to the state government selling a bond and giving them the money.
6206	Pan	Richard	96	BmeSyindq90	628	665	Certainly, we need to understand that you don't live in there school, you go home. People go home to an environment some people go home to a supportive environment, other students go home to much more challenging environments, and how does that interact so that we can identify those factors, because certainly our roles in government is certainly we want, you know, how do we support our schools and sometimes that means actually working on things that aren't necessarily directly education apparent, but actually will help out when the student shows up at school.
6207	Hill	Jerry	66	aimc434xzo4	136	159	And, more importantly, as it would be for whatever definition, it will prevent with the using the smoke-free laws, prohibit smoking in restaurants. I'm sorry, prohibit e-cigarettes and vaping in restaurants, bars, the workplace, healthcare hospitals, and all locations. So, regardless of what you call the definition, this bill will move us quite a bit forward, thank you. I respectfully ask for an aye vote, members.
6208	Stone	Mark	20	zjaMes6iB6Q	640	661	Back to my days on the school board, where we saw a lot kids who were given Ritalin, and it often seemed that it was more for the convenience of the parents and for the system rather than for the child itself, and I fear that a lot of the data around psychotropic drugs is very similarly situated.
6209	Hill	Jerry	66	y0NCxRtyQHE	728	747	In the minutes of your board of 9/11/13. There were approximately 75,398 nurses licensed between 1990 and 1998 that have paper fingerprint cards on file. So it looks like a large number, 75,938.
6210	Levine	Marc	8	24W2oeMkjbI	539	553	The analysis indicates that there will be no direct state costs as a result of the bill. If the bill moves forward, I'm committed to work with the opposition in hope to further clarify that these actions are voluntary and that the bill does not modify CEQA requirements. I respectfully request an aye vote today.
6211	Anderson	Joel	57	awDmkCorXdo	604	625	For two blocks around the lab, while they were dissembling it they had people evacuated for fear of it exploding. It's a different world. We're not talking about showing up in a urban setting. Or a rural setting. Where you know what you're up against. Without that training, we will continue to have a loss of life.
6212	Hueso	Ben	48	uAWOk1QkKOw	618	636	This year, an expected 350,000 individuals will suffer from a sudden cardiac arrest. Nine out of 10 of them will not survive. This work that we have started in San Diego has contributed to increasing survival rates.
6213	Chu	Kansen	32	V0SPq4LrZVk	832	848	As, Assembly Member Lopez presented, the foster parents play a vital role in our state by providing a safe and temporary home to children in the child welfare system.
6214	Chiu	David	7	6y6CtxPlgMo	1186	1202	This is a bill that would modernize and broaden the current HIV education mandate to reflect today's understanding of HIV and to increase our educational instructions impact on reducing HIV, sexually transmitted infections, and unintended pregnancies.
6215	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	CHPaC99Z-AQ	188	212	The current law only requires that Board of Parole hearings notify the victims or next of kin who request these notification, but omits the District Attorney in the process. This is problematic because DAs sometimes serve as the only voice for crime victims. AB 487 will close this loophole by adding notification requirement to the DAs when an inmate reques to advance a parole hearing.
6216	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	oC8-KbPE6Yo	201	216	And with that, we have I believe the Attorney General's office here to testify in support of the bill, and answer any technical questions you might have. I thank you for your consideration, and I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
6217	Hernandez	Roger	37	4sq_B6zlasQ	738	757	for Californians, and I think we should not be afraid of bigger turnouts. Bigger turnouts means we have more representative voices of our state telling us what they want when they want it. We've seen that in our elections that's why we have diversity here. We get elected in the bigger turnout elections the
6218	Wood	Jim	72	9fvwP7KwrvY	1367	1377	So I guess for the sake of the business and professional committee, or whatever, maybe that implementation costs there, but when you're talking about global costs, I have a hard time believing that that analysis so maybe-
6219	Bonta	Rob	85	Di5WyuYmeiA	416	432	Thank you, Dr. Pan. Okay, so, sorry, this is a little confusing. Now, we're gonna jump back up to sections G one, two, and three, collectively. This is the one that's a little different than the analysis. I'm gonna need your confirmation of acceptance of this amendment.
6220	Weber	Shirley	44	kIKVbsrTmqg	880	893	And so which is always the situation where you're basically having to give up something to get something else. You're pitting one program unfortunately against another or you either have to reduce something in order to begin the process of funding this one.
6221	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	itjqf4OHel4	125	152	SB 406 extends the California Family Rights Act job protections to employees working for an employer of 25 or more employees. Originally, I will tell you, this bill was measured at five employees. We recognized that there were some concerns about truly small businesses, so we increased that to 25 or more employees.
6222	Beall	Jim	92	898OiW72jWg	1534	1549	Yeah, I understand that. I agree. I think that the next step for me is to get the LAO and CalTrans to improve the zero base budgeting process so we have transparency in all those numbers.
6223	Maienschein	Brian	84	8M2h8_iX1Ao	1419	1434	Hold on Ma'am, just for one second. Just let me reiterate the words, the rules again for both sides. We've got to be fair to the both sides. We got it down to 16 minutes and 6 seconds, we had it down to the seconds. Your name, your city, and your position.
6224	Hill	Jerry	66	4cBASV3FSfM	1757	1773	I don't think that's necessary, but you did hear Mr Ramos' comments in the direction that he's moving the department from when he came on board. Did you hear anything that is inconsistent with what they're doing or have you seen anything have you had an opportunity to see the auditors report?
6225	Lara	Ricardo	107	ptq5V1Fu0ok	572	586	The motion is do pass to rules as amended. Amended to authorize lease agreements between dispensing opticians and optometrists and prohibit the enforcement of the existing prohibition until January 1, 2019. Secretary, please call the roll.
6226	Calderon	Ian Charles	115	K-Xyfp8wckY	109	125	bi-annual reports to the Department of Public Health to ensure safety for both patients and physicians. AB 159 is simple. If you, your parent, or your child are faced with a terminal illness, then there is a process in place for you to seek potentially life-saving treatments.
6227	Lara	Ricardo	107	qTf-RqJKEFo	913	932	Thank you. Again, members, thank you for allowing me to present this bill. Of course we will continue work with DWR on other possible solutions. The issues you have brought today make sense and we will make sure that we look, into those as this bill continues to move forward. Thank you.
6228	Roth	Richard	106	WgBOQU7UIHU	2122	2140	But we mean as a state, we may not run very many of these facilities as defined. So that's why, I see you clarified that for me and then in terms of what this bill does, is it accurate that it's gonna apply to new construction after January 1, 2020?
6229	Leno	Mark	60	D32BRjJtFrw	1117	1148	Let the LAO respond to that, but with regard to our Bay Area Rapid Transit district, we have the highest rates of ridership that we ever have, and there's now talk about is there need for a second tunnel. They're in the process of buying more cars so we can add more cars to the trains because the demand is so great. It's not always so pleasant at rush hour to get a seat on one of those trains or even standing room, but that's just one of the many benefits. Miss Bosler, you're happy to comment? Mr. Brown, and then we're gonna conclude.
6230	Leno	Mark	60	4mB1nCFXohc	359	380	I think one of our big successes among the many last year, when we established the 60%, was creating a new and dedicated revenue source for transit in California for the first time. And so I don't know that we can ever invest enough in it. So I would align my comments with both yours and Senator Beall's.
6231	Nazarian	Adrin	36	-OpN4Uo7BxE	377	391	Also the duration of each step is up to the health plan and has been known to last up to 90 days. AB 374 simply allows, a prescribing physician based on his/ her professional judgement to request the Step Therapy Override on behalf of a patient.
6232	Pavley	Fran	104	Ab32yuFXwvM	560	584	And they said, you know, but they do have a UIC program that they are engaged in and keeping track of. But I wanted to spend, with the Chair's permission, just a few minutes walking through some history. And then, really framing discussion from the Chair of the Natural Resources and Water Committee's points of view.
6233	Leno	Mark	60	GObd4JWklwI	21	49	The order of agenda will be Heath, Human Services, Resources, Transportation, Public Safety, Judicial Labor, State Administration, Higher Education K-12 and Childcare and then there are a number of Supplemental report language items that we will deal with at the very end.
6234	Thurmond	Tony	4	HBOX_ihiZFg	579	591	There are many who were disappointed by what wasn't in the state budget. But many of those folks who were disappointed, did not get an opportunity to have a special session. Now, I'm not saying that that's enough. It's not.
6235	Hertzberg	Robert	99	_QWOBYYvqfo	1259	1268	You know, you've got a whole fundamental change. This is one piece of this really big chessboard that we need to that we need to really think about. So, Senator Pavley.
6236	Mitchell	Holly	64	nJVEC9_ZdZM	238	260	Thank you. With that, again on the top of page 37 of the agenda, I will make a motion that we approve the May revise adjusted for any actions adopted elsewhere in the agenda. And again request that DDS and LAO report back to the subcommittee next year on the issue of the Federal Matching Funds estimate methodology.
6237	Chiu	David	7	2QITrr6350o	802	822	a survivor could only terminate a lease through a much more owner's process, which is dangerous for survivors, particularly immigrants for whom English is not their first language. AB 418 would also decrease the remaining rent required for someone to leave from 30 to 14 days funds desperately needed by survivors for new housing.
6238	Beall	Jim	92	6Zm0lSVJfAE	1525	1543	And I remember the twins, two kids that got hurt in a swimming accident as babies and Santi took care of them, these children, made sure they were placed in a good home.
6239	Wieckowski	Bob	55	9XK-JIdAIck	1375	1400	And if there's a dual benefit of adaptation and mitigation, it's a green light. What happens in those instances where there's a conflict between an adaptation policy and mitigation. For instance, if we have vector problems, we increase pest control, or pesticide application. Or we have prescribed burning in order to sustain our forests.
6240	McGuire	Mike	93	JX8xAEiw8s4	447	499	And with each change in placement, we deepen impact. Our child welfare and mental health systems are established to focus primarily on the mental health needs of kids, who have severe behaviors as a result of untreated trauma. Children's mental health services appear to be focused on services for kids and teens whose needs were never met earlier in the child's involvement with the child welfare system. The state system must include, we have to include an in depth assessment for signs of trauma, for every child that enters the child welfare system. And it should establish a continuum of services, that addresses their needs up front and early on, rather than requiring their needs to fit into the narrow boxes of services that we've created over many decades.
6241	Mitchell	Holly	64	Kjr9dgLkxFI	293	341	And we've asked everyone to limit their time to five minutes. Ms. Bartholow and Mr. Mecca, I'd ask you to be particularly, thank you. Mr. Mecca's going to stick to two, because I think hearing from the clients and Ms. Theroux, who's joining us for the first time on this panel will be very helpful. The Sergeant.  Right and we'll hear from you all in this order we'll hear from the clients, Mr. Knighton, Jamie Sawyers then Ms. Bartholow, Ms. Theroux and we'll end with Mr. Mecca.
6242	Moorlach	John	4657	dCf0VaDDxwk	1350	1363	And where does that originate from? Why go through the hoops and all these gyrations when the federal government, it's sort of like our money anyway, right? I mean we paid, they've got it, they could send some back.
6243	McGuire	Mike	93	Pvh7fZV71H4	34	48	I apologize that you have to see this mug again. I'm going to make this very brief. Ladies and gentlemen, we are excited to be able to represent and bring forward SB 747, the Local Airport and Investment and Improvement Act.
6244	Thurmond	Tony	4	uCE_G6_xZh8	195	204	Ms. Harveston, I didn't give you a chance. Did you have anything else from finance, not just on this question, but in general? Good. Mr. Martin, anything from the LAO?
6245	Holden	Chris	78	6dKd_uGq3Mo	238	258	Each of the, the changes proposed are modeled after states with balanced franchise law, New Jersey, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Rhode Island. There are no shortage of franchise burger stands and doughnut shops in these states. In fact, numerous corporations are headquartered in these states, which have strong franchise laws.
6246	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	n81cNAsH1gw	34	55	Thank you Mister Chair and members. I'd like to present AB 1300. This bill is a, attempt to streamline the process by which we deal with our mentally ill population that end up in health facilities.
6247	Gordon	Richard	117	Ai7oaVN8l2E	419	432	How long we're going to be in this current condition? And I accept that we may need to do some of these things immediately, but my preference would be that you would have had some sunset at some points, just a comment, thank you.
6248	Leyva	Connie	62	8UaA3ArF3qo	1122	1136	So an inmate who's receiving either healthcare or mental care when they're when they're released do you work with them or does the prison work with it to make that transition to the outside to help them continue treatment?
6249	McGuire	Mike	93	kjbtobUTSlE	974	993	morning in his Santa Rosa home Treoni was a navy veteran an astute buisinessman, he was once the largest individual stockholder in Wells Fargo Bank. He was a wise financier made successive fortunes that mirrored the evolution of the north coast including investments and timber real estate banking and Sonoma county
6250	Weber	Shirley	44	0JpwnSkUZnE	1963	1979	And I think that's extremely important. So it's good that all of you have come and brought a number of wonderful suggestions, and workshops, and seminars, and outreach programs that I can tell you without the will, we've had a lot of these programs before, it will not happen. Thank you for coming, though.
6251	Bates	Pat	58	xDQm4xTXlMg	1050	1071	Yes, Assemblymember Bloom you have committed to providing or being concerned and supportive of the industry finding a pathway. It just doesn't seem to me that the bill, as it's currently presented with only four years, that that's a pathway. If we're talking about our R and D to the level that you are requiring to ensure that when it
6252	Galgiani	Cathleen	95	dfTR-5X2bxg	321	347	Okay, so this bill doesn't deal with that, or touch that at all? This just deals with the compensation issue? Okay, I ask that question because when I bought my last home, it was a situation where the developer was requiring new owners to work with their particular lender and there were issues about that and so I'm prepared to move the bill. I don't know if my colleague has any questions or if you?
6253	Liu	Carol	63	WPX0fE7wHjw	40	68	However, this program is currently not codified in state statute, and could be eliminated at any time at the discretion of the Governor and CDCR. SB 224 will do two things; codify the existing program, and expand the eligibility for the program to inmates fifty years and older, and who have served fifteen years on their current sentence.
6254	Frazier	Jim	114	8ZmrJUXXU4k	946	962	And so, to acknowledge that they are doing a days work for a living wage has to be acknowledged. And so I'm looking forward to this bill moving forward through the legislature, but on a point of Mr. Medina's questioning.
6255	Hertzberg	Robert	99	phnFAAdDWJg	847	869	You know there's a great example. I'm just gonna stick it in your ear a little bit, on purpose; because, I came back to cause a little noise. LA County, that has the storm water recapture in the San Gabriel Valley is 100% successful. You guys in the San Fernando valley that me and my coach over here represent, get 15% of their ground water at the San Fernando valley. Why is that the case?
6256	Block	Marty	59	JgUoeRvgl3U	300	314	Thank you, Madame Chair. Yeah, Ms. Fried raises reasonable, very reasonable, concerns and I'm pleased the author is gonna be continuing to work with the UC on this. With the amendments taken, however, this clearly is a bill that deserves support and I will be supporting it.
6257	Nazarian	Adrin	36	nugSHhjUz14	1573	1598	Last, but not least, we worked with the LAO office and included budget bill language requiring the Department of Justice to consult with the BOE and the Department of Finance to develop and report on the proposal for a statutory change related to reducing program costs and streamlining the tobacco licensing program.
6258	Bonta	Rob	85	0pvN33z5LJg	776	789	So, it's a little bit perplexing to say that you don't want more resources to help pull down more funding, but, but, so I'm trying to understand that, and I think I got a sense of where you're headed. So, thank you.
6259	Stone	Jeff	26	bB6-EJZQbO8	1214	1228	Hank Kato was a loving husband. He was a proud grandfather. More than that, he was a proud American who loved his family. He loved his country and he loved his Los Angeles Angels. He will be sorely missed by those who knew and loved him. My heart goes out to his wife, Marge, his daughter Terry, and her husband Donald, his granddaughter Melanie and her husband Brian, and my good friend Richard.
6260	Nguyen	Janet	65	hqvUVHybZBI	160	177	The students that are most affected by Corinthian closures tend to be the low-income Californians and also veterans. It's not physically responsible for the state to burden these students with income tax that they can't afford, and at no fault of their own.
6261	Stone	Jeff	26	bB6-EJZQbO8	1184	1199	I learned a lot from Hank and I'm saddened by his passing; however, his lessons of taught me much. He was a modest man, he never spoke ill of anyone, and his biggest loves were his family and his church.
6262	Mendoza	Tony	52	E1_HgghcmCU	2179	2195	To report to the legislature on the changes into regulation in the statute that will help achieve a level playing field and foster innovation. Including whether other passenger vehicles being used by charter party carriers should also be considered as noncommercial. Just kinda looking into the ...
6263	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	43wK_WUALhw	1117	1147	So again, I think what we just heard, I think, is going to be very important in that regard. But the other three elements actually do deal with economic issues or two of the four, the childcare is of course when people spend 70% of their net disposable income on childcare, it leaves them without enough money for anything else, but in terms of workplaces and in terms of minimum wage and economic opportunities, that's probably a good segue here.
6264	Moorlach	John	4657	898OiW72jWg	284	313	In my 20 years in elected office, I had a lot of fun running a department, and I had to do these analyses. Is it better to go external and outsource, or is it better to go internal and do it internally? What are the costs, what are the benefits? And I will tell you that there are a lot of reasons to keep staff internal. We saved a lot of money doing our own investing, doing our own tax collecting.
6265	Gomez	Jimmy	80	7bdBeI04iMY	1667	1683	Mr speakerand members today I'm presenting Assembly bill 1205 which will establish the Cal River program which would be a grant program and administered by the natural resources agency this competitive grant program will be used to fund projects on or adjacent to
6266	Stone	Jeff	26	iTrvWXqiedk	1963	1986	But I agree with Senator Monning that the placement of these stop signs not only is in peculiar locations, but in some cases, it's just hard to see them. And so what municipalities are doing today is they're putting solar innervated lights, red lights that are flashing, so that you can see them if they're in a obscure area.
6267	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	g465sM88Jms	1645	1663	The 90 days allows two things. One, the worker to prepare if they're not going to have a job anymore. But two, it also allows the worker to be able to make their case to the employer, you know, and I think a lot of times that that, given that opportunity there's a lot of fear, I think, when employers come in, especially if there's a unionized work force.
6268	Frazier	Jim	114	ALBLkuC1R9Q	0	9	So I'm going to call this hearing to order and I want to welcome members of the Assembly Transportation Committee, and the members of the Assembly Budget Committee Sub Three
6269	Mendoza	Tony	52	QlhPNwq6ivY	23	34	Because obviously in the reports you produce, a lot of the state legislatures use this information to either to regulate or during the budget process begin to help support certain programs and certain efforts.
6270	McCarty	Kevin	22	sx5Murt3em4	1764	1776	None the less, that, those are tens of millions of dollars in the future that could be used for core academic support, and so as you proceed with your presentation just want you to keep this this question in mind is that.
6271	Fuller	Jean	49	0MzTgkt-Llc	298	321	If and if that gets to be a problem and some people get called on another people don't call on it, we'll talk about later, but that helps everybody who's listening know that the technical area a is where the desk go on the floor and they have been great about seeing us along the edges and somewhere just right on the inside of the curtains and just on this side.
6272	Mendoza	Tony	52	JT1Tm7zEIWc	8	20	Thank you, any others? Seeing none, we'll go ahead and bring it back to the Committee and have members ask questions. We'll start with Senator Jackson, I believe she had a question.
6273	Runner	Sharon	4656	SQEMna8rhH0	1521	1561	Several that couldn't be here today that are in support. Association of Code Enforcement Officers, Association of Deputy District Attorneys, California College and University Police Chiefs Association, The California Narcotics Officers Association, of course, Crime Victims United, Los Angeles Police Department, LA Sheriff's Department, Los Angeles Police Protection League, Riverside Sheriff's Association, and former Senator George Runner, who's Board of Equalization right now. So I have Charlie here for any questions you might have that are specific to the bill but I'd ask for an aye vote.
6274	Lara	Ricardo	107	qbKF38sndDw	1176	1204	AB 305, workers compensation permanent disability apportionment. Do pass to the Senate Floor. We will substitute the roll of AB 2. That bill is approved on a five to two vote, with Republicans voting no. Next item is AB 1266, electrical and gas corporations. Do pass as amended per author to define access compensation at $1 million and to make restrictions valid for five years after triggering event. We will substitute the roll from AB 2.
6275	Hadley	David	40	maPB0VHfdFQ	1537	1557	Mr. Speaker members I rise today is a principle co-author of ACR 43 and I urge your support for this measure. Throughout history California has led the world in aerospace advancements from the engineers who built Orion's Spirit of Saint Louis for Charles one birds famous flight to NASA's team at the jet propulsion laboratory who landed the curiosity rover on the surface of Mars.
6276	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	UpjsW9YiW28	1748	1765	Thank you so much. Any witnesses in opposition? Please come forward. You can come forward, please. If you would just come to the table here. Okay? Two minutes. Thank you.
6277	Pavley	Fran	104	Q3p12T-SoaE	1172	1202	And, there's more and more information coming out because of the types of jobs people get, have to have, in juggling child care, and their jobs, and the changing times of jobs, and I just know that as a teacher, even changing one or two days in a school year schedule is a huge deal and a huge problem in trying to fill in that gap.
6278	Monning	Bill	25	uggbUvzVWb8	1919	1942	then graduate from high school and are the prime candidates to end up in the criminal justice system. Where we end up paying $50,000 a year so, I'm glad to be supporting this today. I want to thank the author for bringing it forward and please convey our thanks to the Attorney General for her continued prioritization and to those who are doing the important front line community work. Thank you.
6279	Mitchell	Holly	64	SNbIvbnUyMw	1287	1314	And that they're clear that you have a new, different expectation in terms of performance and again, creating this culture shift, so the notion of fear around duties is not a healthy environment, nor does it reflect well on Californians who have to live with the work that's done. Can we move on to Exide?
6280	Hertzberg	Robert	99	qmwCF9xPDEw	27	49	This bill is really another form of oversight, and I think a more elegant way. Four years ago, the state committed itself to a statewide recycling goal to be met by 2020. And, you ask yourself, we could go and hold oversight hearings and say, well, in 2020 did you make it? Well, 52%.
6281	Hall	Isadore	1	bP5invw1wi4	396	410	Okay, that's out. We'll keep the roll open for about three minutes for the absent members. And Item 2, SB 539 Glazer, I believe Senator Hill moved that bill. Madam Secretary, please call the roll.
6282	Allen	Benjamin	70	Ydll29eHOng	1144	1152	So, for the many perfect moments and enduring memories, Leonard Nimoy provided, the State of California stands in his debt and I ask that we adjourn in his memory today.
6283	Weber	Shirley	44	jsGbKJLFERc	227	245	Right, I think one of our issues and concerns was also that as we looked at whether or not the third group would be receiving any benefits, my assumption is that some of the persons hired are gonna be the ones developing and consulting with the third section.
6284	Waldron	Marie	29	gmyBR_4Q_cg	1291	1308	Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'll, I'll be supporting the bill today, but I do have the, the concern what the emergency room physician was saying because, I mean, I would assume. Maybe this is just an assumption on my part that someone comes in for an emergency,
6285	De Leon	Kevin	102	Mt9BcU600uM	36	48	Senator Connie Leyva, bien bien benida, como siempre. We have just one absence today, obviously that is Senator Fuller who is tending to some personal issues back in the district.
6286	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	KZTa69-ElFQ	638	660	Okay. Thank you. And so, now I'll make a brief comment. I'm also on Public Safety and there's been a lot of bills coming through and different permutations of how do we deal with human trafficking, and for the first time the chair, Mr. Quirk and I, along with Miguel Santiago, Assembly member, we said we need to come up with a comprehensive plan.
6287	Weber	Shirley	44	8YNqtXYvNaM	862	871	And they sat there, scratching their heads forever, and the fire continued to expand. And we looked kinda crazy because we had resources sitting next to the fire that we didn't use.
6288	Harper	Matthew	14	Y6LWzDb2ask	401	434	He eventually became President of the Costa Mesa Police Reserves Association. Throughout his life he was an active member of the Costa Mesa Chamber of Commerce and the Costa Mesa Planning Commission. There, he helped create the each help shape the future growth of his beloved city. He went to run for the City Council and served as mayor of Costa Mesa from 1972 to 1974. He was instrumental in the creation of the Bristol Park Nomadical Group and the Twinkle Park in Mesa Delmar, and the Corona Delmar Freeway. He also led the effort to enact changes to the Orange County airport flight pattern.
6289	Harper	Matthew	14	I1DeZTgw_DI	1460	1470	And so, each of these employers have been working in a way to be able to be attractive enough for employees to be able to show up on a holiday.
6290	Burke	Autumn	6	0lsNxjB7bP8	1604	1622	I could understand that would be apples to apples. But Uber with T&Cs are not, I'm echoing, T&Cs are not taxi cab companies, they don't function the same way. And the reality is, is companies like Google, any search engine, does collect all of your data and aggregate that data.
6291	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	b7XHatlYhkw	1594	1615	I think and I share your concern, but the way the bill reads as I understand it is that if you reveal a protected disclosure or this protects against retribution, if you will for a protected disclosure that is made to an enumerated body.
6292	Leno	Mark	60	YKXU5BUfkbE	136	152	but makes some distinctive and important changes in program spending, reflecting Senate democratic caucus priorities. The center piece of it is reinvestment in a stage child care and early learning system.
6293	Block	Marty	59	p-XnER8ca7c	1488	1515	Thank you, Madame Chair. Have a question for Ms. Wenzel. A few years ago I authored a bill AB 2296 which called on the Bureau to set regulations that would govern information for students, making information available on these private for-profit schools, websites, and written information to inform or warn students about
6294	Pavley	Fran	104	TrPgAQvjTc0	606	629	Let's continue this journey and I want to thank a Senator Kevin De Leon for his outstanding leadership. The governor has been supportive of these goals and policies for many years and I look forward to working with all of you to implement this bill from now and into the future. Ask for you aye vote.
6295	Hall	Isadore	1	Xjq2sHgkTwU	1149	1177	Not one person in the legislature has done that. And yet we have to go and be selected to serve on a jury of a potential family member that we've placed away, or a partner of a gang that has been placed away. And giving information about one's family.
6296	De Leon	Kevin	102	YuFgB6EIE5U	918	941	But this is an ongoing issues with regards to some of the figures that were discussed with regards to pre-alignments in every other fiscal year subsequently where we've had some cost savings, you know, in some fiscal years and the recent fiscal year obviously we've gone above and beyond the last-- the prior fiscal year.
6297	Stone	Jeff	26	Pt2Dhj6vkoE	1621	1646	While this is a good attempt to start minimizing that exposure, do you see any time in the future, and I'll get to the LAO in just a second. Do you see any time in the future when we really match the private sector in not offering this very generous benefit, especially at a time when we have ObamaCare that's supposed to be taking a lot of this responsibility over.
6298	Hancock	Loni	98	Oc8_cozASuQ	476	519	Thank you. I also want to thank Judge Cordell for very specific recommendations, and I'm actually quite interested in knowing if members of the panel have thoughts about any of those. I'm particularly interested in the issue of prohibiting grand juries on the grounds that very much like internal investigation, you're dealing with people who work together every day and may depend on collegial relationships.
6299	Williams	Das	12	td32uLu5rbg	108	132	So again if people want to do bills that's like the Sacramento Kings bill what they would want to do is identify a specific project, go to the supporters in opposition, have them meet together come up with the mitigation measures, this is not been done in either case. That is the reason for our noe recommendation.
6300	Bloom	Richard	2	Rt-g3tEX78Q	1486	1506	While in the military, Nimoy started his first film, which launched him into his career as a professional actor. He played more than 50 small parts in B movies and television series including appearances on "Bonanza," "The Rubble," "The Untouchables," and The Virginian" just to name a few.
6301	Roth	Richard	106	YmgQ9S1o328	176	189	Okay, well the staff recommendation is to approve this budget. And, obviously, I was an advocate for this to the extent that we can add the cape when it first came up. I just am concerned about the applicability of this 15201, without some modification.
6302	Thurmond	Tony	4	merVIEmEWtA	1615	1628	Because I can imagine that even with these great campaigns there's still barriers. And we don't want families to miss out on something that is a help to them. What does our outreach need to look like? What's good outreach?
6303	Patterson	Jim	119	5jUUOwMdhxk	9	36	And I would request deference to the fact that I hold a chair. Given the response, the clear interest in my question elicited a response. There is a request by the Chamber to clarify this. I think that's a reasonable request, and I'd like to ask for the prerogative of asking the Chamber to respond.
6304	Pavley	Fran	104	FapiTOGMI3c	1270	1295	We know that we've had problems with 2,500 wells that the United States Environmental Protection Agency called to our attention. We are gradually reviewing them now. So, this bill will look at also review all the rules and regulations, just on a regular ten year basis. If nothing needs to be reviewed or changed, fine.
6305	Wood	Jim	72	cBCfsH22JkY	1006	1031	Yes Mr. Rendon, this specifically with respect to 1490, thank you for bringing both bills. My concern is that I in the district I represent we have significant geothermal wells that generates a lot of renewable energy. And so as I read this, we also have seismic activity. It's very, very consistent up there, has been forever which is why the steam fields exist anyway.
6306	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	nkFf3IHgULc	1893	1917	That's interesting. I think our jurisdiction is the question of fairness in the negotiations and the balance between the two, because I see this as really a question of who's got more power. It's a little bit like the franchise bill to the extend that, do we go with the manufactures?
6307	Allen	Benjamin	70	hOtjCIoL344	5	22	It's my understanding that, Senator, that first of all this is an extraordinary museum. This is kind of a statewide treasure heritage spot. And they bring in educators from all over the state to give them curriculum and tools.
6308	De Leon	Kevin	102	SNbIvbnUyMw	910	927	Obviously, the leaders themselves, but what it does, it gives us an insight that is beyond the leadership issue, because someone doesn't show up on an average of a year, lets say average ten years, ten directors average one year, and say, 'we're outta here'.
6309	Bonta	Rob	85	m48b5iZN1Uo	231	242	This is the committees fifth year as many of you know and I think my colleagues will agree that in this fifth year we are reinvigorated, re-inspired, and impatient for change.
6310	Hernandez	Ed	103	JM1ztwrhmks	1599	1611	And in light of this, does your company believe that you have a moral obligation to price your products at a level that is accessible? So that's my question to you.
6311	Cooley	Ken	45	_GNket01HEA	709	729	So, the ability of having people trained to understand the physical relationship of what's going on with the behavior and have a well informed opinion on that before you start trying to come to any conclusions. It is an evaluation, but it's very much founded in a medical opinion and
6312	Bonilla	Susan	3	1O51OMdLA-4	546	573	wanting to partake in outside venues but they said, you know, we have a problem that there are no changing places for our disabled children or disabled adults that we have. This bill AB 662 would institute that in places that have over 1000 visitors a day that they would need to provide in the future for an adult changing facility.
6313	Roth	Richard	106	m8iyuGdEmL0	1338	1360	The concept of expedited review I thought was important because we're, we're putting a to get to the part of the bill that was heard yesterday, we're putting a 90 day period on the opportunity to correct could be a fairly short period depending on the nature and extent of the, of the repairs and alternations it require especially if they're structural.
6314	Hill	Jerry	66	mZDplXo566U	256	281	The other question that I want to respond to is I know, and this is related to dig-ins and the, there's a perfect picture graph in here that really shows that the lines that you can see in the graph, the green line, are dig-ins that where dig-in is where a contractor digs into and breaks a pipe and causes could be a devastating problem.
6315	Melendez	Melissa	41	_3f-5R48ZaU	1521	1533	That is all we've been doing, Senator Leyva and I have worked out an entire plan that we think is pretty workable. Just side barring up here. We'll be happy to share it with you, Mr. Chairman when we're done.
6316	Hill	Jerry	66	mZDplXo566U	979	998	Last August, the Safety Subcommittee of the Energy Committee had an electric grid hearing, one in which both of you presented at that hearing. At the end of the hearing, I brought to Miss Malashenko's attention something that appeared to be a clear public records act violation on the part of the commission that was related to a safety issue.
6317	Chiu	David	7	VuyRexRzUE4	1309	1332	I'd love to get that, and then my second follow-up I know there have been many innovative programs around the state to help individuals with disabilities get into the job market, employment skills training, have there been surveys of the best programs that are out there and what programs we ought to be considering supporting over others?
6318	Dahle	Brian	47	fSCMT0VJDKw	34	47	The current law does not allow logo signs in areas with population greater than 5,000. Truckee is slightly above that at 16,000, which exceeds the definition of rural. This will not make the lines shorter at the DMV.
6319	Pan	Richard	96	BQgV9eqQ2Tw	1029	1053	Consider the story of Opower from San Francisco, a company built directly from government publication of residential energy surveys. Opower unlocked the value of the data and directly created 400 family wage local jobs, a multibillion dollar industry, and up to 50% savings for local energy ratepayers. This translates into direct savings for working families, less energy consumption, and jobs.
6320	De Leon	Kevin	102	7zm3gwdT-l0	382	401	But the expansion of slots in itself don't guarantee that these students of these zip codes will actually get, you may have the unintended consequence by expanding the slots itself that you will continue to perpetuate the same cycle of pipeline from certain zip codes to the UC system.
6321	Lara	Ricardo	107	3F-MRhTliC4	155	167	Members, debate or discussion on this item? Debate or discussion? Seeing and hearing none, is there any objection to utilizing a previous unanimous roll call. There is objection. Secretary, please call the roll.
6322	Wood	Jim	72	2gM15KHmKpo	848	862	Americans, while you've heard from a couple of advocacy groups here for patients, Americans for safe access has no position on this so all of the bills including 266, and you heard the concern about collectives, are moving away from collectives.
6323	Mitchell	Holly	64	elxm9FjpDgY	105	120	Okay I'm sorry. I was having a side-bar and I'm too old to do two things at once really well? Did you, I heard at the very end you said that something might have something to do with the reduction the teen birth rate. Teen pregnancy rate.
6324	Wood	Jim	72	UqQcd0TyhPE	1516	1523	I also don't believe that people who do not have that kind of an educational background should use that. I think that that's where the consumer protection comes in.
6325	Lara	Ricardo	107	qM5DAHMb8ig	1527	1540	That's very, you know, a lot of the folks are using the, are using our emergency room care, are using it as some sort of preventative care, which is not appropriate, cuz, you know, this should be limited toward, towards emergencies.
6326	Gatto	Mike	46	1ddkqgmLsnY	1765	1780	And hand write something and saying this is a trust amendment and I give my whole property to blah blah blah and that happens. I know several, several instances where that has happened, where there's been an allegation of fraud within a trust, so we actually think this by being indeed something certain, something that has to be notarized, something that has to be recorded.
6327	Dodd	Bill	71	sOBgcRfjdRA	211	225	I appreciate the opportunity to be here. I think this is something that I appreciate the chair calling this hearing, and looking forward to hearing testimony. Bill Dodd. District four Assembly.
6328	Mendoza	Tony	52	g1KhSxf2FKA	453	465	Yes, I didn't serve on the county board of supervisors, but I've noticed that everybody that has served on the county board of supervisors, especially in these counties that are being affected, well they love that power and not want to give it up. And so they oppose this vehemently.
6329	Cooper	Jim	21	0BI7ZwRm0UU	1373	1386	But, you know, body cameras need, I support body cameras. But it's just crafting that language that hits that sweet spot. And it's really not hiding anything. I think body cameras in the end will benefit law enforcement.
6330	Glazer	Steve	10481	RplCDWdFT8I	1245	1266	We do have current law on privacy now. I share your concern about privacy and the courts do on occasion have to interpret those rules on privacy that are in our state and national constitutions. But, again so where is there been a problem that we are trying to solve with the state legislation?
6331	Hernandez	Ed	103	m25jL11Z0rE	1336	1354	Any other, any other comments? Is there a motion? Move by Senator Wolk. I'll just make a comment. Appreciate you moving the issue forward there. School screenings in the state of California is a mandated, I believe it's kindergarten, first grade, third, eighth, ninth grade.
6332	Nguyen	Janet	65	m25jL11Z0rE	1327	1335	So I thank you for making an effort to work with the opposition and so that we can get to the right place, because this is the right thing to do. Thank you.
6333	Quirk	Bill	23	RplCDWdFT8I	1228	1244	Frankly, if we don't have something like this it's all gonna go to the courts and the courts will decide what the courts will decide. Here we're going to get clarity ahead of time when you need a warrant, when you don't, and that's I think much better than just leaving it to the courts.
6334	Leyva	Connie	62	t4_AyYAahhk	257	273	And in talking to adjunct professors who are running from campus to campus, not only is it hard on the students, it's hard on them, so I think we should always endeavor in every level of work, up and down the state to make sure there are more and more full-time positions available.
6335	Huff	Bob	105	52URYfZsNNs	418	432	Aand they either implement the types of policies that they want and the safety around the kinds or they get rid of them and I personally don't see that we need to weigh in on something it looks like-- I get that some people feel military equipment just.
6336	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	ZnhfCEAKzDU	1309	1332	Unless a local law calls for living wage, in which case, of course that's what they should be earning. Payment for overtime paid sick leaves and workers' compensation in the event of an injury. Specifically, this bill will also hold that professional sports teams accountable for the employment practices for their chosen contractor subject to last year's AB 1897 authored by assembly member Hernandez, whether or not that work was performed in a stadium or at an outside event.
6337	Gomez	Jimmy	80	-R4HGT4UbOs	358	391	In addition to touring the state capital, they will be visiting the State Train Museum, Sutter's Fort, the Historic Coloma Gold Fields, and the Donner Party State Park. Most importantly, although they're from Orange County, at least the littlest one is a Dodgers fan. I'm very glad that they're here. Let's give them a big round of applause.
6338	Olsen	Kristin	15	d_EaaILk1VE	989	1000	In appropriations committee, in rev and tax committee, there's always a hearing where the suspense file gets voted on and I think ACA 1 deserves the opportunity to actually receive a vote.
6339	De Leon	Kevin	102	iXqi4cKnhU8	547	560	So, we've seen this time and time again and there's always a perception that the outside vendors are much more smarter, are much more quicker and nimble, you know, and, there's, you know, what happens here?
6340	Block	Marty	59	_QWOBYYvqfo	1107	1120	The fact that 77% of EV owners express dissatisfaction with the public charging infrastructure sends a bad signal to their neighbors, their friends, their family who are considering electric vehicle purchase.
6341	Mitchell	Holly	64	zKRXexcG8LM	1743	1766	Again, under the current practice, the distribution of forfeiture proceeds go, according to this percentage break down, 65% of asset forfeiture proceeds are distributed to law enforcement, 10% to the prosecuting agency, 24% of the general fund, and 1% for training a prosecutors on asset forfeiture.
6342	Levine	Marc	8	G3ANKG_a4vY	668	695	Thank you Dr. Bamforth. And so, I have a question about the hops. And I'm not sure if Dr. Watson might be able to lend some insight on that. But as there's more brewing taking place, and particularly hoppy brews, how is that affecting our access to the commodity and are trends shifting because of those limits?
6343	Wieckowski	Bob	55	Oggr1OKYFzQ	1805	1825	I said how does the creditors that this money is owed, how do they collect on it? And the current law says you can garnish 25% of someone's disposable income. And the bill at it's basic saying well that's too high because these people, they'll lose their job or they'll file for bankruptcy. 10% is a more reasonable.
6344	Williams	Das	12	_Z7ChiMRbIg	556	582	I think they can be on board, at least the domestic battery industry on board, is because if we approach this right, we'll create a situation where both of them have the same level playing field. Frankly the amount of waste that's produced by a more short-lived battery from overseas is a lot more waste, and it costs more money for local folks.
6345	Grove	Shannon	77	adewtR6e1X4	541	557	If we've done Agnews in eight years, and we did more people in Agnews than we have available in the facilities now. Again, we're not talking about Porterville, nobody is. Four years for Lantermen, and we have 10 years on the books now. What's 18 months, 2 years? How come we can't do it in two years?
6346	Thurmond	Tony	4	nugSHhjUz14	653	666	Having said that, we're glad that the Sub 1 committee and the budget process was able to provide a way to restore the 10% cuts to Medi-Cal in a phased approach. 5% one year, and 5% the next year.
6347	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	q7AsDi_3G1o	646	668	Alright. There you go. Anybody in opposition? OK, no opposition. Any members of thecommittee who wish to speak? Seeing no Members of the Committee, there's been a motion, there's been a second. The motion is do pass asamended to Appropriations.
6348	Hancock	Loni	98	kIQkyQM4CnQ	231	248	Well I think that's a number we all ought to have right off the top of our head. And I hope that next year, I've already said I want us to start this series of meetings with the pie chart of the $9 or $10 billion that we spend on corrections.
6349	Perea	Henry	33	xJqN87zbSDI	1513	1528	The advanced deployment of electric vehicles and significant increases in building efficiency requires a coordinated approach between state agencies and the legislature and the scoping plan has proven to be a useful tool to guide sound policy decisions.
6350	Gordon	Richard	117	wr_Nl1-RdXY	1047	1060	I was actually gonna ask if we could do that because I'd like to get my staff to do a quick check. The final item is gonna be cap and trade, so If we take this up after we have the cap and trade discussion-
6351	Calderon	Ian Charles	115	nZHmIMh0aaI	1060	1084	I'm gonna want to fight in a lower weight class to increase my odds of being victorious. But if sometimes you just can't get there because you physically cannot drop that much weight, are there any type of standards that specifically this Athletic Commission has in dealing with that issue? Or is it more of UFC, MMA organization? If you could clarify.
6352	Calderon	Ian Charles	115	nZHmIMh0aaI	1036	1060	What protections exist, and this isn't necessarily say it's a you problem, but it does concern you, what protections are in place? How many times can a fighter miss weight before they have to be reclassified into another class? Or, I mean, are there any types of standards that say, okay, if fighters are proving, because I understand.
6353	De Leon	Kevin	102	oE98JCD72Xk	536	563	So this will be one of probably many, maybe not as large as this one, at least today, but many of them will be coming down the pipeline. One thing I wanna add, two things here, Mr. Harper, is there was a claim, it wasn't done today, but it was done last week. And just for your consideration, that and it goes to jobs, specifically.
6354	Leno	Mark	60	jAn9ObwSR14	845	869	So, in effect we were the beneficiary of this parallel effort with the US attorney because at the time we communicated to Exide that their permit was going to be denied they have no other business in California. They could have left the state and left us holding the bag, right? I mean we didn't really have leverage ourselves.
6355	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	L_fXwOpVblo	93	133	I just wanted to make sure though that I understood the amount of stuff they have about us, right? You know, I think we talked and I don't know... I don't think I can support this bill. I think that the work that is being done is so critical and I'm worried about... I know there is a newborn screening test pamphlet that's given to parents, I don't remember myself with my children, it's been quite a few years but I don't remember the exact process, but the critical work that is done I think and the fact that California is at the leading edge of that critical work is something that I can't ignore.
6356	Leno	Mark	60	H9sj-95HbgQ	125	136	All this does is require that those who are gonna be placing them consider the child's sexual identity as they make their placement, so I ask for your aye vote.
6357	Leno	Mark	60	OHqd1YALBQA	326	347	How could you honestly argue that the front of the how should get it and not the back of the house because there's not a plate to put on a table if it weren't for the dishwashers and the chefs in the back. So, maybe it makes greater sense that tips are shared. And, that would address that subject.
6358	Cannella	Anthony	61	ocHLYdjgc30	573	580	And that not only adds to dirty air, but it also affects quality of life when folks can't get home or get to where they need to go rapidly.
6359	Block	Marty	59	Gi3isrmpDzA	1126	1135	authors such a bill. You have the leader the republican party in the Senate here you've got some other members who may be interested. So that's probably our next discussion.
6360	Allen	Benjamin	70	oTonvRu6EKM	1258	1277	I was just wondering if I could ask a question that maybe she, maybe some of the panelists can answer, and she might want to answer this as well. It just has to do with, you know, the fact that several of the cities in my district, and I know some of us are in similar situations, you know, triple in size every day, during the day, because they're major job centers.
6361	Alejo	Luis	9	bcyIxM2tSYs	1157	1166	But certainly, I think having persons with any disabilities being able to get a ballot a month in advance, and be able to vote in the comfort of their own home.
6362	Wood	Jim	72	ASNmI2rHU9I	1669	1683	And, like I said, there are no angels. There are no devils. But, there are winners and there are losers. And, I wish that we could get everybody in a room and have these conversations, rather than duking it out through a bill. Thank you.
6363	Thurmond	Tony	4	QvpErJVY-kU	807	830	we suggested that we all start a campaign where we say we all know someone because we want to lift up stigma. Because we want to open people's minds to understanding that we all know someone, whether we know it or not, directly or indirectly.
6364	Nielsen	Jim	68	07ilphfHuEw	737	754	But I will make note of another point that I made in Committee today. And this related to the overall picture of dealing with our state employees and the MOU's, the accrual of annual leave and the caps.
6365	Chavez	Rocky	83	ZcJSZ4qEe4Y	728	746	I talked to my superintendents in my district about this, and asked them if they want us to go forward with it. And one of their concerns was, though they recognize the important need of it, they also recognize the challenges they're having right now with Common Core and local control funding. You know, facility grants, and everything else going on.
6366	Anderson	Joel	57	_4l4q_6Hap0	1720	1735	And I do think that, whether they choose to use their power to vote on not. The fact that we will get them into the courtrooms, participating in their civil duty, I think that is a good thing. People need to be invested in their country.
6367	Eggman	Susan Talamantes	73	VL9wjf3H8Kg	50	70	That is changing and, we this bill serves to be ready when the economy comes back fully and we're ready to find a new CSU that we have the actual data of where the greatest needs are in order to be able to use our money most effectively.
6368	De Leon	Kevin	102	1VsIgdliTQw	903	921	Thank you very much, Madame President and colleagues. We're going to warf Senate Resolution 51. We're going to make a modification on the Rules Committee. We are very honored and proud to announce that the Vice Chair, the new Vice Chair of the Senate Rules Committee will be in fact Senator Runner. Welcome Senator Runner to the Rules Committee and with that, I respectfully ask for an aye vote.
6369	Stone	Jeff	26	N91f_wLf7XI	824	862	And then lastly, one of the speakers before was talking about the investment, and people that are in the welfare-to-work program, and the disproportionate amount of partially increase in homelessness among those populations. Maybe there's a nexus, maybe you can tell me is there a nexus to the abolition of redevelopment which, as you know, twenty percent was set aside so that we could build low to moderate income housing - what impact has that had on that increase in homelessness?
6370	Galgiani	Cathleen	95	gAWN8j6c6Vc	423	448	So there are a lot of people locally that have battled with this for so long that that communication between the locals and the state will actually be very helpful. And that's the goal that we're hoping to achieve also. We have people who are past ag commissioners who are still in the community who are very, very familiar with things that have gone wrong in the past.
6371	Alejo	Luis	9	CD2KiD3xDgY	902	910	Community college was like the only choice that many of us had. But it's probably the most transformative experience in our lives. That's where I got serious about school, and my GPA went up.
6372	Leno	Mark	60	EP8eVPLyUZg	183	202	He himself used the word toxic or dangerous flame retardants 11 times in a single page, double spaced, press release. He was very definitive about it and communicated clearly to the public why he was bringing TB 117 into the 21st Century.
6373	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	72agwOjIAlc	1204	1221	But I think to Mr. Lackey's concern to make sure that it doesn't impede or interfere with standard practice, I'm hoping that this accentuates what is already practiced by local law enforcement and make them better at what they do.
6374	Maienschein	Brian	84	UqQcd0TyhPE	1022	1031	And to be able to nail it down, to be able to go to the local city council member or mayor or whoever it is and say, here's your options are in this case having that clarification, I do think is very significant.
6375	Chau	Ed	116	kAZMIWno7zI	1658	1675	Encryption I think Mr. Chair, you mentioned about encryption earlier and that's one of the other ways that we could try to basically protect the data. Once data enters into that information superhighway we could actually put some measures to protect this data.
6376	Mitchell	Holly	64	d16C5zYyC-4	1635	1650	So it's two sided. So the community colleges also have to recognize that you are providing a critical training opportunity for the CalWORKS population and if they can't access a classroom or if a term is canceled,
6377	Maienschein	Brian	84	NYGfzZLGLck	131	142	Today, I have with me Alameda County District Attorney, Nancy O'Malley, to testify in support. Thank you for the opportunity to present AB 1051, and I respectfully request your aye vote.
6378	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	IKESHE_NOXc	1807	1843	Thank you, Mr President. Members on behalf of the Legislative Women's Caucus, I wanted to just point out a few of the great women who have led the way of both for the black community but, also for our society as a whole. Now, Ralph Waldo Emerson said, "Do not go where the path may lead, instead where there is no path and leave a trail." Again, as Chair of the Legislative Women's Caucus I want to notice the trails African-American women have created for others to follow in their footsteps.
6379	McCarty	Kevin	22	I210RzVAPYs	1912	1925	Thank you for your leadership, i making that a priority this year in the budget. But as far as just collectively organizing, you know, people think about unions all the time, and wages, that's a good thing, I think, to get living wages.
6380	Hall	Isadore	1	IKESHE_NOXc	1768	1801	The valley of everyone who contributed to Black American History is very deep and wide in America. The California Legislative Black Caucus has highlighted some of these icons here in the capital their pictures and bios are currently reflected in the rotunda displayed between the Senate and Assembly chambers. And I encourage all Californians to use this month to celebrate the many contributions African-Americans have made to our state into our nation as a whole. I respectfully ask for your aye-vote on SR 11.
6381	Leyva	Connie	62	ZPVP4bYij2U	101	118	It goes without saying that exposure to lead and other contaminants is a major health concern particularly for young children as they are more susceptible to lead than adults. Children can develop anemia, stomach and intestinal problems, hearing impairment, even liver or kidney damage.
6382	McGuire	Mike	93	gqFKPQ41Jk4	1397	1416	So, we had one of the largest forest fires in the last several years up on the north coast. 911 service was out. And by the way state wasn't aware because there's no mandatory reporting. And when folks try to call out, they couldn't get through.
6383	Hancock	Loni	98	nfRac3nHOas	843	855	And I think you raise a very interesting issue which we might want to look at in the larger context of the Public Safety Committee, which is pre-trial bail schedules, etc.
6384	Monning	Bill	25	23IlHVpz85o	1483	1499	While I understand that this is a candidate for suspense, I'd like to note that the costs identified in the analysis are non-general fund, and both the motor vehicle account and private post-secondary education administration fund are supported by the programmatic fees.
6385	Wolk	Lois	94	4eIdwcDuXeo	1498	1512	In the LAO's, effectively implementing the 2014 water bond, there's a section here that deals with enhanced stream flows, which you are a strong advocate for, and what's controversial certainly.
6386	De Leon	Kevin	102	8GUUuCOIXCY	202	218	Exacerbated. And those are whoever proposes those types of measures, very well-intentioned, understanding the crisis and position in the State of California and the United States, to make sure that we are competitive with the rest of the world. Japan, South Korea, China and elsewhere.
6387	Monning	Bill	25	9CiJIuh6qrU	1194	1210	Using a, help me understand if you're calculating a median rate based on a state-wide does that adjust at all for regional cost-of-living or higher, higher costs by region in the State of California?
6388	Eggman	Susan Talamantes	73	REI9w9xwFAI	1412	1431	I have taught multiple masters level clinical classes on end of life. I have published somewhat extensively until I came into Legislature on this topic. I don't come at this kind of with a care-free attitude about this topic. Everybody who got up to oppose this bill, they don't have to use this bill.
6389	Hertzberg	Robert	99	3ZbkIQK-LEk	129	152	Right. [laughter] So as we all know throughout California, certain areas more concentrated than others, we have a series of offshore oil rigs that pump oil. Some are on the shelf that's a part of the state jurisdiction to the lands commission. Some go into federal jurisdiction. Of course if it's in international waters or in federal jurisdiction, the federal law additionally applies.
6390	Quirk	Bill	23	tEhMYBdIqkE	411	438	All right, so we're particularly concerned about addressing first of all the definition of what is trafficking and then the scope of the problem. And also discussing, particularly, although sex trafficking gets the headlines, labor trafficking is also a big issue. I don't know how they compare and, frankly, when you're talking about something that's illegal,
6391	Mullin	Kevin	31	23L8yaBtAnI	1968	1979	Monday June 8th. Floor session at noon. All other items remaining will be passed and retained. All motions shall be continued. Seeing and hearing no business, I'm ready to entertain a motion to adjourn.

Moving on to assembly third reading, file item 47. Mr. Secretary, please read.
6393	Mathis	Devon	75	U0AuDbfVwBc	1430	1450	And your solution is to hire more staff. Now throwing more staff at a problem isn't going to increase the timeliness of it getting done. If there is not a specific time frame laid into place, there is no goal and throwing more people at it.
6394	Hancock	Loni	98	GC6hApRO4Yg	297	320	Well the program is in Prop 69, and I'm not sure what it's budgeted, but the voters of California voted it in, it was the law of the land. It has been thrown out in a certain part, the DNA part of it, by the California appellate court. It is going to be heard by the state Supreme Court.
6395	Thurmond	Tony	4	kWtMirkLI5M	993	1008	Is there a second for the motion? Seeing no second, onto the original motion to adopt the May revision language with additions and staff comments as provisional placeholder trailer bill language, also to adopt the CPP. Is there a motion?
6396	Lara	Ricardo	107	XQwWN6GsS_M	73	95	Five states have these similar offices that are working towards creating a long term strategy of how we integrate and implement policies for our new Americans and immigrant integration. The last office that was created was through a Republican governor in Michigan.

6398	Moorlach	John	4657	xvcU4IJP8VQ	938	964	Is that the old Chinese proverb? The best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago. And we're, we're mandating that homeowner's associations set up reserves in anticipation of repaving roads, re-roofing all, you know, all kinds of projects. I'm just wondering if that could be included in your legislation, that, that we are getting better at our fiscal stewardship with the items that we build and maintain.
6399	Gaines	Ted	24	RdbGbgsSaLY	1511	1523	Thank you. Any other witnesses in support? Any witnesses in opposition? Any questions of the committee? Do we -- would you like to make a closing statement or -- is there a question? Excuse me, okay.
6400	Allen	Benjamin	70	ZM99l_dNJfs	840	856	OK, all right, let me ask you as, you know, we talked about the money associated with outreach resources. You know, if the state was able to help counties in that voter outreach, how would you want that money to be spent, and how would you advise us to think about new monies in this area?
6401	Moorlach	John	4657	VHKwUGu3F0g	210	232	Assembly Woman Olsen, I am having some difficulty with this. The first is that we've got so many tax credit proposals, and I'm having difficulty with that as a CPA. I just wonder how we all, after all these go through, what happens to our model, our tax gathering model.
6402	Garcia	Eduardo	38	ejG5Ru6MX_o	1629	1649	There isn't anyone overseeing the effort, but at the same time looking at best practices and trying to maximize the opportunities. We have people, perhaps, that don't believe that the direction that we're moving in is the right one. I think that, again, you and I know in Imperial County that there is a tremendous amount of opportunity.
6403	Hernandez	Roger	37	ZHlQISHQoPg	751	763	As a matter of fact, during the Great Recession, I think what we saw was just nothing, no inflation. I think that, that was a year of zero, if something, very de minimus below-
6404	Brown	Cheryl	13	SfuHS4UPco0	720	752	Thank you. First of all it's a wonderful panel and it's really great to come and to hear what happens to what we put forth a couple years ago. So it's great to be here. I wanted to ask you, Tia you, Miss Boatman, you said that there were 12,200 units built, and only 566 went to vets. Was that you, or was that you? I'm sorry.
6405	Hancock	Loni	98	omDEH7LCBKo	405	420	I think that, actually in addition to looking at the credentials, and i don't know if CDCR, do you have a list of the prohibited professions? I wonder where we'd find it.I'd be interested. I've never seen a complete list.
6406	Gordon	Richard	117	ZurQFkaNhto	105	123	In summary, AB 379 would require an annual notice of the educational rights available to foster youth, give foster youth access to the uniform complaint procedure, provide foster youth with compensatory educational services if it was found that there were violations of their rights.

6410	Brown	Cheryl	13	IZt1azLwLX4	992	1017	That's what I wanted to hear because when I saw them on television, when I saw some of the students on television crying that they have poured their lives into this, into improving their lives, how do we go back and maybe even use some of those classes so that they can do something with the classes that they've already enrolled in and passed?
6411	Pan	Richard	96	DJsU22tiuNg	1047	1064	They've negotiated, they've worked out. Okay? Now what happens is you have a situation where you have a physician who probably has rejected or there has been no negotiation between the physician and the plan, right? And now they've provided the service to the patient and I agree we want to keep the patients out.
6412	Leyva	Connie	62	6RcHSaSd1rw	60	82	Thank you madame President. Good morning members. SB334 is back from concurrence with Assembly amendments, which removed the lead testing and contamination mitigation provisions. As amended, the bill prohibits schools from providing drinking water that does not meet the US EPA drinking water standards for lead or other contaminants
6413	Leno	Mark	60	aItBzVMycEU	841	872	This bill is not a job killer, it is a major job creator. In fact, the world's largest solar array is currently under construction in the antelope valley in Kern county. The world is following California's lead as we create more jobs at a faster pace toward a cleaner and more sustainable economy. The sun does rise in the west. I ask for your aye vote.
6414	Mullin	Kevin	31	mOqF8MknDiY	1320	1327	Thank you, Mr. Chair. Very brief, briefly just want to thank Madam Speaker for your leadership on this issue hailing from San Mateo county in a high cost area.
6415	Wood	Jim	72	yGdC7D9fPQ8	967	980	The watersheds that we depend upon for our own safety and our own drinking water are also the homes, in particular the Sprout Creek in southern Humboldt County, to five endangered salmon species.
6416	Hancock	Loni	98	12bt77nSPXs	575	609	Okay, thank you. LAO, do you ave any comments? Department of Finance, any comments? Are there any questions from members of the subcommittee? Okay I would entertain a motion to approve as budgeted. Oh, are there public, did I ask for public comment? Then moved. Please read the roll.
6417	Block	Marty	59	Ms6-wag6WJY	705	722	SB 369 has enjoyed unanimous bipartisan support thus far, and its supporters include The California PTA, The US Department of Defense, The United States Navy, The United States Marine Corps, numerous veteran's organizations and others. It has no opposition.
6418	Block	Marty	59	CyJMVxFxLck	1295	1309	 More like I don't know. Okay, show that passing 2 to 1. And with that, I don't think there's any business left for this committee today. I wanna thank the members for their long service today.
6419	Nielsen	Jim	68	TKHmWCrbj-o	1184	1205	Mr. Chairman, this kind of gets into policy, but it's appropriate. It just amazes me every year, how certain organizations attack charter schools. Trying to make them the standards of mediocrity that public education now has given our children for decades. Charter schools are working.
6420	Moorlach	John	4657	uz1blTsZnws	1618	1630	Mr. Chair, just maybe just to wrap up, cuz I'm trying to get my hands around this. What's the efficacy? Is it worthwhile or are we just, help me out.
6421	Allen	Travis	43	R3SMzNAvRKs	1739	1752	All of our public schools exist for one reason and that's to protect our children and educate them, so they can be better Californians, so they can be better people, so they can achieve their own American dream.

The Department of Industrial Relations is required to submit a report to the legislature in 2018. Since the enactment of AB 1565, state bond funds for new construction and modernization projects have been exhausted.
6423	Irwin	Jacqui	16	IBKt_ere1yc	459	486	The federal Department of Defense has conducted four BRAC rounds since 1988, the most recent in 2005 which resulted in the closure of 25 major bases in California. Another BRAC round has been proposed for 2017.
6424	Mullin	Kevin	31	oyj26fO_o0A	78	104	With more than three decades of evidence from randomized controlled trials, evidence based home visiting programs have demonstrated sustained improvements in maternal health, child health, positive parenting practices, child development and school readiness, reductions in child maltreatment, family economic self sufficiency, linkages and referrals, and reductions, as well, in family violence.
6425	Wagner	Donald	88	XAJHKAVYVrw	610	628	Thank you. Let me start by saying I'm extremely sympathetic to where you're trying to go with the Bill. In part, I've got a daughter, thankfully, out of law school without any debt, but who is in a District Attorney's office, and I know from whence you speak.
6426	Steinorth	Marc	35	g595lZYQYE0	1668	1680	And the requirements to actually modify those CCNR's are quite onerous, where you need to have not only 75% of the homeowners approve but sometimes the people that actually own the debt on the home so it can be quite challenging.
6427	Stone	Mark	20	4Kyw8qlYrTk	278	297	And Mr. Tom Clark, who is principal council for the Judiciary Committee, did I think an excellent job of laying out, framing the history and the details of the court decision and the issue that's before us here today. So that is the framework from which we've launched into the hearing that we have.
6428	Bonilla	Susan	3	99NWh04_JOI	240	255	I hope we can get there by the end of this session, if not, we do need this in place or we actually put at risk a number of these businesses and a lot of optometrists who actually work in these businesses. And of course, we have optometrists on the other side of the issue as well.
6429	Hertzberg	Robert	99	gRicLj3q_0M	973	1003	What I wanna know is, with respect to this, this all sounds great, you've got your numbers and all that stuff, and we can report as a government. At the end of the day I wanna put people to work, and putting people to work means you finance projects to make it work. What I wanna know is what homework have you done with respect to the finance community to marry this concept with actually getting the capital to build out the energy efficiency, cuz this is the missing link. Any thoughts, Doctor, Professor or the- Sure. Mr. Chairman.
6430	Wieckowski	Bob	55	1-lHMg2FsZ4	824	856	But I don't know anybody that did it, but I know people that, that did it I don't think, I don't think there's, its the thousands of people that will come in and take advantage of it. I guess, you're we will get back to you, I mean I don't have the numbers of, of how many, all the different states, they don't have the numbers, the different people that have contacted the manufacturer to take direct sales, versus just having a outlet in their state, and they just purchase it there, right?
6431	Lara	Ricardo	107	pqf8UezhQwo	2006	2027	I want to support this, 'cause to give you a vehicle to have a broader discussion, but, as somebody, we share our districts, and one of the most heavily impacted communities as the inland empire, when we do get some wind in L.A., all the pollution goes straight into the 909.
6432	Pavley	Fran	104	pqf8UezhQwo	889	902	And maybe a real focus on more regional solutions as well. So, we're trying to get the metrics right, but I'm glad those people are in the room because putting the Water Board and the Energy Commission together, really good idea.
6433	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	7bdBeI04iMY	1222	1231	ensure that the status collection that we can refer to something so we can actually address the problem that we know exists I respectfully ask for an aye vote.
6434	Calderon	Ian Charles	115	n57XOOZPs8w	872	883	And what can come from that is a great solution as to what we can expect in finding solutions for affordable long-term care and I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
6435	Mendoza	Tony	52	ewcXToh_gOY	292	306	Just as the, authorization to sell fireworks for this week of fourth of July, the second week of sales remains under local control, and must have a local, local resolution passed by a local government to adopt the second week.
6436	McGuire	Mike	93	a71Txrj65NA	1738	1763	So, I would hope that gonna be able to work together as regional governments to be able to advance this. It has worked by the way, we're not reinventing the wheel. We are looking at 600 other local jurisdictions across this union that have developed successful systems.
6437	Dodd	Bill	71	9fvwP7KwrvY	1718	1741	Right. Is put in place. And I kind of even wanna ask the question as we've evolved today in medical practices. Why the corporate bar for a hospital for example. We heard testimony today that is a real small number. That we're really arguing about anyway.
6438	Berryhill	Tom	54	Gcdptg51L2I	100	125	You've done it as a gentleman and I think the fact that just this last Wednesday at your birthday the fact that the Governor, our own pro term, the speaker and numerous people showed up to thank you for your leadership is a true testament to your bipartisan nature and the leadership that you've brought to this institution.
6439	Wolk	Lois	94	u9WQRBoV7yg	1143	1159	We're being visited by high school students first in the back of the chamber from Davis high school. We have Sydney Short and Francis Nguyen. Welcome to our chamber.
6440	Wieckowski	Bob	55	ogaPmR_89iU	319	334	Well there's some, there's some states that don't allow the Tesla to be purchased by their, their members. So Texas is the big, is the big culprit here. So if you're a Texan and you want to buy a made in California Tesla, you can't do it.
6441	Mullin	Kevin	31	PZ5qNcZ4hzo	1115	1130	I thank the elections chair for his comments and ensuring accurate election outcomes should be a priority for the state of California, and by creating a state-funded option for these very close contests, AB 44 accomplishes that goal. I respectfully ask for an aye vote.
6442	Runner	Sharon	4656	Kg4hNcGh7pk	1203	1218	It's really a miracle to me that I'm back serving in the Legislature, the miracle of medicine, the doctors at UCLA sitting in the same seat I sat before I was sick and had the double lung transplant. I am so grateful to serve once again the Antelope Valley, where I live, where I've lived my entire life.
6443	Stone	Jeff	26	2afEpcU9CME	1269	1289	Thank you madam President and with all due respects to my colleague from Bell Gardens, I rise today to oppose SJR4, but it is with a heavy heart that I do so. Doctor Sally Ride is certainly a national hero being the first American astronaut is certainly an accomplishment that should be recognized and applauded.
6444	Gipson	Mike	28	aX3hcacca8I	565	588	Sure, I absolutely want to add to it. I would beg to differ that there is a statute of limitation. When someone kills someone in a cross walk or on the streets, we hit the pause button until the individual is identified. And then, once the individual is identified, then the pause button's released and you have one year to bring charges and prosecute that individual.
6445	Hernandez	Ed	103	o_iCJQqprWQ	1423	1442	And I think it's important but I'm only just cautioning my concern especially on the provider side with what's in place for the providers for other additional things that they have to do besides the collection of this particular data. I'll give you an example from ICD 9 to ICD 10 I mean it's gonna be horrible.
6446	Pavley	Fran	104	b4USpkALPiM	501	524	Today we have a national policy. Mr. Dolly was talking about it. It married the California standards on clean cars by the first tail pipe emission bill in the country's history to fuel efficiency standards that only the department of transportation can do. By 2026 we'll have an average of 54 mile per gallon vehicles.
6447	Beall	Jim	92	898OiW72jWg	645	693	In terms of the zero base budget concept, and the program that Caltrans does for budgeting, I think the Senator had numbers that he was giving that were developed, I guess, from an outside organization or inside and outside, Senator? Various sources, so does the budgeting process provide the Legislature with the cost of delivering projects in terms of private sector engineering versus internal engineering staff in terms of delivery of construction projects.
6448	De Leon	Kevin	102	fspIOvsCcqM	1238	1251	Mr. Rogers, you have passed this committee, the Rules Committee on the five to zero vote. Your nomination will go for a full Senate floor vote in the near future. Congratulations.
6449	Hill	Jerry	66	m4t87KOfLMk	1112	1141	But had there been a representative on the board to share that and be a conscience to all of us during those experiences, during those hearings, it would have made my job much easier and it would have brought the perspective and the frame of reference that would be so necessary for that board to act responsibly for the whole state. And so I think this is an outstanding effort and will create a real opportunity for the community to have that representation and to have a voice and a stronger voice.
6450	Frazier	Jim	114	dKlfu24NXRk	1578	1596	Any members of the public that would like to testify in opposition of the bill? Please state your name, who you represent and the opposition. Thank you, ma'am. Two minutes.
6451	Hueso	Ben	48	Tb_ZR86SMpk	724	736	As promised in Committee we have worked very hard with the opposition to get their support in the bill, to work out little details and the bill that needed to be improved in order to make this bill more practicable.
6452	Huff	Bob	105	VyoFcVtTJtQ	73	84	I would stipulate also that I grew up in ag community and those that were involved in rodeo and similar kinds of activities, they did create those lifestyles. I followed them over the years.
6453	Roth	Richard	106	owIYV6IXgFg	1179	1198	So, if you have a particular skilled nursing facility with high acuity patient load, you would necessarily, whether this bill passes or not, maybe need to staff up with more registered nurses and LVN's to care properly for the patients in your facility.
6454	Gipson	Mike	28	r0_c68VZXFY	651	666	This resolution seeked to, one, to celebrate the 50th anniversary, but also talks about 34 individuals who were innocent, who were not part of any civil unrest, 34 individuals who lost their lives, innocent bystanders.
6455	Mullin	Kevin	31	ch3qK2_FbyA	1065	1087	Thank you, Madam Speaker, with that the clerk will open the roll. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. The clerk will close the roll. Tally the votes, ayes 49, noes 24. Measure passes. Members, we're going to move to file item 57, that's AB 1335.
6456	Thurmond	Tony	4	58ODc-fO4Eo	1475	1484	But we do have an opportunity to take a step here now and I'm gonna be asking the committee for a motion and to take action on the Governor's May revision EITC proposal.
6457	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	BISvC49mosc	1658	1674	If the Chamber doesn't want it, if Business doesn't want it, then I guess we won't get two Republicans to vote for it, right? Or maybe we will. I'm just trying to move something forward that satisfies the entirety of the business community in the same way that we said we would. We are not rewriting the rules.
6458	Rendon	Anthony	120	87MaMZIVBPA	142	161	 That bill has 12 votes, that bill is out. Next up is AB886, which is Mr. Chow. Oh, we're gonna lift the call on that, correct? We'll lift the call on AB 886 for Mr. Chow.
6459	De Leon	Kevin	102	nVE2-FVOyaQ	337	361	I would say the consultant Committee recommendations with regards the pilot programs, as I think you know, are not viewed favorably by certain members of the Legislature. I think primarily Senator Mark Leno chair of the Budget Committee, who has a measure with regards to ex parte communications for the commissioners of the PUC.
6460	Nazarian	Adrin	36	D-fVk6CkUDE	766	777	A FEMA study shows that money spent on hazard mitigation is a sound investment. On average, every dollar spent on mitigation provides our communities with $4 in future benefits.
6461	Leno	Mark	60	JB8xflm0bpc	1144	1174	I just want to clarify for all the very important reasons you've just expressed, Senator Desaulnier did not put before the legislature a piece that would shift us from our current way of taxing fuel to vehicle miles traveled. Instead, he said we need more information, we need to look into all the different questions you've just asked and they are rightful questions and that's the purpose of the program before us.
6462	Burke	Autumn	6	bgIZ8epTm-I	1248	1268	I'm really quick. I just wanted to thank assembly member Bloom, for the provision for disadvantaged communities, because so often disadvantages communities don't get to participate in energy efficiency opportunities because they are financially out of reach for them. So I just really want to thank you as someone who represents a disadvantaged community for including us in this opportunity.
6463	Brough	William	111	gdqTdEZLl0I	605	618	This is not about standalone ERs. It's about keeping ER services available at this site. AB 911 would allow lifesaving services to continue at Memorial Care's proposed new San Clemente facility.
6464	Bates	Pat	58	1JV-wI6cFUY	1376	1393	The City of Laguna Beach had a very difficult problem. They actually created a homeless center where you can go for overnight shelter. The county then directed all of our resources to that encampment so that they would receive the resources and had law enforcement there.
6465	Wolk	Lois	94	_JbASqkciSI	1453	1490	Six and seven have to do with a... including on the panel, people that have relevant scientific expertise, but also have experience in applied science and project implementation, like resource conservation districts, like cooperative extension. We need to have a stakeholder meeting to talk about this. We haven't been able to convene that meeting yet. It will happen before this goes any further or the bill will not move further. We will have that conversation.
6466	Levine	Marc	8	N_ZNvKt6lzQ	1882	1894	Yeah, well thank you very much, Mr. Chair, and I did want to make a comment about the amendments that I had to alluded to that will accurately reflect me as the lead author on this legislation. I respectfully request an aye vote.
6467	Weber	Shirley	44	FR5oPTw2QLM	114	130	I do have ongoing concerns of us constantly funding something temporarily, supposedly. We'll have a solution to the problem. And that's one of the challenges we thought we had help last year to prevent the closure, and it didn't and it's still closed.
6468	Mullin	Kevin	31	AAng3WP84Ks	205	228	A quorum is present. We ask our guests and visitors in the rear of the chamber and in the gallery to please stand for the prayer. Members, today's prayer will be offered by our Assembly Chaplain, Father Constantine Pappademos. Father Pappademos.
6469	Frazier	Jim	114	kJUQLNRw8o8	1377	1387	And thank you. I respectfully ask for your support when the suspense file's taken on behalf of the 5,500 parents statewide who have voiced their strong support for this bill and I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
6470	Chang	Ling Ling	18	VL9wjf3H8Kg	1354	1363	Qualified students will have to carry the recommendation of the principle of their enrolled high school and parental consent. They must have exhausted all opportunities to take an equivalent course or program offered by the local school district.
6471	Stone	Jeff	26	c8SqTr4brJk	1752	1767	They cannot pay their public safety bills. I've got the city of San Jacinto that Mr. Morrell is the Senator for. I'm right next door in Hemet, that is operating at a deficit. They cannot pay their public safety bill.
6472	Wieckowski	Bob	55	1kHDjtxLuww	2144	2163	I know several years ago, there was a legislative effort to modify how we calculate the measurements for thinning the forests. And there was a deal that was made, I think it's 18 inches.
6473	Stone	Mark	20	rb93slzi3ec	1629	1663	And if you look on page 4, line 32, which is f sub c, if a new petition has been filed against a minor for felony offense by the probation department for limited purpose of, or that they may be, what the reference is is that it may be-- Opened by the probation department forthe limited purpose of identifying the minor's previous court-ordered programs or placements in the event solely to determine the individual's eligibility or suitability for remedial programs or services.
6474	Leno	Mark	60	_7J2e3A3mdU	199	215	Thank you Madam Chair. Assemblyman, when this was first established, not surprisingly we had some concerns about potential loss of privacy, I know that there was some strict constraints to make sure that it is being used for one purpose, one purpose only.
6475	Baker	Catharine	74	XrOqCob7jCo	1005	1021	Thank you. It certainly sounds like the possibility for inconsistencies might be one that hopefully you're open to, considering it sounds like valid points have been raised. Well thank you again, we'll be voting yes today.
6476	Liu	Carol	63	Htnfsa9QnRM	603	619	Okay, any others in support of the bill? Is there opposition to the bill? Seeing none. Other questions from members? The bill has been moved. Would you like to close Assemblymember Cooper.
6477	Block	Marty	59	RJGZrXESD6M	280	304	You see, as we all know, when we serve on jury duty, we are away from our business. Now if you work for the government or you work for a very large corporation, that may not have an impact, but for our small business people, who we care so much about in California, having people on jury duty where they're just sitting and waiting because of the relatively huge numbers of pre-emptory challenges in California, is terribly inefficient for California's economy.
6478	Mullin	Kevin	31	LXP_ciN3hzY	747	762	Thank you, Ms. Kim. Without objection, we may take a voice vote on this item. All those in favor say aye. Oppose say nay. The ayes have it. Senate amendments are concurred in. Moving to Assembly third reading. File item number two, ACR13.
6479	Hill	Jerry	66	4RPfdYzqQQc	353	370	SB 469 also clarifies that the Commission can conduct drug testing at any time during a fighter's period of licensure and authorizes the Commission to assess a fine equal to 40% of the total PERS for use of a prohibited substance. I ask for your aye vote, members.
6480	Wieckowski	Bob	55	H8qQQkSchzo	153	164	This is a result of not one, but two re accounting or state audit reports that said do something legislatures we want you the legislators to come up with something.
6481	Lara	Ricardo	107	qbKF38sndDw	378	412	6 to 1, that item is out or he could say, ay, no! Assembly Member Dahle, moving on to AB 429, Public Contracts Preferences, do pass as amended per author to allow CDF to expand. The purchase preference and to delete reference to the carbon offset protocols. Substitute the roll on AB 361, that bill is approved on unanimous vote of 7 to 0.
6482	Weber	Shirley	44	SdYdT8y72Ng	784	791	And it's obviously one that's gonna, we're gonna see constantly coming up in the budget as we see then needs not being met we think effectively at the local level.
6483	Weber	Shirley	44	toyLEHK5bMU	90	109	repay the federal government for community development block grant funds. Three, these provisions would result in hundreds of millions of dollars going back to local agencies and four, it keeps the provisions in the governor's proposal that we'd like for the ERAF payments. This bill, as most bills, is not perfect. Not
6484	Wood	Jim	72	8sqAOKYjfF4	1182	1196	In theory, I guess I could accept that, but as you heard, we're going based on already established guidelines, so I'm not really sure how that would ultimately affect this bill going forward. Happy to look into that.
6485	Nazarian	Adrin	36	yXONMtuCfN8	545	561	Yes. I can't speak to the language right now because--obviously we can't--hear that language right now, but I'm happy to work with you on that to make sure that that's addressed. Is anything else you'd like to add to that?
6486	Wieckowski	Bob	55	QJc2lBXiJmk	385	406	However what assurances do I and my colleagues in the Legislature have that DOGGR will not continue to ignore state and federal law and regulations? DOGGR has serious credibility and performance problems. I will be listening today for its plans and pledge to continue oversight efforts."
6487	Patterson	Jim	119	yXONMtuCfN8	561	630	Following up, and you've, it will become a recurring theme with me here, so with due respect to my colleagues. I do want to at least explore this whole area of what I think is an assault especially on  due process. You suggest that there is some kind of merit in cutting a process that is administrative and has limitations, if you will, if there is an adjudication by the local entity, for example, or by the labor to seek a redress by the party who has been determined to be "guilty", this bad actor to have their day in court, to be able to access the full range of due process, opportunities that are fundamental to the to the constitution.
6488	Bonilla	Susan	3	goLRzsDXvfE	672	691	When you're a new teacher you're required in the State of California to go through a two-year program to get your clear credential and that program is really one of mentoring. It's one of someone coming in and observing you in the classroom and helping you with your lesson plans. It's very important to our high-quality and well qualified teacher program.
6489	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	emhy9UKtKg0	516	530	and I personally wanna thank him for, and all of us who have been working to try and get something, because I think we all really would like to see something happen here, something positive. So, with that, does that concur with your understanding, sir?
6490	Lara	Ricardo	107	q3wgHNrBLP0	61	110	And Who are we missing, Senator... Oh and if we can call Senator Mitchell, please. Senator Mitchell and Hernandez, Anderson, and we have Senator Hill here. Perfect, we're gonna continue as, oh, as a subcommittee before we adopt the rules. And we'll have Senator Hill, since you're here on time, please proceed Senator Hill.
6491	Hill	Jerry	66	kj6ztr1oPBg	1013	1029	A 5% exemption would help relatively few if any California companies. But a 10% exemption would help companies like Bulldog Lighting. In my district, and could, I believe, help Maglite flashlights and help Lifetime, products, which makes basketball hoops.
6492	Leno	Mark	60	u1CD9eH0kHI	1659	1679	But, if we're talking in single digit dollars per month, and the alternative is we have to find $1.1 billion somewhere in our budget to cut to make up for it, it puts it in more real terms for us to be able to understand ourselves and to describe to our constituents.
6493	Lackey	Tom	10	oGlT-6EtEZU	159	171	Much to the detriment of the UTS over the past decade, LA County Public Works Department has been working in conjunction with state and federal agencies on the habitat restoration project.
6494	Leno	Mark	60	_ES7C4KFvkc	1040	1051	And could there be wisdom in using some of the remaining funds not necessarily up to 100 million but for training and technology needs in some of these areas.
6495	Wieckowski	Bob	55	E7fL6Rs-58o	1951	1969	Now, currently one of the things that happens is the disposal facility, it gives the information to the county, the county then sends it to CalRecycle. One the things the bill does is fixes this and makes it go directly from the facility to CalRecycle; it does a bunch of other things also. I urge an aye vote.
6496	Hill	Jerry	66	9Ksuo-8qRMo	163	183	This just reduces the consequences of antibiotic resistance, a growing public health threat.  I think all of you are aware of this.  I had some similar legislation last year that applied to California's hospitals, this now applies to those who were infected in healthcare facilities and scaled nursing facilities, and I would ask for your aye vote, members, thank you.
6497	Block	Marty	59	dsDmjvJ4L6g	1118	1137	Yeah, see that is something I'd really like to see. I mean, you clearly have the data, and the idea of how you would process it to come to a number of total needed, then we look at the number of total available, and it's that gap that I'm really interested in seeing, so thank you for that.
6498	Gatto	Mike	46	QOFO_OlHLpI	44	56	But, on the two year bill front, I think we have some type of idea of where things could go and if we get those in by next week are we pushing up against the deadlines? It's my understanding that we still could.
6499	Obernolte	Jay	86	0LdXFnPqPCk	1564	1583	According to a Brookings Institute survey, over 20% of current careers in the United States require specialized preparation and education in stem related fields. The U.S. Department of Commerce says that over the next decade job growth in stem related fields will be over three times the job growth in unrelated fields.
6500	Stone	Jeff	26	5o713VccuaM	959	973	So if you had a case where somebody was going in for a colonic and an inappropriate act occurred in preparation of the colonic that ended up in some type of sodomy,
6501	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	N6EhWxD1_nY	582	592	With technology, using a website, and maybe working with the industry and others to make it very clear, maybe even on the website, what things could be harmful to you.
6502	Weber	Shirley	44	d_EaaILk1VE	1084	1098	Well, they're brought back, those that are taken off suspense are brought back for vote but those that remain on suspense are never brought back if my memory serves cause I've had several on suspense that have been there for -- I don't know where they are now but --
6503	Wolk	Lois	94	ZKJUzc_ClWA	1	25	Senator, what I'm struggling with is whether or not we should, why we should, interfere right now with the rule-making. Which is going to end, is supposed to end, by the fall of this year. And they're in the middle of it.
6504	Pavley	Fran	104	aMmnutMx8lk	1806	1831	That become very distracting for DWR to implement this for doing 3030 plans. The Groundwater Sustainability Management Plan actually has very specific language, no new AB 3030 plans may be developed or may existing plans be amended, and that's so that DWR could focus at getting the job done.
6505	Gomez	Jimmy	80	QXW5aikdMmE	192	205	Requiring annual review of the injection project's budget July 2016 and every year after. Phase and monitoring requirements and specify the plan is for the life of the project subject to the State Water Board review. A roll call.
6506	Daly	Tom	118	1fxZCVj9XoA	1220	1233	As a consequence, some individuals who have clearly cross the line and committed sexual assaults can only be charged with less serious crimes. AB 860 adds provisions that will correct this flaw in the code.
6507	Lara	Ricardo	107	vUWGQO4sF_w	717	730	And, you know, eliminating the aquatic program. Which is one of the programs that, for those folks that have limited mobility, give them that opportunity to feel that they can accomplish something when they're in the water. And be able to swim.
6508	Hancock	Loni	98	Q9LdqK3BIlI	895	930	We've been discussing whether that precludes closing a yard in an individual prison or whether you have to close an entire facility. But the blueprint did promise billions of dollars in savings which haven't materialized. So do you anticipate that the report that we'll be getting will really discuss population projections and a general status of our facilities?
6509	Nguyen	Janet	65	BifOW5Vhe4Q	939	955	Yeah, and I, Mr. Chairman and colleagues, I really appreciate allowing me to bring this up. Given that there's quite some lively discussions on, we do want some more data, maybe, I'm gonna at this time then just make it a two year bill.
6510	Stone	Jeff	26	DiYo45O70Kw	1437	1446	But if they sell at less than market values, there's going to be a caveat with the contract with the developer that you're only going to have certain levels of revenue you're gonna be getting from these units.
6511	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	tIl0bzr-tVs	1171	1182	It's much more complex when it is a felony filing rather than a misdemeanor filing. And I understand the bill is recommended for suspense, and I look forward to working with the committee to make the appropriate adjust,
6512	Leno	Mark	60	RLVvRo75HJI	1669	1704	All right. Very good. Yes. So then with those three votes taken, there is a page 42.1. If I can find it. And this is the LA River Opportunity Acquisition. Senator Lara?
6513	Monning	Bill	25	rrDz5IDQFPY	1779	1798	To facilitate an increase in skilled nursing facility, complaint investigation and quarterly visits, and there's some subsections there. Do I have a motion in support of this item? So we have a 2-0 vote on this item four. And we're gonna hold that open for the chair as well.
6514	Dababneh	Matthew	50	goLRzsDXvfE	1177	1203	I believe there's valuable opportunity here to once again push California to lead the way in digital innovation. This bill's goal is not to discontinue the use of traditional driver's license, but rather, I believe it's a first step which will our constituents in the near future to use their digital driver's license to prove identification while using their apple pay to buy a cup of coffee or a digital boarding pass to board an airplane at a local airport.
6515	Hadley	David	40	9mjyTPfbhPw	919	939	The point I was going to get to, which is ironic I was shut down on this point. The point that I was going to get to was, notwithstanding my procedural objections, we have an important bill before us. It's upon all of us to vote our conscience, and I thank all of you for this debate.
6516	Mitchell	Holly	64	m2ykh0Fimz0	1644	1659	No, I appreciate. I'll speak on behalf of Senator Stone. I appreciate you walking kind of how we got to where we are today and the roll you all played in your effort. You represent your membership. Thank you.
6517	Huff	Bob	105	VyoFcVtTJtQ	38	48	And I think that's-- rather than focusing on inputs, we should be focusing on what motivates people. What gets them engaged? What gets them to that level of activity that keeps us lean and not obese?
6518	Rendon	Anthony	120	yegxkcxS3po	587	608	For example, the debt ratio for bond commitments has been as low as 0.20, declining sales of imported water every year by as much as 9 percent in the last fiscal year legal. Legal expenses to the tune of 200,000 dollars in some months, individual months, 200,000 dollars.
6519	Hueso	Ben	48	Rj2lrXkjDIw	2522	2538	I'm also supporting it because, you know, as we move toward the 50% RPS, you know, that will create a good fit for this bill to be introduced into all parts of the state.
6520	De Leon	Kevin	102	fq3Zw3PUDj4	475	527	Okay the motion passes on a five-zero vote, congratulations to both of you.  Madam Secretary lets go back to follow item number one please call the roll.  Okay, file item number one passes on a five-zero vote reference of bills okay colleagues will go file item number three through ten, file item number three through ten. Files item number three through ten. If I can get a motion. We have a motion made by Ms. Fuller. Madam Secretary please call the roll.
6521	Hernandez	Ed	103	Ir2eiizDgdE	1682	1707	Not only will this bill ensure that youth avoid a lifetime of addiction, but it does so in the most economical way by treating e-cigarettes as tobacco products. Given that the tobacco companies have embraced e-cigarettes and control an increasing share of the market place, it really is critical that we treat e-cigarettes as what they are, traditional tobacco. Thank you.
6522	Chau	Ed	116	bgwj3wqmbCQ	1206	1220	Would imposing a flat fee, as opposed to, let's say, per-document fee, do you remember or do you know? Would the other states imposing a flat fee for let's say per-transaction or was it based on per-document fee?
6523	Bonilla	Susan	3	5EeaivfMcyY	25	42	We're just having a little shuffle of people in the audience. Thank you very much, Mr. Mendoza and this is item one in your agenda. Court Reporters Board of California. Thank you very much.
6524	Anderson	Joel	57	u0-ac-4sGAg	127	144	But you wouldn't be able to write off a Four Runner for the police chief to drive, or any other fire man. This keeps in the spirit of the current law, while ensuring that the tax dollars are used most efficiently to protect our communities.  With me today I have some witnesses.
6525	Lara	Ricardo	107	qbKF38sndDw	109	131	Six to one, that item is out. Next author is Assembly Member Chavez. Beginning with AB 413, do pass to the Senate Floor. Substitute the roll from AB 361 that bill's approved on a unanimous vote of seven to zero. Next author is Assembly Member Chu. AB 35, Tax Credits, Low Income Housing, do pass to the Senate Floor. Secretary, please call the roll.
6526	Baker	Catharine	74	hTPaXL_VY8w	1832	1843	Thank you. This is a Due Pass to Appropriations. Oh, that's right. We need a motion and a second. And we have those. Due pass. Please call the roll.
6527	Hertzberg	Robert	99	X4Bkp9BrIdE	2113	2133	with respect to your AB 169 Mr. Maienschein. And with respect to the clerks the point that was raised we agreed to take clerk's amendments to allow locals to decide who makes the catalog. The point is that this is a big idea measured against all of the stuff that we're focused on, the mechanics of government.
6528	Linder	Eric	39	5o713VccuaM	141	152	These volunteers are not only in Riverside; Los Angeles Police Department has a mounted officer group with 180 members, half of which are volunteers that use their own animals while on duty.
6529	Bloom	Richard	2	D85P8H59LjQ	937	951	There are no cities that fall under the current criteria that would be spending funds for projects that, somebody thought up because they knew that, our rate involvement was going to be ending.
6530	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	OVIQdDmHNzI	48	75	That is its very modest goal. This is not a Christmas tree for all the things that are good or bad about CEQA, this is what I would really call the lowest hanging fruit, which is based upon an outreach that we did to all the stakeholders last year which asked them what are the key things about CEQA that you would like to see changed.
6531	Wieckowski	Bob	55	6q5JSfST1YQ	1416	1427	This would eliminate the unequal burden placed on children and their families, these are the adults, to appear in court during school and work hours. It would also decrease the work load of our crowded court system.
6532	Melendez	Melissa	41	rKOC2CSv6h0	444	462	Thank you, Madam Chair. So, this bill is fine with the exception of the fact that it's extending the opportunity to not go through the bidding process. I dont know thats such a good idea. We already, what was it, 2014, the press covered the fact that there was
6533	Mitchell	Holly	64	MTWW-DN4Tdo	862	879	Moving on to the Department of Public Health, item 4265. Item number one, AIDS Drug Assistance Program, ADAP. The recommendation is to increase the Federal fund authority. That's out with a two, one vote.
6534	Burke	Autumn	6	qrJj2d7lUww	1158	1171	Well, what we're talking about is that we are looking at the amendments that you have given us, and that we will work with those in appropriations. But we thank your staff for your suggestions.
6535	Leno	Mark	60	BQgV9eqQ2Tw	445	462	But if you're a transgender employee in the city and county of San Francisco and you need the identical medical care the county health plan pays for none of it. Bill's response was "Supervisor, you make a compelling argument." So I would ask for your aye vote.
6536	Williams	Das	12	QUWe44dQD4o	727	746	So if you break down all uses of water in the state, it's going to be a small percentage. That doesn't we shouldn't all be conserving water through every means that we can. So do you have other ways that you could drill down, so to speak, in telling us how accomplish that recommendation?
6537	Mitchell	Holly	64	DwrMQLfFxcs	312	323	Thank you very much and I appreciate you being here today. On May 7th, we will touch much more deeply, particularly on your second bill. We look forward to your participation there.
6538	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	519YUTER2IM	2076	2084	I appreciate that and we will be working on all those issues and again I appreciate the hard work of the Committee and look forward to continuing that effort.
6539	Melendez	Melissa	41	rhQS6ToXbi0	526	553	So you have a concern about the shocking rates of domestic violence and sexual violence, but you also talked about all of the things that can be enforced on tribal lands, which is not the same, I mean you were talking about parking tickets, and handicapped spots, and things like that, and then you switched though in your statements about there being a shocking amount of sexual and domestic violence.
6540	Cooley	Ken	45	nRbBrM7qbgo	1708	1721	What is the policy driving the stages? Is it the right policy? Just because it has been on the books, is it serving us well? What's the best way to tackle these issues? It'll take rethinking.
6541	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	H96qDKzw-Aw	1663	1701	It also clarifies duties of owners and operators under the Accidental Release Prevention Program. And it makes the due process provisions of existing local agency administrative enforcement for the Medical Waste Management Act the same as due process for other organizations under these CUPAs. The intent of the bill is to enhance program compliance for regulated businesses, which they are anxious to participate in, as well. And to ensure that the programs modified by this bill run efficiently and effectively while maintaining public health, safety and environmental protections.
6542	Hueso	Ben	48	uAWOk1QkKOw	568	587	You know, this bill is based on some work that I was involved in as a council member in the City of San Diego. And in San Diego, we created a program that required the placement of automatically external defibrillators in buildings that had lots of people within those structures.
6543	Pan	Richard	96	-8HmkVu5hs8	1406	1422	So in terms of the use of that term that is not a term that is used within sort of the medical public health bill it is used by the opposition and so is not always clear what that really means.
6544	McCarty	Kevin	22	sO4d30mS8eM	1290	1309	between the months of September and December you get a free year of a essential universal pre-school. If you are a very low income family you can qualify for head start, or if you're in kind of that middle gap you can qualify for the state pre-school program. Unfortunately, we don't provide enough resources and too many kids start kindergarten behind.
6545	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	C-QK6WD4V0E	797	811	I've heard scanners from where they just touch your hands, I could do an airport, to the one that swirls around around when you are at airport and then to full-body scan, so go for it.
6546	De Leon	Kevin	102	SU8_KAMcIaE	1694	1716	In this current year, because of SB 535, because of cap and trade dollars and be mindful this is before the transportation fuels that come under the cap in 2015. There is $83.2 million, a  $83.2  million that can be spent in the current year for communities that disproportionally impacted, bad air quality.
6547	Medina	Jose	81	pyW7Y47fazc	170	194	For many students, these institutions have provided an educational option that otherwise would not have existed, but a growing number of students believe that their institutions have left them with an education of questionable quality and an insurmountable load of debt. The closing of Corinthian this past April showed that there are holes in the oversight of for profit colleges.
6548	Dahle	Brian	47	LW2wm2tITKQ	843	858	Thank you Mr. Chairman and members. I am presenting you AB 1290. It is a district bill; helps streamline the process for retrofitting our hospital which needs a seismic retrofit.
6549	Alejo	Luis	9	OGSzGIXfLs8	28	45	Yeah, you have AB 836 on suspense, AB 895 on suspense, which you said you were going to waive on, then you have AB 825 on suspense but your'e presenting them and you AB 884 due pass.
6550	Chavez	Rocky	83	dpByeg5zAi8	1099	1120	I am an old guy, in 1967 I was in high school and I could tell you when I moved in to Torrance from the barrio, when I moved into Torrance, I never saw a teacher of color, through all my time at Harwood or Torrance high school.
6551	Gipson	Mike	28	l95CGtQiXY4	675	695	At least certainly I would hate for that take place so we would again, hope that you provide the testimony and the presentation, to the best of your ability as well as your knowledge Thank you very much Mrs. Lee for joining us and you may open up  and introduce yourself.
6552	Hancock	Loni	98	KWZIJnQ_cGk	162	207	So, after that we will also have a panel of hearing from CDCR and from our community college chancellors office, who have been putting together a memorandum of understanding to implement SB 3191 but more importantly to increase the opportunities for in-person higher education that can be transferable to community colleges and four-year colleges on the outside. They've been doing really wonderful collaboration together and we're looking forward to hearing from them.
6553	Hertzberg	Robert	99	QKPlYzaLDfo	938	956	And the points, and the reason why I'm here is because we had a number of folks that wanted to testify and really make the point that this simply clarifies that counties can apply for the funds, and that this is program that was most recently reenacted, by former President Steinberg in effort to address mental health and realignment issues.
6554	Roth	Richard	106	YBJDkyF0q4Q	856	874	But for those who were not incarcerated or released from incarcerated conditions, what mental health, several of you mentioned mental health. So what mental health service is available? Are the services adequate, and what obstacles to access are there that exist in California today? Sort of a three part question.
6555	Pavley	Fran	104	VxnkQM8e4Ho	765	776	If that's a choice and direction people wanna go in the list of all possibilities, Senator Bell, I think you had that as a possibility. We'd have to really examine that carefully.
6556	Frazier	Jim	114	DFwwvEWhxJg	1310	1325	Thank you so much for coming. So, we're going to move on to Kome Ajise with Cal Trans along with Melanie Perron  Cal Trans Legislative Director. Thank you for joining us today, Kome.
6557	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	4INVuEQu1gA	2006	2023	It meets an important need in our state. It will reduce the need for remedial care and all of the other components when children don't come to their first day of school ready to learn. So with that I would ask for your consideration of this measure.
6558	Gatto	Mike	46	1ddkqgmLsnY	1204	1229	Thank you. Mr. Chairman, members. On first glance, assembly bill 139 might seem a little bit tedious or on a subject that is not that interesting, but I can tell you with a straight face that this bill is probably one of the most important things that we can do for middle class and working-class constituents in the State of California this year.
6559	Williams	Das	12	Z5dUcZuiBfw	305	324	When I pay money in the grocery store, or any of you pay money in the grocery store, you're paying for all the people who get single use bags. Whether or not you use single use bags you're paying for them. If we really believe in consumer choice we should believe that people should be able to make that decision for themselves.
6560	Mendoza	Tony	52	JT1Tm7zEIWc	846	864	Obviously, they've come up and addressed them. We're working on that. There might be other technical amendments we have been working on with some of the opposition, specifically like tolling time. We want to make sure there is a specific time, not endless amount of time that the tolling would take place,
6561	McGuire	Mike	93	6uURceuzWYc	538	560	I too want to say thank you to all of our panelists for taking the time and in particular, the preparation that it took all of you in your busy lives to better prepare for this hearing, very grateful. To all of you who are here and provided comments today, can't say how grateful we are that you stuck through the hearing and then also provided your insight as you are on the ground, implementing programs.
6562	Mitchell	Holly	64	7PzIS76lHXw	1344	1358	and let's project worst case scenario and that the news from the Feds that comes back is negative, what kind of fiscal implications will that have on the general fund this current fiscal year, and perhaps the next?
6563	Cannella	Anthony	61	k-1hI-qnp7U	333	347	I think that we achieved something that most people didn't think we could do. And it's my hope in the next couple of years that we can do the same level of focus and hopefully deliverables when it comes to transportation as well. So I'm excited to get into this.
6564	Beall	Jim	92	iJc5cTYtc4Q	933	955	Well, the vehicle licence fee has always been a "general fund revenue source", not a transportation revenue source. It's never been a transportation revenue source. It's been discussed as a transportation revenue source because I think somebody introduced a bill, Senator Huff, right.  I don't know who that guy was, but
6565	Beall	Jim	92	k-1hI-qnp7U	347	369	Thank you, Senator. Others?  Okay, we'll begin with our panel. So the first panel, I'd like to invite Brian Kelly, Secretary of the State Transportation Agency. Steven Keck from budget Director of Caltrans. And Jennifer Whiting, assistant Legislative Director from the League of Cities.
6566	Weber	Shirley	44	54O2UbeLCuE	910	922	Just a quick question, when we were chatting, because I know at one point, a lot of schools got a grant, had some money to do it, then the money went away or got folded in the LCFF, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
6567	Hernandez	Ed	103	qOUtbPV2_wY	359	377	The Surgeon General has referred to tobacco as a pediatric epidemic. This bill is a major step towards keeping this poisonous and ultimately-deadly product away from our youth, and with me I have witnesses that would like to speak in support, and I respectfully ask for an aye vote. Madam Chair, and members.
6568	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	A2CxN21_Gyw	419	438	So, this bill, I guess, is as good as we can get in a very difficult circumstance and there is just no win here, but I appreciate it, and I would like to see that at the end of the day, this is inspiring parents who have been incarcerated to start supporting their children at the first available moment. That's who this is all about. So we have a motion?
6569	Dahle	Brian	47	oE98JCD72Xk	910	929	So, if I understand this right, I'm gonna read this statement here, one of the things I read, the federal law looks at dealing with improvements in fuel efficiency and reducing vehicle miles traveled will get us to 41% reduction in petroleum by 2030. I think this is called the CAFE standard. Is that correct?
6570	De Leon	Kevin	102	ZW0bBeI7WzQ	721	741	But the reality is that we need to reduce our carbon output. That is a reality that we're facing. Because part of the cost of doing business in California has been billions of dollars on health care costs and emergency room visits by children, our children, in Northern California as well as Southern California.
6571	Wood	Jim	72	o1G7aqM68SE	830	842	The difference is we had non-dues revenue, which account for a lot of that. But, so I was just curious about that. So where would you like your reserves to be?
6572	Hueso	Ben	48	Rj2lrXkjDIw	1529	1542	We're helping with net metering which is an encouragement. We have the California Solar Initiative program which also helps subsidize not only residential, but there is a separate program for commercial.
6573	Bonta	Rob	85	0hkCdiDRiI0	406	415	We will adopt the amendments, including an urgency clause, and refer back to Health Committee, and the bill will be set for next week. So, the substantive we'll hear and will be next week. Today is for amendments only.
6574	Pan	Richard	96	YovLyNfdmT8	1381	1394	So, how that impacts when you have fewer players in the commercial market as well, especially too in terms of premium competition for people buying in the commercial market.
6575	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	iOsHLGCzh8U	1668	1686	So my question to the chiefs: Did you ever look at it financially to put this in either at the beginning or an opportunity to look at it while you're doing your study, or even now looking at, you know, what has, how has this benefited the department financially?
6576	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	iOsHLGCzh8U	1652	1668	Even though the cost may be six million, three million,  two million a year. But if you're spending ten million dollars a year in lawsuits against the department that, I think, then becomes a wash or becomes a cost-benefit for you to implement a body camera.
6577	Mendoza	Tony	52	-1v9avmnxCY	931	944	And we're talking about if it's San Francisco, or another city that has different kind of density issues, some are more rural. My particular community is, it changes, it's different, I represent 16 different cities.
6578	Bonilla	Susan	3	54O2UbeLCuE	403	420	Thank you, I certainly will. And I did want to also mention that we had Mike Radford with the Stanislaus County Sheriff's Office here earlier. He did have to leave, but he was going to give the law enforcement perspective, and is in support of the bill also.
6579	Cannella	Anthony	61	8UaA3ArF3qo	1072	1084	We also talked about treatment to the mentally ill patients, obviously they need to be treated differently and it sounds like you have a pretty robust plan in place to do that.
6580	Lara	Ricardo	107	66IpAVpTbHU	333	348	I do apologize. I'm on the phone with my bank, who ...just informed me that somebody took $3000 out of my account, so I was trying to do that and I was on the phone, so sorry.
6581	Beall	Jim	92	_rncMVWCV9g	881	892	In my county, we have a pipe that we built from a recycle plant all the way down to a power plant. It's like about six, seven aisles. So-
6582	Chau	Ed	116	rNW_uEjgPtM	1142	1173	However, the term encryption is not clearly defined in statute. Assembly Bill 964 defines for purposes of the existing data breach notification requirements and for businesses as well as for public agencies. to term encryption to mean render unusable, unreadable, or indecipherable to an unauthorized person through a security technology or methodology generally accepted in the field of information security. With that, I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
6583	McGuire	Mike	93	Pvh7fZV71H4	102	123	State and local taxes on aviation fuel are subject to the FAA rules on the airport revenue use requirements, specifically, for the sale, use, purchase, or storage of aviation fuel. The FAA is allowing the state of California a three-year transition period, which we are gonna respect, for local governments.
6584	Maienschein	Brian	84	GOY1w5EVdhE	423	447	We've has a number of people approach us from back home, asking for this and so I really want to thank you for all of the collaborative work you did on this to bring everybody together. To get all these people in support of this, definitely a great collaboration. No matter how far you and I travel, we get to continue to vote on City of San Diego issues, no matter where.
6585	Dababneh	Matthew	50	TmtzANXYgv0	1701	1714	My one question was this. In terms of the change in definition, I was reading here basically how it would go to expand the definition of commercial fundraiser for charitable purposes. What would be the defining line if someone acts as engaging in the fundraiser?
6586	Cooper	Jim	21	vnNgkCps5TE	462	475	Thank you Mr. Gibson and we have a lot of Committees going on so you'll see members coming and going from the presentations so just for information. To open our hearing, I've invited the body warrant camera manufacturer and distributor, Wolf Cam here today.
6587	Hueso	Ben	48	BdgXqTHNkdY	722	760	There was no evidence yet that the government was involved in this. This right now is pointing toward the court cartels, but there's an ongoing investigation that's involving everybody and I hope that they also look within the government organizations and the military and any entity that could have had a say in this that they be held accountable, that they be brought to justice, and that the world itself knows what occurred here and that there's justice for all.
6588	Leyva	Connie	62	bkbYI6-vC30	983	988	Very good. Thank you. I agree with what you said and, there are things we have to do, but I'm glad to hear that that's not a top priority for you.
6589	Stone	Jeff	26	kjbtobUTSlE	614	632	attended Los Angeles City College with an AA degree in paint technology, and, opened a spray refinishing business in Los Angeles called Prestige Commercial Refinishing which remained successful until his retirement. Larry was an inspiration to all that knew him. The greatest pride and joy
6590	Pavley	Fran	104	ymi21hh5WVg	2297	2380	But Kenya, in countries like that, whose whole economy relies on the tourist trade. This is, you know, the other side of the story. Right. While we're waiting for people to still clear out of the halls, let's open the roll for the Consent Calendar. Members missing on the Consent Calender, open the roll, please.
6591	Thurmond	Tony	4	uggbUvzVWb8	1596	1617	Thanks for the question. Yes, we are open on the sources of funding. Prop 47 certainly is one potential, because it references directly the issues of truancy. We're happy to work with the chair and her legislation as she brings that forward. We're open to the other sources. What is unique about this bill, though, is that this allocation has
6592	Dababneh	Matthew	50	w8nI6ofQavM	267	277	And if they have existing programs, I think your story is amazing and I applaud you for your work and for your ability to know what dogs should go to what people. And that will not change. And you have my word on that and you have...
6593	Jones	Brian	42	3I7f3vKVAeA	1028	1051	At least 7.6 million people are internally displaced within Syria and more than 4 million have fled as refugees in neighboring countries. Global warming and Syria, this is an insult to the people of Syria that are in true despair.
6594	Block	Marty	59	qapPMGGQ0rI	1722	1748	But it seems that, not having first hand knowledge, it seems that a lot of decisions by this accrediting agency have been personality driven as much as factual driven and that concerns me greatly I think Mr. Ting's bill will go a long way in making sure that personalities don't enter into what should be fact based decisions.
6595	Quirk	Bill	23	qhIgiujuUww	1094	1133	And what I'm worried about is the selective release. So for example, LA had an incident that I can't completely describe, but basically it was something went on in Skid Row. There were cameras. They released the video showing, basically, exonerating the police, which is fine. But when there is a case where there's more suspicion about whether or not the officer should be exonerated, maybe they wouldn't release it, in which case you would have a real public storm. So I'm just wondering if you can think of any way to balance things in this way?
6596	Hertzberg	Robert	99	XAJHKAVYVrw	236	249	In the best case estimates. In the best case estimates, we know and we don't actually know but we have estimates, that only 40% of these dollars actually get clawed back.
6597	Mullin	Kevin	31	dfinQbvsuZo	1248	1260	Tomorrow is the last day to notice intent to remove a bill from the inactive file to be returned to third reading by June 5th and it's also the last day to amend bills on the assembly floor prior to June 5th.
6598	McGuire	Mike	93	31Xp8hxYTr4	152	166	Now it is anticipated that the savings for tax payers in the first years alone will be significant by having one sworn police chief, no police officers, but contracting with neighboring law enforcement agencies.
6599	Lara	Ricardo	107	nqU0Ufhmqoo	402	422	A few universities have established Dream Centers, whose mission is to help undocumented students succeed in college. These centers have assisted undocumented students to raise their GPA's, increase retention and ultimately increase graduation rates. Education, as we all know, is the engine of our social and economic mobility.
6600	Hertzberg	Robert	99	X49dPLJib5g	83	99	You wanna get them all, and how do you do that, is the question, and we have not come to a conclusion as, as to how that works so, you're completely right, the question is, what's the solution to get to that very, very important public policy? Okay, Senator Hernandez.
6601	Hernandez	Ed	103	qzvpjn8Cr2Y	355	373	I don't know, but right now the way it is, and yes they have the ability to go further away but they have to have an understanding with a physician and a lot of those physicians may choose not to bring an additional nurse and they max out at the number of four. So this could potentially increase job opportunities,
6602	Mayes	Chad	79	dQgHkZmLQFo	1443	1459	Mr. Chair and members. I am pleased to introduce AB 1202. This bill would provide a reduction in the SRA fee for property owners who are also paying for fire prevention services at the local level. As we know, the SRA fee has been hotly debated since it was created in 2011.
6603	Bigelow	Frank	91	3u2iEKilpPI	1119	1141	Yes, ma'am. Going on - but it's appropriate to say thank you to you. Also, I would like to say thank you to the governor for the direction that he's taken this budget this year and it goes in a lot of positive ways. Some ways that we're all still grappling with, you know, trying to find the real meaning and end result of what would be occurring here.
6604	Gomez	Jimmy	80	E5Lv9C_D3vg	599	620	students of military families requires a superintendant or public instruction on or before July 1, 2016, to add a reporting process within the California pupil achievement data system requiring local education agencies to report the enrollment of people in military families. Do pass, A roll call.
6605	Salas	Rudy	34	GUxOzh3Wh0Q	1862	1876	And all that's being converted into renewable energy. So, is it the cleanest thing, as say solar? No, but it's a lot better than the alternative, which is open field burnings for sensitive areas like yours in Imperial or the Central Valley.
6606	Pan	Richard	96	EeHY3lg6hXA	101	117	districts that have all that more challenges that already have their resources consumed by the needs of their students and may need even some, you know, when they say external resources, you know, that technical help and so forth, unless you're planning to send the bill to the school district for the,
6607	Block	Marty	59	qnIAoFuwUn0	668	685	And it seems there are two, two types of childcare, as you just mentioned, that do fit under meeting the educational needs of your students. One being the labs for students studying childcare and development, and the other being, childcare placement for students who can then succeed, because their kids are well taken care of.
6608	Monning	Bill	25	lZ5SEmNPh-U	870	903	So first, I wanna thank you for the comprehensive overview and certainly the department is the umbrella for multiple programs and campaigns. You did focus on the current efforts around measles and protasis. Do you have your fingertips today just a quick update on where we are with either of those and what the department's doing to promote appropriate vaccination protocols?
6609	Nielsen	Jim	68	kap3kcxQfYA	1837	1861	I seek the, we seek the repeal of an onerous and very fiscally irresponsible provision that was flipped in a year-ago. That discourages fiscal responsibility of local school districts as related to their crew reserves. That area warrants a lot of attention, that issue it warrants a repeal.
6610	Pan	Richard	96	EeHY3lg6hXA	117	126	to tell them they have to hire consultants, my guess is that actually they're going to need more direct help with the resources that are attached to that, whether it's from their County Board of Office of Education, or from the
6611	Thurmond	Tony	4	r81aKKdk2dA	700	722	If I could, to the Chair I have to say that each sides have offered really compelling testimony today. This is the debate of the week for me, because what I'm quickly learning up here, it's neither, in this area of government, it's neither this, it's neither that. It's a little bit of both and then some and I think each side has presented that.
6612	McGuire	Mike	93	D1U0Ojzunqk	1905	1928	Senator, we can be using those resources more robustly. I think we're in agreement on that. But quite frankly, it's gonna be making it a priority. The biggest issue that we have right now in this state is we are way under resourced. I'm gonna use a statistic that Director Bonham from Fish and Wildlife gave us at our fisheries and aquaculture herein.
6613	Hertzberg	Robert	99	6r30p-6PJFA	999	1013	But we have to create the realistic mechanisms to make that work. Let's send the signals to the market. Let's deliver this in a way that works. Let's fix this underlying problem. I ask your support for this important measure.
6614	Chang	Ling Ling	18	oIrgXGq-Z_I	931	950	I just wanted to comment and say that I really appreciate the author for the bill and appreciate the consideration for all the stakeholders, and the industry and hope that we continue working with industry on some clean up, but thank you again. I will definitely be supporting this bill.
6615	Gipson	Mike	28	l95CGtQiXY4	90	105	The State Auditor also reported that some of these decisions may have been detrimental to the rest of the judicial branch, especially in light of the significant budget cuts to the judicial branch and the courts.
6616	Hertzberg	Robert	99	scqfU4UsUAo	1170	1180	You know in my past life, one of my many iterations as a haberdasher I was a partner in a child support collection agency. And I've got some experience in this business and it's a great cause.
6617	Leyva	Connie	62	MpQ4SGzO7GE	220	239	Okay. And I, I understand that and I'd like to see that in the bill. The other question I have is in the letter that Airbnb sent requires websites like Airbnb to turn over unprecedented and broad swaths of sensitive user data to cities and counties across California each quarter.
6618	Hueso	Ben	48	UK_Tt44TN2Q	170	193	This bill will allow them some additional time. It creates a window which is either immediately and no much more than five years to adopt a compliance program to begin to remove chromium 6 from the water tables.
6619	Liu	Carol	63	gN6B3iXXHo0	547	571	With 73 rented, 7 vacant, and 3 not habitable, and 27 multifamily units which, with 19 rented, 4 vacant, and 4 not habitable. While Caltrans is proceeding with draft regulations that I believe, address both concerns regarding sale of the properties. One last issue warrants a legislative remedy.
6620	Monning	Bill	25	gB0SqdP0x6o	1178	1197	So, to fulfill our commitment to the rehabilitation side it seems like we've perhaps not invested enough in the drug treatment counseling side of rehabilitation. So, I can just join my colleagues in that observation and thank you for being here today. Thank you.
6621	Hertzberg	Robert	99	G2qYCBsWgfA	1541	1554	When they get a nickel, they wanna tell you that they support it, and they don't look at the other side of the ledger. So I do think if you were to look at this holistically, and not based on the 4,448 subdivisions of government that we have in California.
6622	Hueso	Ben	48	9SvrzWegmgM	1102	1112	Thank you, Mr. McKeeman. We'll go to-- well now, we'll hear from Phil Verleger, which is the economist and consultant to the Western States Petroleum Association. Welcome, thank you for being here.
6623	Mitchell	Holly	64	o6dY6yB1_H8	69	82	The SBC, the summary of benefits and coverage details what is covered under health plan and explains coverage limitations. It provides definitions of key terms to consumers to help them evaluate and compare their health insurance options.
6624	Patterson	Jim	119	uolbChB4jBI	160	177	I have with me today: my constituent Gary and his colleague Willy Schumacher with him, as well as other members of the disabled community Maria Valencia from Resources for an Independent Central California, to voice their support. Gary?
6625	Bonta	Rob	85	2aV-8k1n6pw	595	613	Miss Cantwell, Miss I want to thank you again for being here and spending so much of your day with us. I want to just ask you a two part question and it's this. As you sit here today what Medi-Cal provider rate increases do you support to increase access to care for Medi-Cal patients?
6626	Wieckowski	Bob	55	XCFU_0j8dAo	1736	1751	I've got all the other indicia of vulnerable impacted community, I just don't have the rail there. I mean actually, Oakland would probably not qualify, because the high speed rail goes on the other side of the peninsula.
6627	Dodd	Bill	71	nQyRqNn-8MI	99	115	Mr. Chairman and members, thank you for the opportunity to be here today. AB 41 requires the Department of Community Services  and Development CSD to recommend a plan for state-wide low-income water rate assistance program.
6628	Holden	Chris	78	gunU8ZfZPfs	197	218	Thank you Mr. Speaker.  There's a committee report at the desk relative to the SB 643 McGuire, I request unanimous consent that the committee report be deemed read and deemed adopted, and to suspend Assembly rule 63 to allow Mr. Bonta to take up Senate bill 643 in mock-up form without reference to file for purposes of third reading.
6629	Nielsen	Jim	68	BllaAgaiebY	730	743	The people up on the ridge have even assessed themselves to keep the lookout going, and so this is a very sensitive issue and there needs to be a quick response and the CCC folks are always very, very helpful.
6630	Lara	Ricardo	107	GA4ZqtiJNoE	337	361	This bill expands Medi-Cal eligibility to include those individuals. As noted in the analysis, the state already is providing limited healthcare coverage to this population at an annual cost of $1.4 billion. Remember, that's $1.4 billion of which $690 million is a direct hit to our general fund. This is annually.
6631	Lara	Ricardo	107	GA4ZqtiJNoE	362	380	Enrolling people in comprehensive coverage is not only a more humanitarian approach. It is also more cost effective to ensure people have access to preventative care, wellness programs, as well as receive treatment before the condition becomes much more damaging and again, much more costly.
6632	Jones	Brian	42	YRy2ye6IBrE	1793	1810	14 to 0, that measure is also out. Doing the people's business in record speed this morning. Are we ready for Mr., do we wanna go with Mr. Mullin or, or Miss Eggman? Do we wanna do add-ons right now or?
6633	De Leon	Kevin	102	Q1vYBQdDLNc	1270	1288	As you know, Canada serves as one of the United States' greatest allies. In addition to sharing a border, our two nations sure many mutual interests and partner on a multitude of issues ranging from energy to the environment to security and defense.
6634	Garcia	Cristina	112	pY9wY6wExdc	1066	1087	Under current law, you do not need to report when a girl and boy, both seventeen years of age, engage in involuntary heterosexual sex. But when two boys, both seventeen years of age or two girls both seventeen years of age, engage in voluntary sex, a mandated report is required. The only difference is their sexual preference.
6635	Hernandez	Ed	103	fUpA9iRHn2E	156	191	Thank you. One more announcement. We have Tanya Homman, who will also be testifying for DHCS. So with that, we're going to go on to item number 2: overview of the fee-for-service Medi-Cal provider moratorium. Can we have the department come up and go ahead and get started.  Good afternoon and welcome. So I am going to have to call Jennifer and ask her why she didn't show up.
6636	Leno	Mark	60	Sai1lZPOK9g	248	276	We all have shared this history, we all know what this is about. But the question is, I think from some of your responses, I have a sense of what the answer is, that the 115 year is somewhat arbitrary, but not all that arbitrary. But I also, and I think we need as a committee to look at what likelihood there will be, should this go forward with 115 years in it.
6637	De Leon	Kevin	102	Q1vYBQdDLNc	1321	1339	Just recently, as many of you know, I was in Lima, Peru in December representing the State of California where we engaged with three, four ministers of the environments from various provinces, from British Columbia, Ottawa, Alberta, as well as Quebec, so issues and cap and trade.
6638	Chau	Ed	116	AtEtvEwPM9c	1159	1184	A recent survey of 46 100% affordable housing projects in the Bay Area, found that about 2,000 parking spaces out of 5,600 went unused. Those unused parking spaces cost well over $100 million to build. The funding for affordable housing comes from public sources, including voter bonds and low income housing credits.
6639	Bloom	Richard	2	MO4QFekCxFk	1963	1989	Modern medicine helps me to not suffer that same fate. They were genetically predisposed. But what of the juvenile population today who are the victims of this new epidemic which is totally preventable? It need not exist. That's what motivates me.
6640	Thurmond	Tony	4	0KEfgNXXt_I	774	794	of education or there's a issue. And if the Assembly starts to intervene now, where do we stop? Where do we stop on the issue of boundaries? And if we do this here, as said previously by the Chair, his precedent-setting, next week I guarantee you, there will be a bill from another member. And so where do we stop it?
6641	Hertzberg	Robert	99	CKAXbjP6mGQ	1186	1208	We are the predictors. If there was no market they would not exist, right? In 1900 ladies and gentlemen, 40% of the cars in America were powered by steam! 38% by electricity and only 22% by gasoline! 14 years later 99% gasoline.
6642	Holden	Chris	78	xdTTK0YoutY	1587	1608	Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Persuant to Assembly Rule 96, I request unanimous consent to re-refer the following bills to Committee: Assembly Bill 1087 Grove from the Natural Resources Committee to the Transportation Committee only, AB 1405 Grove from the Health Committee to the Human Services Committee and the Accountability and Administrative Review Committee.
6643	Dodd	Bill	71	F7lT9yIrGAY	622	639	For decades fire agencies have been charged with providing fire protection and emergency medical response services to our communities including those communities that host UC and CSU campuses and the campuses themselves.
6644	Melendez	Melissa	41	b7XHatlYhkw	1556	1567	Just because you work for a legislator and you may or may not have a grudge or an axe to grind, does not mean that you don't deserve the same protection as everyone else in this building.
6645	Bloom	Richard	2	g3vVJbVncqM	818	903	Well, thank you both very much for a very interesting and informative set of presentations. I think you can tell we all appreciate your being here this morning and ask, if you can, to just stick around through the next round of presentations and then we'll have a little bit of time for a round table discussion. Thank you. And so now I'd like to ask to step forward as I introduce you, Stuart Cohen, who is the Cofounder and Executive Director of TransForm, a powerful and effective voice for world class transit and walkable communities in the Bay Area and beyond. And we also have with us Michelle Passero, who is the Senior Climate Policy Advisor for the Nature Conservancy, the California chapter. She has over 15 years of experience working in land conservation and environmental law and policy. And finally, we welcome Strella Service who join the California Environmental Justice Alliance in 2008 and now coordinates their climate and energy campaign work and oversees organizational development for the alliance. Welcome to all of you. Thank you for being here and participating in this panel on land use, environmental justice, and adaptation. Welcome.
6646	Leno	Mark	60	YKXU5BUfkbE	66	80	Reviewing changes made and the revision, and allowing us to get to our work here today. It is a lot of hard work, many, many long hearings with a lot of public comment. That's our process, it's inclusive, and I say thank you to everyone.
6647	Allen	Benjamin	70	eHKo1SK8Zvs	1539	1550	My only little comment, Mr. Chair, is that I, you know, I've, I've been hearing good things about the LPAC, very interested in kind of seeing as it develops, and we've got a bill relating to English language learners, so that's an area of interest for me.
6648	Hernandez	Ed	103	JM1ztwrhmks	1577	1585	But when you talked about pricing of Sovaldi, you obviously used a bunch of catch phrases which we mentioned, but what I still heard is what the market will bear.
6649	Dodd	Bill	71	-Nb5xJu_Rq4	812	823	I'm working with the committee, stakeholders and the department on the proposed author amendments to help minimize cost to this program, and will continue to do so. Thank you Mr. Chair.
6650	Monning	Bill	25	HebbT5qrJn8	1088	1127	And that is helpful and I do appreciate it wouldn't be 100% of IHSS case load, but just given the difference in cost gives us at least something to do some estimates of even a very conservative estimate of a third of IHSS recipients requiring that full-time care clearly. For when we look at this in economic terms, the State of California has been innovative in the establishment of IHSS. It has saved taxpayers millions ,if not billions of dollars with this more economical approach.
6651	Olsen	Kristin	15	GYqLytCM9KA	602	651	Thank you Mr. Speaker and Members I rise in support of AB 1347. When we talk about improving the business environment in California this is one example of what that can look like. AB 1347 creates a fair and reasonable path for California's public works contractors to get paid for extra work performed. Those working and working to build and maintain our roads highways public schools universities and airports should not have to wonder when or if they will get paid for the work that they performed. This bill helps provide some surity to the contractors and those the emply that they will be traded fairly and paid in a timely manner, and it's a responsible approach that also protects taxpayers and the public. I'd like to think this author for bringing this import measure forward and for working with the stakeholders to get it to a good place. I urge an aye-vote.
6652	Wieckowski	Bob	55	9Kkq97ccCr8	652	674	It's an interesting claim, but on the tiering. So everybody knows, I've abandoned the 10% ratchet down. Under this bill, the garnishment remains at 25% which is what the opposition wants. What it does is it graduates up to that based on what your income is.
6653	Pavley	Fran	104	MJvFThfrsHs	75	86	And with me today is some representatives from the military. This bill is supported by all branches of the military as well as Natural Resources Defense Council and the Sierra Club. It doesn't get better than that.
6654	Irwin	Jacqui	16	_gd0KmtJp10	1007	1023	According to Deputy Kostiuchenko's former shift partner, Eugene was a hockey fan, who loved the LA Kings, loved wine tasting, good food, conversation, he had an amazing sense of humor, and most importantly; he loved his family and all his animals.
6655	Quirk	Bill	23	fN4pkjiLQ7U	148	168	San Diego county so a large county with a substantial urban area. To your knowledge of the type of data that Assembly member Lackey and Senator Hancock have discussed, to what extent is that available at the local level, at the police chief level, at the sheriff level?
6656	Pan	Richard	96	VyoFcVtTJtQ	152	162	And if we can do it through rodeo, we can do it through whatever else, let's figure out how we can incorporate that, but I mean one of the things I'm concerned about, looking at the language, it just says high school rodeo.
6657	Mullin	Kevin	31	1O51OMdLA-4	497	517	Thank you Mr. Low, seeing no discussion or debate on this item, the clerk will open the roll. All members vote who desire to vote. (repeated) The clerk will close the roll, tally the votes. Ayes 48. No's 21. Measure passes. File ...90 it's ...62
6658	Weber	Shirley	44	uuwAxYppIw8	722	751	We have law enforcement and then we have the community. I mean that's real clear. Just in listening to the testimonies and the people who have come forward. Because I want a bill that I, that provides some leadership and transparency as we move forward in this. I wanted to make sure that our body cameras didn't come, become the next tool that people didn't believe in. Because it didn't have enough transparency or enough engagement in it. And that's one of the reasons why we looked at the piece about can you view it, can you not view it.
6659	Hancock	Loni	98	MYXfbp9UhLY	192	207	Yeah, I mean, all that information is public information. Unfortunately, our current CalAccess system doesn't make it very user friendly to provide that information in a more easier to digest format, but we're working on it.
6660	Chiu	David	7	yWoCiMPFJpk	934	955	I'm going to have to start. So first of all let me start by thanking the members of the public and saying that I very much respect the diversity of opinions on this question and want to thank folks for coming to express their perspectives, as well as, to the difference of perspectives that we have in this committee.
6661	Lara	Ricardo	107	Gf9OHu0urRM	928	942	The other question I had, when we talked about the out of state students, you referred to undergraduates. What are the numbers for the graduate students, and how many of those are international students?
6662	Hueso	Ben	48	GHyOxyKfubI	746	762	And we think that this is the best possible bill that we could put together to insure that there's universal public safety. Or health and safety for people when attending places that have big congregations of people.
6663	Lara	Ricardo	107	tHDAU5JmwzE	705	723	Six to one. That measure is out. Next item is SB 484, juveniles do pass as amended to require a re-evaluation of the methodology in four years. Substitute the roll call from SB 254. That bill was approved on a unanimous vote of seven to zero.
6664	Gomez	Jimmy	80	rzSOQHmJW3U	0	29	A roll call. SB 347 Jackson, Firearms, do pass. B roll call. SB 443, Mitchell. Forfeiture of controlled substances, do pass as amended to remove provisions regarding reallocation of revenue. Remove provisions regarding attorney's fees in court appointed council for civil asset forfeiture proceedings.
6665	Rodriguez	Freddie	69	_MyNlUiIS5o	92	111	I can tell you from my own personal experience that violence in the ER is more common than we realize. These workers deserve the same level of protection whether they are performing their duties inside or outside of a hospital. I'm here to ask respectfully for an aye vote. I have here representatives from the Emergency Nurse Association to testify in support of the bill.
6666	Leno	Mark	60	l1HWjxTN3mM	205	224	And I think it's time that California listen and take action. The mission of our public schools is, of course, to educate all of our children and this bill re-establishes our commitment to that very mission. So as amended I would ask for your aye vote and I have a number of witnesses here today.
6667	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	NEf6zh-NPIY	1557	1584	You can stay home with your child, you just can't pay rent. What this bill does will increase the amount that they can draw down on, it will strengthen the amount of time that they can spend home with that child, but it's no additional cost. Employees are already paying this, and unfortunately it's underutilized. This is a great fix with no additional burden on business. I just want to congratulate you on bringing this bill. I am so excited to vote yes.
6668	Wood	Jim	72	2gM15KHmKpo	815	830	266, while it mentions the environment, does not deal anywhere close to what I'm doing. I've been working very closely with those authors on that and we have, they have, at this point allowed me to continue working on these particular issues.
6669	Rodriguez	Freddie	69	gdqTdEZLl0I	2268	2276	When they're closed, if everybody's closed in the area, in a sense everybody's open cuz where you gonna go? You gotta go with closest and fortunately make accommodation to accept your patient.
6670	Stone	Mark	20	_0FvACJKmKc	576	602	Yeah, has taken on that obligation within the lease, then clearly they're the ones who are liable. And even if there's liability to the landlord, if the lessee has indemnified, the landlord in that circumstance, then to the extent that the landlord is damaged, the obligation, the responsibility then falls back on the lessee. This is what we still need to be addressing.
6671	Wood	Jim	72	2gM15KHmKpo	804	815	I will tell you that all these bills are being amended. This is a very complicated subject, and even just the environmental aspect of this in trying to work on cultivation has been really, really challenging.
6672	Frazier	Jim	114	WL8066nF9bw	1772	1785	However, I expect that LA Metro will thoroughly consider safety-related issues before deploying the longer buses, and I look forward to their success. Madame Secretary, can you please call the roll?
6673	Thurmond	Tony	4	L_fXwOpVblo	813	823	I don't wanna just get hyped up, 'cause right now I'm feeling hyped up. They want my blood, I don't want it. But what is your central problem that has lead to this concern that we need to protect against?
6674	Nguyen	Janet	65	cFLwRY925G8	646	660	Because at the end of the day, what I've always said, having been on CalOptima and a lot of other healthcare issues in Orange County, as a county supervisor, I've always said that I want to make sure that we have 10 hospitals for over 3 million people, not one.
6675	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	mb2tyA5yp6Q	1497	1513	They're, that some of the patents people that create are fascinating, and really take us to far and more advanced places. And of course here in California, where we invent the future, it's an important issue.
6676	Hertzberg	Robert	99	_NTagRCFfsc	599	610	And we're going to ultimately, Senator Ned, has suggested do like a informational hearing, and try to figure out priorities and what to do on these tax codes. And having this data would be very helpful to us.
6677	Baker	Catharine	74	zuSJjHHSsa8	666	676	It does. I think the additional question would be if there are any other technologies that you??re aware of, you know, we??re always looking for new technologies or innovations, especially in the Bay Area.
6678	Jones	Brian	42	kIKVbsrTmqg	1342	1353	And I think that, you know, I'd be willing to make a motion today that we move forward with it. And hope that there would be, you know, bipartisan support on this bill. And that we'd be able to take some action on it today.
6679	Stone	Jeff	26	Ea-UVDMoM1k	1741	1761	Middle class Americans, low-income people, and we have this obligation to do it. And we shouldn't just say, well, we're gonna siphon off, and silo, the biggest issues that are gonna be the most contentious because they could interrupt the budget process. It is the budget process that we should be addressing these issues.
6680	Dodd	Bill	71	nZHmIMh0aaI	605	619	Yeah, I'm wondering where is the, you know, like you have Major League Baseball. You have the National Basketball Association. You have the management of those organizations really overlooking this, having drug policies.
6681	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	A2CxN21_Gyw	322	353	Thank you! Other witnesses in support? There any witnesses in opposition? All right, I appreciate this. I sadly practiced in this area for many years and what's so frustrating to me is that when someone is incarcerated, the burden to care for the children, in addition to other burdens, falls 100% on the parent who is not incarcerated.
6682	Wolk	Lois	94	rTtHKpIYZjo	843	895	Thank you Mr. Chair.  Thank you  both of you for your Initial discussion. I have just a couple questions because many of the things that were suggested by you in your presentations I'm really interested in hearing from our next panel and asking them a number of questions. Let's go to 1E first. Again, the administration's proposal is to move monies in these three areas out the door very quickly, so there by truncating the budget process and the ability of budget subs and the committee as a whole to really delve into this and make certain that the money is being well used,recognizing that there is an interest in doing this quickly and meeting the voters intent.
6683	Hueso	Ben	48	31W9cfaQWLY	939	974	It's very important to urge them to vote. It's very important to find ways to bring them to the polls in a ways preserving the successful democracy in the world. Hopefully we could be a beacon for the rest of the world to follow.
6684	Stone	Mark	20	9Kkq97ccCr8	1824	1842	And especially you've heard from this body, Senator, that mostly interested in the low-wage workers who are less likely to afford it and not pushing them further into trouble. So with that, there is a motion. Can we get a second?
6685	Stone	Jeff	26	OHqd1YALBQA	902	917	And one of their chief concerns was, they said Senator please do what you can destabilize the minimum wage. Don't increase the minimum wage because we have programs that provide a subsidy so these people can work.
6686	Leno	Mark	60	Lkk9mVJ5y6k	2047	2078	Ms. Bosler, I know we're not talking about large sums of money here. But, referencing the conversation we just had a few minutes ago and the previous item. Your recognition that we're still legally challenged with regard to SRA, it seems like it might be a stretch. To be using these funds for archeological and cultural requirements per AB 52. Why would we not go with the timber tax?
6687	Dababneh	Matthew	50	ROiUoxqGjEc	1026	1042	This bill is directly modeled on the Wolk legislation and applies provisions similar to SV 785 to school districts. It is important to note that this bill does not require school districts to utilize design build, nor does it touch traditional design, bid build processes.
6688	Hill	Jerry	66	sOBgcRfjdRA	1250	1265	Okay thank you. And you know just to kind of reference Senator Wieckowski's comments and if I heard him correctly he was implying that since in California we have hearings, we have a public disclosure,
6689	Olsen	Kristin	15	G4RiUnTMom4	1077	1095	Growing poverty erodes the middle class in our state and places the California dream further and further out of reach for our students and for our families. With a quality education, we can change that. With good teachers there is no limit to what our children can achieve.
6690	Nazarian	Adrin	36	bgIZ8epTm-I	1466	1490	Time and time again we have heard opponents argue that regulation and any law will threaten app based transportation and stifle innovation, AB24 does not jeopardize at based transportation companies. Nor does it apply any regulations to the technology behind this emerging industry.
6691	Beall	Jim	92	6q5JSfST1YQ	1307	1322	You know, that actual mileage will be counted as part of this adventure to look at additional-- an increase in gas tax allocations. So that's-- So you're bill is correct. You have to have that maintenance of good repair.
6692	Patterson	Jim	119	ohOGzwAGjR4	930	952	The the reliability of the grid and the cost of, of electricity is absolutely at the heart and core of California being able to be competitive. So I mean, I'm hoping that those who have expressed some modifications or some reservations would be would be, would be heard.
6693	Weber	Shirley	44	BcOJ4WzBt0M	678	695	And when that happens, we end up at the state level, having to pay for the services that should've been covered under Veteran's Services. So that was the reason why our committee recommended that we do the funding, that we don't hold it over until the program ends to start talking about funding again.
6694	Bonta	Rob	85	gB_BkuvgLvc	1073	1104	Thank you. Okay, we're going to move on. We're going to go to public comment. I'm first going to set a couple of quick ground rules. Firstly, and thank you to all of our witnesses, to our authors I want to say that, I deeply appreciate that parents have brought children here today. It has exposed these chidden to our government and taught them an important lesson about civic engagement. And I hope they also leave knowing that nearly every issue has multiple sides to it, as we've clearly discovered through today's debate and that reasonable people can differ.
6695	Hertzberg	Robert	99	Q93W3yN07bU	430	446	Thank you for the point you just raised but, in a practical matter, I know from refuge people and the fact that people were stealing pipes from the Central Valley and they were taken them and getting cash and the problem that was creating.
6696	Anderson	Joel	57	bcyIxM2tSYs	1107	1117	I was good to go, until I heard that testimony, and it really impacted me because the reason that I like what you're trying to accomplish is, I want to increase the number of people voting.
6697	Pavley	Fran	104	rpVWOZ1bEow	217	246	We're going to, thank you very much for your testimony because I wanted to go onto the responsing. But I'm looking at Assembly Member Stone who wanted to ask a question. And my staff tells me just as a FYI that Oklahoma, because of the concerns of seismic activity is stop using injection wells this summer. Some of them that are close to potential fault lines, etc. Assembly Member Stone?
6698	Stone	Jeff	26	07ilphfHuEw	618	635	Use technology. We could cut billions of dollars out of waste. This Legislature has a perpetual addiction to spending and doesn't want to cut to save money so that we don't have to lean on our constituents to pay yet more taxes
6699	Thurmond	Tony	4	MhUK5oG1VcQ	860	874	And I want to thank you and shout you out, Ms. Cortino. Thank you for your advocacy and the work that you're doing at the East Bay Law Center and I just want to encourage you. We're proud of you and encourage you to continue and thank you for bringing forward this bill with the author. Thank you.
6700	Hill	Jerry	66	qXgW2NUq_uc	204	214	I think what we're looking for is a strategic plan in place that can look towards the workforce, I mean I appreciate your efforts in the workplace trying to encourage more--
6701	Wagner	Donald	88	WFR0WnMhSS0	1005	1030	I'll be brief because the bill in front of us is a good bill. The bill prior to the amendments the author was forced to take, in my mind, was a great bill. We've had 25 years to comply with the ADA, we hear. All the lawsuits are just about parking and bathrooms and inches matter. We hear.
6702	Nielsen	Jim	68	07ilphfHuEw	643	669	Madame president, ladies and gentlemen of the senate, I will... I cannot support this today because of concerns over the totality the budget and our considerations there in. Observing in part that over these last toughest years in state history, the actual number of state employees is not decreased
6703	Grove	Shannon	77	G-cKeAHj51U	44	54	I do have a couple of questions on your bill, though, just because I'm curious about why, I think it's voter, I think voters are just disenfranchised. They feel like it doesn't matter.
6704	McGuire	Mike	93	qbDN-8u61LI	1149	1161	Reason why we're looking at Measure D is because it was a voter approved initiative, but that is an issue of my word that we'll continue to discuss regarding the County of Los Angeles. Thank you.
6705	Patterson	Jim	119	qCEr8jDp5Hg	1964	1979	Thank you. Appreciate the opportunity to I guess, exhibit the fact I'm new. Mister Chairman, I was prepared to be here today and vote in favor of this, and was a little surprised about it going to suspense.
6706	Wood	Jim	72	TYBUIhFGo6I	1846	1854	I wanna thank everybody for being here today, and staying through the entire hearing. And we will reconvene again on December, 15. Thank you very much, I appreciate it.
6707	Nielsen	Jim	68	S3aN4yPTnBE	1794	1812	Chief Yamamoto, thank you so much for your courtesy being with us here today. For this section, Mr. Boylan is joined by Lindsay Sin, Deputy Secretary Women's Veterans Affairs, and Murtha Villareal-Younger, Deputy Secretary Minority Affairs. Mr. Boylan, would you like to commence?
6708	Mitchell	Holly	64	fVP93psOcMo	1788	1801	Right forty times two. I'm going to really cut you off the two minutes because as the first group of public testimony witnesses exhibited perfectly you can make meaningful profound statements under two minutes.
6709	Bigelow	Frank	91	FZTo8zIUL5Q	1850	1866	Well I appreciate it. Again, I'll just close it up, Mr. Chair. I'm just gonna be one who danced in and out a lot for a lot of things that are happening today and I kept my pulse of what was happening in here and listening as I was in multiple places.
6710	Block	Marty	59	Ouu9P0a4sNE	1265	1290	And that's okay that's, that's very helpful too. Last question, we talked about Miss Plate talked about the, merging into one unified system of special ed and general ed. I understand how that might be done easily, or fairly easily, in the K-12 or, yeah, with, with single, or multiple subject teachers.
6711	Cooper	Jim	21	V2DWmVVPp4I	6	14	And I'll just follow up on Mr. Chu's earlier thing with the state being so big, there's a lot of different departments that do their own thing. They really don't communicate and that's a big crux of the problem.
6712	Frazier	Jim	114	mltOigqY7Qc	1150	1170	Got it. Excuse me. Are there any members of the Committee who'd like ask any questions? Do we have a motion or second?  So, we have Mr. Dodd as a first and Medina second. Ms. Kim is second.  Go second. For the Dodgers. So, Madame Secretary, please call the roll.
6713	Salas	Rudy	34	fmIaR7hDQ6w	1130	1143	Are people working together to find solutions? If not then how is that being bridged? What's really happening on the ground level for the folks that you guys are dealing with? Yeah. Mr. Boyer, thank you.
6714	Morrell	Mike	51	x7KeOiOAgeY	203	224	Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Kathleen Foote. I just have a clarifying question going back a half hour ago. I heard you say that you had initiated some investigations, and you made it sound like in fact a backroom deals and you used the work collusion too.
6715	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	Zewkjo1Xkzc	463	477	Thank you very much. Appreciate your testimony, and apologies the system is certainly not perfect. Thank you. Other witnesses in support very briefly please? Make it just very brief please.
6716	Levine	Marc	8	yAgUQvRrkrQ	391	407	Additionally, this project will include adding a bike lane to the bridge to close a significant gap in the 270 mile bay trail. Initial estimates for completion of this project where as long as three years. AB 157 is helping speedup that process by as much as 18 months by requiring that the design work be done concurrently with the environmental review.
6717	Allen	Travis	43	8bOmzPkZfE0	2069	2085	They're public schools where we get to try out new and innovative methods to educate our children, to get ourselves up from the ground from this deep pit of being 46th in the nation which is abysmal, and something that we should all be deeply ashamed of and try to fix every single day.
6718	Chau	Ed	116	gT2_z9UGrSs	688	708	Absolutely. Thank you for your question, first of all the intent is not to create a separate categorical program under this particular project. In fact, it is different from any other regular categorical program in a sense that this is not a mandate. This does not mandate the school, or any particular school district to adopt this particular plan.
6719	McCarty	Kevin	22	RoufXhlsVZI	513	529	And probably today, a lot of other downtown businesses are finding ways to benefit from that, as well, but it wasn't always that straightforward. You're working with the city, and trying to make that be a positive for everybody. Can you just talk a little bit about what that experience was like?
6720	Block	Marty	59	71FNaoH1Uwg	1427	1445	These folks have an objective to harm the State of Israel, to change the State of Israel's action and that's fine but that's now what we're debating today. They certainly have a right to think that Israel is bad. Why they don't go after other countries that have much more gross human rights violations than Israel, I don't know?
6721	Block	Marty	59	BvEiMZK1K8A	867	885	MS affects more than 400,000 Americans across the country with 200 new cases diagnosed weekly. For more than 55 years the national MS society has offered services to people with the disease. They provide more professional education programs than any other MS organization.
6722	Hancock	Loni	98	CbiDjtIZ5Og	1534	1566	And there's an issue of would it lead to improved training which I know is of interest to both the department and the union if the additional person was an outside person not selected from inside the department, who doesn't want that and why?
6723	Harper	Matthew	14	B_DlPPzaBGc	1549	1561	Excellent so the property owner has the option of just paying it completely off if they felt they wanted to do so, or allowing the new property owner who benefits from the improvements to the property to be able to continue to pay, it's the sellers' option?
6724	Fuller	Jean	49	-zapzAXTnLg	1241	1266	Presidents for a number of years. It hasn't been solved because it's difficult. But I do believe, as our Pro Tem, that we can be a new era together. And, we can find a synthesis. I do not believe that we can find a historical solution that's been going on for a long-time. I do believe we can find a synthesis. But I
6725	Pan	Richard	96	JwS_raJ5ApY	878	895	However, the disease did not spread beyond that because there were sufficient vaccinated people in the immediate community to prevent further spread to the state. However, recent events have shown that California's losing this protection as the number and size of places with significant numbers of unvaccinated people in the state has grown each year.
6726	Dababneh	Matthew	50	eYvHQ6iO6CE	216	236	He was able to do so where out of network costs would not affect his family. They wouldn't affect his family to pay out of pocket up front. For many people in my district and across our state, they do not have that luxury. To pay up front to wait several months to get a reimbursement check.
6727	Mitchell	Holly	64	elxm9FjpDgY	91	105	as your table shows on your agenda on page 24. The case load is slightly lower than it was before. We think that may be related to the general decline in the teen birth rate but it is a restored program. Happy to take further questions.
6728	Nielsen	Jim	68	-yLqvo8WX6M	729	740	We want to do things, let's do them in a scientific manner. Let's have counts. I'm happy to amend the bill to include that there be such a census.
6729	Hernandez	Ed	103	qzvpjn8Cr2Y	970	985	Well, you know. If I can't make a difference in the State of California then I shouldn't be here, and by making a difference means you bring up difficult issues, that's why they elected us.
6730	Dahle	Brian	47	LoBHmtPnzP4	1180	1191	I guess the crux of my question is, how can we spread it out, save the money, and not make the rate payers of California make other states an advantage over us in a competitive way? Does that make sense?
6731	Monning	Bill	25	suW9diU5Tzo	197	214	I know you had some of that testimony also earlier today. As a committee, you've heard from foster youth and advocates on behalf of foster youth that the system needs to be changed. SB 253 seeks to address this issue. I respectfully ask the committee for its' aye vote.
6732	Mendoza	Tony	52	r1L5ziee2-s	182	195	While diseases like the flu seem like a minor inconvenience for you and I, it can be deadly for young children. Last year in the United States, 20,000 children under the age of five were hospitalized with the flu and a hundred of those children passed away.
6733	Wieckowski	Bob	55	nrJtkVtsuec	391	405	The author suggests that we're gonna get more bang for our buck in reducing greenhouse gases. If we do set up a threshold or give CALSTA. Do you disagree with that?
6734	Hill	Jerry	66	XrOqCob7jCo	1256	1272	Very good, thank you Madame Chair. SB 671 allows lower cost biosimilar drugs to be automatically substituted by a pharmacist. It also requires that the pharmacist communicate with the physician about the substitution within five days after the prescription is filled.
6735	Leno	Mark	60	N5kRSRB-qaQ	252	270	So, unfortunately, or fortunately, depending on your opinion, there's no requirement for, or any need for, flame retardants to be included in these products, but because of the nature of the manufacturing process, they may yet have.
6736	Bates	Pat	58	D-fVk6CkUDE	1271	1284	And work out something so that there's a balance there as our folks who can afford to get in the toll lanes, don't congest them, so that the folks that can't afford those toll prices are not pushed out.
6737	Mitchell	Holly	64	zKRXexcG8LM	142	156	As these bills have gone to the legislative process, we have heard heart-wrenching personal testimony from current and former foster youth who talk about their experience having been prescribed various psychotropic medications.
6738	Lara	Ricardo	107	8ENPCPUYlKU	501	531	result in workers being three times more likely to need state-funded welfare services of one kind or another. According to the 2012 report by the UC Berkeley Labor Center, temporary workers are quote, "on the whole, younger, more likely to be female, less likely to be white, non-Hispanic, and less likely to have a high school diploma." 39% of all contingent workers lack healthcare insurance, and 18% of them rely on public health insurance.
6739	Block	Marty	59	iMCgrPZ8vzk	92	112	made annually here in California to millions of California consumers who rely on them and thousands of people employed by the lenders who make those loans. So this is an important issue for the California Legislature. Although we're not the ones crafting the new rules, that job is being done federally by CFPB, it's important that we understand the potential
6740	Patterson	Jim	119	u8oZZTgP2Tw	1021	1044	I'm looking at the language of the Governor's veto,  I'm not sure I see that kind of opening here. Is there something new in the Governor's understanding of this?
6741	Hernandez	Ed	103	BDjsPtF4Upk	1645	1663	Members, thank you for your time and consideration. We had a hearing not too long ago this issue for the second time. It was a lengthy two-hour hearing, and yes, this is a difficult issue because there are two entities on opposite sides.
6742	Beall	Jim	92	B0PWp2aeSfk	1434	1449	And I'm not familiar with the facility, I'll be honest because that was one of the, I visited quite a few of them, but that's not one that I have visited. I'd like to go see it in terms of the facility itself.
6743	Hall	Isadore	1	H5As3s88-Eg	66	104	I think these provide that comparative service, but I also think we need to do a much better job in diversifying their ability to be able to be successful and continue to exist in our communities. Like Senator Hueso said, visiting these centers, you see that they're struggling, and we need to come up with ways to ensure that they be more successful, and I think part of that bringing those young veterans, asking what they want their clubs to look like, what their VFWs to look like, so that they can also feel that they're part and incorporated into what this new center's going to look like as we move forward from here.
6744	Gaines	Beth	109	AAng3WP84Ks	1395	1409	He also worked on the Mondavi Center, located next to UC Davis, on the same campus as UC Davis. Mark's company worked on the repairs of the capitol steps after they were damage in the early 2000's. He loved to fish and travel in Lake Tahoe and Bodega Bay. He was an active member of the 356 Car Club of Northern California.
6745	Quirk	Bill	23	GxQLQjba08A	774	793	So, Mr. Bender, with regard to the $5 million for defense, had that not been a revision, had that gone straight forward, it still, would it have needed a vote by the commissioners to approve the $5 million for the lawyers?
6746	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	37JGlYuk31E	441	472	And, you know, you come to the United State's and you actually have access. Everybody has access to vaccines and it seemed unbelievable to them and scary that their young children their young babies who could not be vaccinated could be subject to these diseases that they have seen first hand in horrifying ways and so to say it's not a public health crisis when one of the closest urgent cares to my district has to be shut down. Because kids showed up there with Measles.
6747	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	OIbMOKdbCjk	843	876	Are there any other privileges of the floor? Seeing none. Seeing none, thank you again reminding to the women Senators, please stay after session and we'd love to have a photo with you as well.
6748	Campos	Nora	76	kmplgTQ8GXM	998	1017	The Agricultural Labor Relation Board found them at fault, yet could not enforce the order compensation of the farm workers. This exposed many challenges that the Agricultural Labor Relations Board has still has to address.
6749	Mitchell	Holly	64	3ozy7hrhoXs	1354	1366	Are you coming up? Okay. Looked like you were out for a Sunday stroll, I wasn't quite sure if you were going to the front of the hearing room or-
6750	Anderson	Joel	57	_4l4q_6Hap0	2103	2130	Are there other witnesses in opposition? Assemblyman, would you like to address that in your close, or would you like to address it before your close? The reason why I ask is I have a couple of questions for you. And now they allude me, but the last question I was gonna have was I'd like to be added as a coauthor.
6751	Chau	Ed	116	2Dc5I9_7zFA	1895	1911	The intent of the bill is to incentivize developers to build more affordable housing, so one way to do that would be to lower these parking ratio so that they could realize some of these benefits from providing less parking spaces, so that they could basically use the money for more affordable units.
6752	Hall	Isadore	1	-PZnzyI1C5I	972	991	Okay, I think we've cleared the docket, and we have been here since 9:30. Time now is 11:30 and this is the longest G.O. meeting I believe I've conducted over the last several years, and I pray the others don't go as long.
6753	Bonilla	Susan	3	mCVaWE-xXHw	1639	1661	to review the language, the Spanish language examination if the pass rate does not improve in the next year. We are very concerned by a very low passage rate in the Spanish language exam. In addition this bill makes technical changes to delete references to obsolete codes sections and update references to other agencies. And I have with me
6754	Bonilla	Susan	3	6dKd_uGq3Mo	1334	1347	This is extending the sunset date for the Dental Board to January 1, 2020. And it extends the sunset date for the Board of Vocational Nursing and Psychiatric Technicians from January 2016 to January 1, 2018.
6755	Leno	Mark	60	YKXU5BUfkbE	1096	1136	Could you talk to us a little bit about the dynamic between the Governor's grant proposals and the? I'm sorry. One second. We're gonna break just for a moment, and establish our quorum.
6756	Ting	Philip	30	rDGVmGQNitA	57	82	I know that if it wasn't for the preschool that my daughter is in right now, either my wife or I wouldn't be able to work and that's just the reality. I think we were in a more fortunate situation where we could actually pay the exorbitant San Francisco childcare slots which were much more than what I paid to go to UC Berkeley, and no where near as good the education.
6757	Rendon	Anthony	120	cBCfsH22JkY	141	155	I also draw to the committee members' attention the story, I believe it was this morning from yesterday's New York Times where the state of Oklahoma has acknowledged the relationship between fracking and earthquakes.
6758	De Leon	Kevin	102	SU8_KAMcIaE	2077	2105	Ok, colleagues, we're going to move on forward with our agenda. We have two other governors appointees before us that are not subject to  appear, however they are subject to confirmation.  We have file item number two, that is Katherine C.Pettibone, member of the Boating and Waterways Commission, as well as Mr. Randy M. Short, again, member of the Boating and Waterways Commission.
6759	Daly	Tom	118	1AD-QUnKZQc	97	115	This requirement is simply unfair. And it can delay or prohibit the disposal of a property which is unsightly or poses a hazard to nearby residents. My bill fixes this problem by ensuring that the delinquent taxpayer remains responsible for the unpaid property taxes.
6760	Block	Marty	59	hxZ4kK3mSXo	564	578	But I think that it's a well meaning, well-intended resolution. So, I will support it as chair, and seeing no other comments or questions, we'll bring this to a vote.
6761	Weber	Shirley	44	1dDkNt95rgU	2187	2203	It should be clear that the policy that currently is in place is not because the CSU recognized its error, it was because of the outrage of the legislature and the students concerning the increase in fees. That should be understood. So it's not that they undertook this effort because of that.
6762	Stone	Jeff	26	JK2AAP7nJZs	1984	2003	I want to support the 99%, 99.8% of all district attorneys of follow the law and do the best they can to enhance justice in the State of California. And let's not have a knee-jerk reaction to one bad D.A. in Orange County and not allow the District Attorneys, the good ones in Orange County continue to do the great job
6763	Bonta	Rob	85	wEqNM_ksYTE	2	17	- Next we have items number one and number eight, both Assembly member Mullin's bills, AB 50 and AB 461, and immediately thereafter we'll be going to the special order of business item number 14, AB 775, Assembly members Chiu and Burke.
6764	Beall	Jim	92	qVTBTq0n9T8	239	275	I'd like to ask Mr. Kempton the same question because he was the head of the original assets sales tax authority. And then worked with Orange County so he might have an opinion on this issue. So streamlining projects, how do we instill that, and also Director of Caltrans. How do we instill that confidence in the efficiency of our delivery organizations?  And what we need to do?
6765	Dababneh	Matthew	50	EWFYx7q92DQ	1404	1421	people to sell and try to pawn store merchandise. If this was the only game in town I could see why this would be a great concern. I will urge the author to continue to work with the opposition to try to find common ground where possible. But clearly if someone has stolen merchandise, there are number of places where they can all ready sell this online with far
6766	Wieckowski	Bob	55	1kHDjtxLuww	189	205	So I'll bring up, I'll ask our next panel to come up, and this is the state adaptation efforts. We have from the California Department of Food and Agriculture, Amrith Gunasakara, and he's the science adviser to the Undersecretary Houston who was originally scheduled to come here.
6767	Pan	Richard	96	eQ53gxbhFGs	1176	1195	I'm pleased to hear from the former mayor of Santa Monica how popular they've been in his city, and we'd like to bring it for other cities that are interested in having this to create this opportunity. So my municipality feels that this law is necessary to make that happen here and would certainly appreciate your aye vote, thank you.
6768	Hancock	Loni	98	BDjsPtF4Upk	126	144	Ensuring that childcare providers are trained to recognize and report child abuse will help them be fully effective in carrying out this role. The bill has had bipartisan and unanimous support throughout the process. I would ask for your aye vote.
6769	Medina	Jose	81	K-Xyfp8wckY	388	407	As our staff has discussed, there are a number of recommended amendments in the analysis that are in line with our over reaching goals and I'm happy to accept these. There are other recommendations that I would like to keep working on with your office and with stakeholders as the bill moves through the Education Committee.
6770	Nielsen	Jim	68	aXebDhCekK4	1351	1362	and your agency but we've had some really bad experiences particularly up in Siskiyous and very heavy handed approach to thing so that's why I'm very sensitive. Do you understand? Thank you.
6771	Beall	Jim	92	m8iyuGdEmL0	1434	1452	It does, it doesn't impede the building inspectors, fire code inspectors, etc., in terms of the functioning of their duties. To fully inspect buildings for the codes, the public safety codes, the fire codes, and so forth, right?
6772	Wieckowski	Bob	55	jna-qIkO0Wg	842	864	I mean, if our old dams are such that they're designed to collect the snowpack, maybe the new water storage should be a smaller, nimble flood control vehicle. A reservoir versus the traditional larger capacity dams.
6773	Maienschein	Brian	84	va2JElQwc4I	1243	1260	If an individual is not receiving such intensive treatment or evaluation services, no such recommendations can be made and no LPS conservatorship may be contemplated. At the same time, the probate code governing traditional probate conservatorships only allows for treatment of conservatee in a secured facility
6774	Hill	Jerry	66	JX3K3k4qzkE	1254	1270	Other questions? Now move the bill. We have a motion from Senator Berryhill. This is, move the bill to...Please call the roll, we have a motion from Senator Berryhill. Correction to transportation, housing.

He was arrested in his early twenties for refusing to go to internment camps.
6776	Mitchell	Holly	64	7wM-SWUAGJQ	689	707	Colleagues, we've had several former colleagues as guests on the floor today. Earlier, we had former Senator Runner and please join me in welcoming Senator Joe Simitian at the back of the chamber.

6778	Mitchell	Holly	64	fkvme1Ux-zg	769	803	Senator Fuller, I would like to thank you for bringing them to our attention. And we would like to thank all of you men and women for your service and acknowledge some of your colleagues to join with you in the gallery today, as well. So colleagues, let's give them a round of applause as well. Senator Hall, for what purpose do you rise?
6779	De Leon	Kevin	102	aItBzVMycEU	1454	1480	Thank you very much Mr. President and colleagues, thank you very much for a good debate and I want to thank my colleagues from the other side of the isle for a good debate and I appreciate the feedback. A couple points I just want to either perhaps clarify or explain for further explanation and by all means offline we can go a little deeper into the weeds if need be.
6780	Lara	Ricardo	107	ptq5V1Fu0ok	256	278	And now for better order, by author's name, pay close attention as we will be addressing measures that will be up for a vote this afternoon. We will announce the author, measure number and provide a brief description of any amendments to the measure applicable. With that we are ready to begin working through today's business.
6781	Chau	Ed	116	D85P8H59LjQ	1124	1143	Thank you, next witness. Any additional witnesses in support of the bill? Seeing and hearing none, let's go to opposition witnesses. Seeing and hearing none, let's bring it back to the committee. Questions, comments from committee members? No takers?
6782	Mathis	Devon	75	U0AuDbfVwBc	440	452	I understand, I'm very familiar with the training program, I have friends and family that work in such facilities. I'm talking about the ongoing training portion, for not just them, but also for your own staff.
6783	McGuire	Mike	93	MpQ4SGzO7GE	1285	1299	Just to respond to that, I hear you and I really do appreciate the Senator who was talking with me about that. And I hear that concern, but that is also a decision on the local side. We're not taking that up at the moment.
6784	Gipson	Mike	28	r0_c68VZXFY	1131	1146	And I believe that this resolution talks and brings people together in the Watts community to celebrate the 50th years that what transpired and how we're moving forward and how we're prospering as a community.
6785	McGuire	Mike	93	MpQ4SGzO7GE	1299	1314	If that law is thrown out, that's gonna happen on the local level. But right now, there are laws on the books, because city councils have decided for whatever reason, and I don't, I'm not sure why they would decide that they decided to not have vacation rentals.
6786	Gordon	Richard	117	_Z7ChiMRbIg	380	407	If this bill moves forward today, I'm committed to continuing to work with all of the parties engaged in this dialogue to see if we can't get closer to a more comprehensive solution and that we can't find a way for producers to bear some responsibility. It's been mentioned that our colleague, Assembly Member Mullen, has a bill in this arena also.
6787	Stone	Jeff	26	4-5ngRp_LtI	546	560	There are wine labeling standards in California that ensure that a wine that is labeled from a region comes from that region, and this is adding Monterey to the list of Napa, Sonoma, Pasa Robles and others throughout California.
6788	Wagner	Donald	88	jAVMxyN_c9U	876	897	And when we get close to it, we'll have another bill from the successor to my colleague from Isla Vista or some other successor, changing the rules again. We should have stabbed this beast AB 32 when it was first before this house.
6789	Wieckowski	Bob	55	vpNS8YXwTNY	262	287	Alright, those are the supporters. Before we hear from the opposition, staff report does raise an issue. Mr. Leopard, if you can address it. It doesn't specifically say 1990, it's 50 percent of what level and it was sort of, I don't know if it's a drafting omission but we want to be some clarification of what is the 50 percent. What is the baseline?
6790	De Leon	Kevin	102	DDRuG0CC7zE	1249	1260	Obviously, I think that with a growing economy in California, us being the 8th largest economy in the world. We do surpass Russia as well as Italy we are on the hill of passing Brazil.
6791	Wagner	Donald	88	jAVMxyN_c9U	846	861	And they would continue striving for the standard of living that we have given up here to meet these goals that keep changing, and the earth would continue along the path that it's going now, no matter what California does
6792	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	6gxr39Gyjlk	1716	1741	AB 678 provides funding to our state ports so they can invest in energy efficiency projects, improve air quality around the ports, and continue their effort to be green. These investments will not only further reduce the environmental impact associated with the ports but have the potential to lower port operating costs resulting in improved competitiveness and job growth. With that, I have a couple of witnesses here, Mr. Chair.
6793	Gaines	Beth	109	EgZgFkyj3MQ	1563	1639	The Association showcases India's glory to the residence of the greater Sacramento community at large and for our future generations. I'm honored to be representing such a wonderful community. As a host family for a rotary foreign exchange student from India, I learned a great deal of respect for the Indian culture. That's why I feel it's so important to recognize this Association. Colleagues, please join me again and Assembly Member Coolly, in welcoming the indian Association of Sacramento.
6794	Hueso	Ben	48	Tb_ZR86SMpk	684	724	SB 328 would ensure that attendance right to know and, the ability to take precautionary measures against pesticide exposures are forwarded to them. this bill would require the land landlords and property managers to provide tenants with notifications almost identical to those currently provided by professionally license operators in order to ensure tenants are fully aware of the pesticide products used in their homes and allow tenants to take any needed precaution to avoid pesticide exposure.
6795	Hernandez	Ed	103	o_iCJQqprWQ	1457	1472	I'm not saying this shouldn't be don't, I'm just trying to figure out the most efficient way how to do it. With regard, I got a question for you but, you know, with regard to the readmission penalties ,obviously that's at the federal level through Medicare and believe to Mr. Chavez's
6796	Hueso	Ben	48	GUxOzh3Wh0Q	1556	1575	Furthermore, I mean this is I think when we're talking about renewables, we're talking about projects that generate energy that also have a beneficial impact on the environment, that this bill open up eligibility for those projects as well.
6797	Mullin	Kevin	31	KEeiqVKf9vU	1076	1115	Ms. Waldron is asking for a no vote. Mr. Holden is asking for an aye vote. Mr. Waldron is asking for a no vote. Clerk will close the roll. Ayes 51, no's 26 the motion carries. Mr. Holden you are recognized.
6798	Thurmond	Tony	4	DunUs63qSXI	1422	1437	And in that respect, I believe that you've helped us deliver both today. You've given us some good marching orders as we start out with the committee and we're looking forward to our ongoing work together. And with that, I'd like to thank you very much and we are adjourned. Thanks.
6799	Lackey	Tom	10	mNyHP9HDpqk	2034	2049	So however, the cost is a reality and as Mr. Ridley-Thomas has clearly pointed out, there is another side of this story that I hope that we can work this out. And if things aren't amended a little bit, I may not be able to support it on the floor.
6800	McGuire	Mike	93	X49dPLJib5g	425	446	we went through the transportation and housing process and I want to say thank you, to Chair Beall for all the work that he put into this he put in a lot.

6801	Gallagher	James	108	vnNgkCps5TE	1393	1420	I'm just briefly, again, I'm here to listen and learn. I wanna hear more about how the body cams actually work, what they do capture. At least one concern that I've heard from some of my officers is that you know certainly having body cams will help with some greater transparency and so you can see exactly what occurred.
6802	Hernandez	Roger	37	MO4QFekCxFk	1424	1442	Thank you Mr. Chair. Thank you to the author for your passion on the issue. I know that last year I supported a bill that was similar in its intentions. It was a labeling bill that came before Assembly Health last year. I've been 100% in support of your intention.
6803	Beall	Jim	92	Ol0PhdDSV8c	93	109	We need to track and analize some of these programs and use our resources wisely in accord  to a comprehensive strategy to reduce the impact of the transportation sector on our climate environment, our health
6804	Williams	Das	12	n5MXFS_19l0	1142	1157	Why isn't the criminal justice system the place? And why would we even be asking campuses where they don't even live on campus do this? And the reality is because there's no other way to provide this accountability in society.
6805	Mitchell	Holly	64	3ozy7hrhoXs	511	527	Any comment from Finance or LAO? None. Okay, I'm gonna hold all public comment until we get through their entire section 4140, and we'll take the public comment on the items, okay? Moving on to...
6806	Leno	Mark	60	tqB--Js_f48	1551	1564	And a lot of the Governors work in recent years has been about returning controlled to local governments as oppose to having the state dictate to them how they should conduct there own business.
6807	Wolk	Lois	94	_JbASqkciSI	1501	1514	and I would be glad to bring the bill back or just discuss with the Chair, as well as the Chair of Ag to whom I also made the same promise that we will have that resolved and I mean it this time.  Alright.

6809	Cooley	Ken	45	gunU8ZfZPfs	523	570	In this session a group of us in the two houses rolled up our sleeves and tried to make progress. A vital part of that actually, is just seeing what is happening, in our own House, actually, a critical moment happened in this House when two bills moving through our policy committee structure proceeded in the Appropriations Committee in our House, and in that process, sitting down with the chair, discussing this idea, that you've got two strong bills with the potential move forward, but seeing some of the difficulties of conflict, we were urged, counseled to find a way to put that together.
6810	Nielsen	Jim	68	0J9n2c3eCds	86	99	Thank you Madame Chair and members. It's a delight to bring the first bill to your attention of the year. I'm sure there are many to come. SB 37 allows the Department of Water Resources to reimburse this particular local agency for construction of a flood control project,
6811	Hertzberg	Robert	99	_QWOBYYvqfo	771	781	You're talking about 2 1/2%, two point something percent, Mr. Numbers Man, of what you're doing on your state tax. What does that really mean in terms of a charging station? What does it cost?
6812	Hill	Jerry	66	4RPfdYzqQQc	11	24	And I know that as a Committee had the discussions about it, but it's important that we do it in a way that's fair and since we haven't had a policy related to that in the past, as we roll it out, we want to make sure that we do it appropriately and in a time-sensitive manner.
6813	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	99NWh04_JOI	1811	1821	But don't they, after they do the exam, then say here, and write, aisle 10, next to aisle 11 is the LensCrafters company and here's the prescription for you?
6814	Melendez	Melissa	41	BcOJ4WzBt0M	281	288	Thank you. My apologies for interrupting, but since we are holding this open, and it doesn't seem to be unanimous consent as to what to do with this item.
6815	Bigelow	Frank	91	nsi_dMaCc9g	1108	1126	Let me be clear. AB 452 does not create a new fund, it does not impose a new fee. AB 452 simply creates a sub account within the fund these monies are currently deposited into, to avoid any confusion as to how these funds should be dispersed.
6816	Maienschein	Brian	84	mgO95LX_sqE	792	812	So I wanna be sure and clarify that. Generally speaking, we work very well in a bipartisan fashion. But today I'm not totally certain on that. But I do wanna thank you for bringing this measure. I know it's important to you personally, and to your region. So thank you for bringing that. And with that, you may close.
6817	Cooper	Jim	21	nqF3kpXMpbA	140	151	And I think life would be dramatically different. But, like I said, we can sit here and talk about it to death, and until that really changes it's not gonna happen. And what does it require?
6818	Williams	Das	12	cr1U1amFOTo	1831	1864	There sure is and I think it's important to indicate that in this discussion of course, the specter of over-generation keeps on coming up. Senators, we still have a problem of under-generation in the summer that is much larger where we are not producing enough renewables in the summer because we haven't built enough renewables. And we're still dependent on old natural gas power plants, and people complain about paying for solar we don't use in the spring during over-generation.
6819	Bloom	Richard	2	toyLEHK5bMU	1566	1584	and over $100 million in state and local tax revenue. It allows cities to retain public parking lots that don't generate revenues above their maintenance costs and on and on and on. These are the things that have been negotiated in this very lengthy and complex set
6820	Ting	Philip	30	87MaMZIVBPA	243	258	TNC so we won't, I won't go into great detail about it. There is, there is simply this bill allows TNC's to do what cabs can already do without the fairs, I respectfully ask for your vote and would be happy to answer any questions.
6821	Eggman	Susan Talamantes	73	HccZsvAseDo	1452	1470	Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I stand on behalf as the chair of the LGBT Caucus. Urge strong support for a ACR19. California, as everyone knows, is the home of many API people who have been here since California became a state. Arguably, California would have struggled to provide a lot of the infrastructure in the early days when the gold rush was going on.
6822	Galgiani	Cathleen	95	162iDtQT3ZE	1141	1161	I'm going to be supporting the bill, but I just wanted to comment. It was my former boss, Senator Pat Johnson, that did the initial legislation. And it, in great part, was because at that time we didn't have cell phones. And there were a lot of people who were reliant on the public at times when they would break down, and they would have to take rides from strangers.
6823	Hill	Jerry	66	843OfhKnV14	669	686	reporting language that asks the PUC to state what it is doing to keep rates low. I'm happy to work with the committee as the bill moves forward to find the best way to add the language back into the bill that we inadvertently took out of the bill.
6824	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	maPB0VHfdFQ	1456	1471	Good afternoon Mr. speaker and Assembly members. Today I am pleased to present ACR 43, which will designate this week march 23rd  to the 27th as California aerospace week.
6825	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	XG9g8L3IwGU	329	346	Again technology is very exciting and offers a variety of potential uses but we need to, we need to make clear what the rules are. Because a lot of people don't know that this kind of behavior is an intrusion and isn't reasonable or acceptable.
6826	Hernandez	Ed	103	51wXJ30ZLf4	1269	1288	And ideally it'd be perfect if everything was covered, if all medications were unlimited, etc., but what I have to look at, and for me, the absolute most important thing is the success of the Affordable Care Act, but more importantly the success of our healthcare system.
6827	Hancock	Loni	98	KNTNNHrdr9E	699	722	Yes, I do have a comment. I'm certainly gonna support the bill today. There are many very good things in it. I would like to say that I'm disappointed that the Conference Committee's $25 million appropriation for after school and summer programs fell out of the budget during the agreement with the administration.
6828	Mendoza	Tony	52	vPceAWe-pfQ	115	128	Thank you so much. Thank you. And again if members begin to present, we'll have to vote in support. To people in opposition, and we'll just start going through the process. Limit the comments to three minutes.
6829	Hertzberg	Robert	99	5xYY96cBqDg	16	33	do we have AB199 Eggman? This makes it easy.  We need authors.  No authors, no hearing. Got 90 seconds. It's lunchtime. Huh? It's lunchtime. 80 seconds. I like the way you run. That's right.
6830	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	-eBMHFfPn-c	747	765	Just acknowledging your work on similar issues related to pharmaceutical safety, consumers, the health care delivery system and efficiency. Certainly respect your role at the business and professions committee. My concern is not unsimilar to what was mentioned my Ms. Weasels from the plans about consumer confusion.
6831	Calderon	Ian Charles	115	2UaCkYNmz0w	14	27	While we wait on members, we're going to pass on the option of Committee rules. We are going to get right into bills. Today we're going to be following our agenda order.
6832	Frazier	Jim	114	zuSJjHHSsa8	7	17	Kome, one of the things that has been highlighted today, by Assembly Member Baker was the newspaper reports over the weekend that highlighted the faulty radar on the Bay Bridge.
6833	Monning	Bill	25	hnhklV-igrA	133	151	I appreciate that. The spectrum though in terms of the ratios that are shared, one in a million suffer in allergic or adverse reaction, whereas with tetanus, one in 10 who contract tetanus is fatal. Do you disagree with that?
6834	Burke	Autumn	6	sA6uJxeRGKk	112	128	individuals with few choices for care outside of a nursing home. In my district alone 4 centers have closed leaving over 420 of my constituents without the care that they have relied upon. AB-1261 provides some of the stability to our remaining providers in the community based adult services program.
6835	Hueso	Ben	48	ewcXToh_gOY	796	810	This is not a problem that, that, that requires the State's involvement because these are laws passed at the local level. And many times where locals say you know, State stop passing, you know, mandates to the local level.
6836	Chau	Ed	116	2X-V6mACHAA	496	518	Thank you. Additional supporters? Anyone in opposition to the bill please come forward. Anyone opposed? Hearing and seeing none. Questions from committee members? I do have a couple questions if I may. You mentioned that, of the 21,000 units, how many of them are affordable units? Was it 17,000, or there abouts?
6837	Hueso	Ben	48	ewcXToh_gOY	783	796	I, I, I suggest that you, you take the amendments for now, just to keep the bill working. I think this is an area where there should be some legislative work. I believe this is a local problem.
6838	Mullin	Kevin	31	Zr9Ph03Ms5A	1367	1394	Mr. Dababneh is asking that the first roll to be open for co-authors. The clerk will open the roll. All members vote who desire to vote. This is for co-authors, co-authors adding on ACR 39. Members wishing on to add-on. The clerk will close the role. There are 78 co-authors added. Without objection, we may take a voice vote on this item. All those in favor say aye.
6839	Lara	Ricardo	107	qbKF38sndDw	592	610	6-1, that item is out. AB 693, multifamily affordable housing renewable program, do pass as amended for the author to strict program to solar energy systems and amend to make clarifying changes. To substitute the roll of AB 2, the bills approved on a 5-2 with Republicans voting no.
6840	Maienschein	Brian	84	H1w8G5JZSXc	328	341	AB 618 bridges the gap between the important work we entrust to a prisoner's primary mental health clinician and the parole analysis prepared by the Parole Board's independent evaluators and I would respectfully request an "aye" vote.
6841	Cooper	Jim	21	C3fC_QKuL0U	1125	1138	Now, I'd like to invite and welcome our second panel today on the same topic. Edwin Perez, a legislative advocate for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and Stephanie Winn executive director for Asia Resources Incorporated.
6842	Bonta	Rob	85	merVIEmEWtA	1480	1496	In terms of what we're doing as a state, and outreach. In terms of some of the increased administrative costs for better, more effective outreach. Is California Doing, are we sort of State of the art with respect to what other states are doing? Are we lagging behind? Do we have a comparative sense of how we measure up with other states?
6843	Hernandez	Ed	103	2nTGfRwIGSk	689	713	This would be the third iteration which has a five year sunset and your goal is at the end of the five years to be able to self sufficient so that you have enough revenue in reserve so that you don't have to come back to the State of California. What if that doesn't happen, do you anticipate coming back to the state again? Or do you see it going and moving the patients into Medi-Cal, and then I do have a question.
6844	Ting	Philip	30	sx5Murt3em4	1415	1433	So I guess where I'm trying to get a better understanding of, you know, what, what is really being impacted by the general fund. Not, noth, nothing that is really off the books, whether it is sort of a housing function, whether it's a food function, or whether it's a catering function. Those all, those all sort of pay for themselves.
6845	Pan	Richard	96	t4_AyYAahhk	703	720	So I would say is, first of all, I appreciate looking at outcomes. As someone whose been involved in quality improvement in my own field I know how important outcomes are, but as we look at quality improvement we recognize, you know you have outcomes, and then you also need to look at inputs that go into outcomes.
6846	Leno	Mark	60	BvL-PHidNXM	1350	1386	So well be keeping this open. We've just gotten word that the Assembly floor is completing its work for the day, so our Assembly colleagues have to get back to their floor to cast some votes. So we're going to recess until 3:30. Sorry for the interruption. Our committee is returning.
6847	Mitchell	Holly	64	H96qDKzw-Aw	973	990	This bill is only putting a cap on the child's council, which only represents half of the total dependency courts, so we think that 33 million, yeah, is, is an overreach. Today I have here with me Ed Howard with Children's Advocacy Institute to testify in support of the bill.
6848	Garcia	Cristina	112	oyGJSKS61pM	693	703	that you support the bill as we move it forward and with the commitment that our goal is to make sure the concept is flexible for everybody. I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
6849	Leno	Mark	60	11yyICoQ5m8	954	971	So we have an opportunity, this is keyed fiscal. So our vote today would be to move it to appropriations. It's in some ways a process question. Do we want to continue to work out of here in the policy committee?
6850	Lackey	Tom	10	oGlT-6EtEZU	110	124	AB 353 will provide a very narrow exemption for the taking of a fully protected species for a habitat restoration project by the Los Angeles county Public Works Department.
6851	Hall	Isadore	1	5cbDr55Nnpw	558	576	Officier Andre Lanear has received 21 compensations for excellent police work in his time with the LA PD and most of those were earned conducting foot beats in skid row. He also recently completed 36 hours of the most comprehensive mental health training available for patrol officers. Officer Delano Huchens has received 23 compensations for excellent police work during his time with the LA PD and has excelled as a community relationship expert, working foot beats in skid row.
6852	Lackey	Tom	10	oGlT-6EtEZU	102	110	And I would like to extend my most sincere thanks to the committee and committee staff for the substantial time spent working with me to get a solution to this legislation.
6853	Gray	Adam	27	qX9LkjyICPY	1109	1120	So, if you could, those that are still up here at the panel and those who have maybe, perhaps moved into the audience if you could do that we'd appreciate it very much. At this time, we're going to move to public comment.
6854	Baker	Catharine	74	gCJqYiGvi7w	343	359	Thank you, Mr. Chairman and thank you Mr. Dababneh for looking for ways in which we can be advancing technology that makes transactions easier. And I applaud you in that effort. I do have many concerns about the bill which we've preliminarily discussed and I wonder if we can chat about those right now.
6855	Monning	Bill	25	Xps8YHyq2fA	1345	1359	It's not just having the money follow an individual client who's transitioning, but it's also gonna be a function of how strong and robust that foundation is of community and regional center support.
6856	De Leon	Kevin	102	Mt9BcU600uM	1125	1142	Oh, I'm sorry. I apologize. Let me rewind this back a little bit. Those who have come here to provide any commentaries of support. Please come on up. We have a microphone right over there.
6857	Bloom	Richard	2	QruWeQOWjh0	560	578	We're not just behind it in, in terms of being behind a bill. But, if they're putting their dollars up to support it, I'd like to see $50 million on the table as seed money to support a campus like this, before the state starts allocating money.
6858	Achadjian	K.H. "Katcho"	5	nkFf3IHgULc	1379	1404	Two years ago the legislator created a rebuttable presumption that a dealer did not have knowledge of the intent to export so long as the vehicle is registered in California and the sales tax is collected. Unfortunately California's motorway vehicle protection laws did not anticipate that certain auto manufacturers will ignore these recently passed laws in export and resale policies.
6859	Wieckowski	Bob	55	scqfU4UsUAo	2313	2337	The average home price in California is $415,000 or $455,000. It keeps going up. And the CPI that we've been hearing about does not apply to the homestead exemption. It only applies to the other exemptions that we have. It's not to the homestead. So that's, there are protections that are already built into the federal code and with that I will use that as my close.
6860	Pavley	Fran	104	aMmnutMx8lk	1782	1805	The financing authority that was offered. On a separate note, discussions are continuing with semi-tropics in a different arena and the goal is making sure all actions lead to the adoption of sustainability plan not separate tracks.
6861	Irwin	Jacqui	16	i194v81Ek5E	43	63	Good afternoon, Mr. Chair and members, AB 931 would increase the time frame that veterans are eligible for the hiring tax credit created from the 2013 economic development initiative. The tax credit is currently available for hiring veterans who have left active duty within the past 12 months.
6862	Hancock	Loni	98	vEySB-JPx9Q	416	443	Unfortunately, that was removed from the bill on appropriations, but the other piece of the bill is still very good and very practical. It says, that you can get good-time credits for completing rehabilitative programs or for having good behavior and no disciplinary actions while you're in solitary confinement.
6863	Weber	Shirley	44	AHTUrQ6AUYA	72	82	These students, though English speakers, do not have the skills necessary to both read and write the English language at an adequate level, making it difficult to succeed consistently in an academic setting.
6864	Weber	Shirley	44	AHTUrQ6AUYA	95	112	There, there, there has been some small successful programs in academic English mastery programs in LA Unified School District that adhere to this population. But there exists no formal large-scale effort to funnel these students into programs that can have positive effects on their long-term outcomes.
6865	Mitchell	Holly	64	MTWW-DN4Tdo	533	560	that pales in comparison to the hundreds of hours, collectively, spent by budget staff, personal staff, the LAO, and their development and research, and publications on the budget proposals, finance, the various state departments. I am clear that this is truly a collaborative effort and none of us could be successful without the participation of all of us.
6866	Brown	Cheryl	13	yFQH5D8dVds	451	482	Yeah, that wouldn't fit into this person.  Okay, the other thing is that many of these businesses need to have bonding, they need insurance.  They also are finding that insurance companies just won't sell insurance to them, so they're kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place.  When the job is requiring it, the state is not helping and even private business won't give them the insurance.
6867	Gatto	Mike	46	N6EhWxD1_nY	143	152	You know, things that are, when I hear a face mask I think of something like bleach. I think of something that is immediately detrimental to one's respiratory system.
6868	Mitchell	Holly	64	7PzIS76lHXw	976	995	for several years and that's also kind of fueled some of my frustration as a legislator in getting clear answers to what appear and feel to me to be clear questions with regard to the department.
6869	Hertzberg	Robert	99	9Z8rBNEmUBE	606	627	Excellent. Thank you very much. Madam Vice Chair, any questions of the support before we go in the opposition? Any members? Questions? Senator? Senator? Senator Pavley, any questions, no questions? Doctor? No questions, just one final questions of the esteemed Assemblymember, just because this is the first time he's testified, and
6870	Leno	Mark	60	b8mZhVlBtpE	938	961	Additionally, we know that every study, every report that we've seen clearly indicates that children who benefit from early care and education are better prepared to start kindergarten, better prepared for first grade. We can address the achievement gap before it starts by investing early.
6871	Lara	Ricardo	107	qM5DAHMb8ig	539	558	Members, we are, now, going to take a moment to take up some of the items that we have on call, to allow members to vote. S, SB 302. Secretary, please call the roll.
6872	Gaines	Ted	24	SQUPcyDaRgg	55	79	This bill is aimed at protecting the vehicle's owners personal privacy rights by ensuring that the location and speed of a vehicle remains private and is not needlessly sent to the state board. With SB206, California will still be able to meet its clean air goals while not turning into a surveillance state.
6873	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	yhx1NvxzAgA	923	940	And so to prove a case beyond a reasonable doubt and to a moral certainty becomes a question to a jury or a judge who's the trier of fact, whether or not that recollection is strong enough to create that kind of evidence for a conviction. So we have that issue.
6874	Lara	Ricardo	107	SuJy5eE040k	1505	1517	And so I just think that doesn't just bode well, I mean is it just expected that we're gonna just approve this. So you know, I have issues with that as well. So just to note.
6875	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	9xlCmdTyLME	425	438	I just want to briefly chime in on that. Me too, as well. I share concern that we overuse antibiotics rather than use some very solicitously as required. This is a topic we've been talking about this on this floor and in this house for years.
6876	Grove	Shannon	77	VuyRexRzUE4	1752	1772	Elaborate a little bit more. If it is going to be transferred are we getting a fee for it, is any of that revenue that's part of that property value going to be serviced and brought into the community so the people in the community aren't living at a poverty-level or below poverty-level like Mr. Anderson stated? What's going to happen to those resources? Are we just giving it away or is it going to be or any of these resources going to be funneled back to the community so the communities living in a poverty-level?
6877	Hertzberg	Robert	99	1-lHMg2FsZ4	698	719	Yes, that's one of the questions we asked. I'm trying to understand, I'm trying to say, so you're saying that if, if I'm, let's assume I'm in a state that doesn't have a distribution system, that doesn't allow, that prohibits my distribution system and I wanna buy one of your vehicles, or a vehicle from one of the electrical car companies that Mr. Wieckowski, Senator Wieckowski just referred to.
6878	Wagner	Donald	88	4YUeKJp9AQ0	1186	1214	All right, I would like the author if she would to address the issue raised further by Mr Quirk. The Homeowners Association, we're told, wont be responsible.  I understand that, but there are fiscal concerns that they raise. Because when there's a finding of substandard conditions, the tenant is often times, at least if not all the time, relieved of obligations to pay rent.
6879	Chau	Ed	116	bgwj3wqmbCQ	1238	1254	Got it. Okay, thank you. And just a follow-up question for Mr. Schwartz. This is the same question that I raised earlier about the increase from thirteen percent to the fifteen percent threshold. Are there any downsides to doing that at all?
6880	Burke	Autumn	6	vyfz8Yq8ZGw	1727	1745	when I trigger saying I'm an available driver, that is when I would then be available for a drug test, not when I am not on the app as an available driver. Does that make sense? Either one of you, he may have to explain how the app, driver app works, but I don't know.
6881	Weber	Shirley	44	N_ZNvKt6lzQ	720	740	AB 1218 makes a number of changes in order to address these issues and provide accountability. That includes reporting the amount paid to DBVE's when measuring an agency's progress toward the agency's goals, requires effectiveness of outreach efforts to measure by number of new DVBE certified.
6882	McCarty	Kevin	22	3kFvJ6RqeLE	169	194	This has issues that we need to focus on related to what's happening at Berkeley and UCLA. Now it impacts other campuses throughout the system. This is an issue here that we wanna make sure we hear from not only the Committee Members, though we have some expert testimony form people who have studies this throughout the nation, who can enlighten us on the situation.
6883	Hernandez	Ed	103	CVBfShlBh9U	1038	1048	I believe Assembly member Maienschein, do you want Samara Brown to call you because you're last in the file. Do we go by file or he wants to call in you office or do you mind waiting or?
6884	Harper	Matthew	14	Z5dUcZuiBfw	645	662	Let me underscore; this does not benefit coastal clean-up, this does not go to any study that can show whether it's effective or not, this goes to the retailers. This higher fee comes at a time when the cost for meat, eggs, and other staples are rising.
6885	Leno	Mark	60	wlFflIxZr_U	520	541	So, your concern again, with the Trailer Bill language is that currently So-Cal Rock is not definitively excluded from the funding. It's just that they have to work more collaboratively with their consortium. Yep. All right. Local control funding formula implementation.
6886	Baker	Catharine	74	N6EhWxD1_nY	525	536	So I'm wondering two things. Why does this has to be so overbroad? Are you open to discussions about a more surgical strike on this so that we are being smarter about how we can protect consumers?
6887	Wagner	Donald	88	9mjyTPfbhPw	114	145	And they reference the Oregon case that Ms. Grove talked about. It is chilling. There are two patients. Beverly Wagner, no relation, and Mr. Stroop who was mentioned before, who were denied chemotherapy because that's expensive. And my friend from San Diego, speaking on healthcare, hit that nail squarely on the head, that's expensive. They were however,
6888	McCarty	Kevin	22	3kFvJ6RqeLE	223	250	The second to last issue I addressed was one thing we want to ask UC out of the gate, as far as if they can give us an update. As far of the $25 million that we put forward asking that the UC system to enroll 5,000 more California students, undergraduates and whats happening with that and in this post recession era we're looking to continue to reinvest in higher education. We've done so this year a little bit.
6889	Melendez	Melissa	41	rhQS6ToXbi0	486	509	Thank you Mr Chairman. Sir you. I'm a little confused about something because I'm reading in the analysis of the bill that there's, bless you, there's great concern that there's not a proper or fast enough response to rates of domestic and sexual violence.
6890	Hill	Jerry	66	gqFKPQ41Jk4	344	373	So I know it's probably frustrating as I can see, but how do we look at doing that and how can we track them better? How do you make sure that the letters are both accessible and how do you make sure the Commission orders do not inappropriately point rate decisions to advice letters that should be dealt with in the proceedings instead.
6891	Gomez	Jimmy	80	JgpqDSrKaXw	1227	1246	AB 12, Cooley, state government administrative regulation do pass. A roll call. AB 18, Dodd, NAPA Earthquake disaster relief do pass. A roll call. AB, Rodriguez, oil-by-rail spills training for firefighters do pass. A roll call. AB 418, prohibits pedestrian and bicycle towing on toll bridges do pass. B roll call.
6892	Hueso	Ben	48	uymj8kL8SYs	799	828	Unfortunately fire is, combating fire, is a very high priced item, very costly. It requires machinery that's very costly, requires manpower, very costly, people die fighting fires. And, we often try to put a price tag on that in this state. So I'm not going to support this motion today, but I will be interested in the outcome of the case.
6893	Garcia	Cristina	112	95pquWUVfBw	701	712	Maybe not simple at the conscience level that you want to talk about an issue that we need to deal with I don't want to dismiss that in any capacity but it is about choice not just what I do with my body.
6894	Chiu	David	7	UDPqIWouyOQ	681	697	A bill which would increase our state's affordable housing tax credit by $300 million for the construction and rehabilitation of affordable housing, which would also allow us to leverage $600 million in federal funds that would otherwise not come to California.
6895	Weber	Shirley	44	ZcJSZ4qEe4Y	1818	1830	I think the concept is very good, that we want people to have some awareness of it, but not having enough awareness of it, or enough skills, enough knowledge could backfire.
6896	Allen	Benjamin	70	U-gbn_qz8sg	605	626	I mean, how is it that, you know, you see that kind of capture of the share of a gallon of oil at the pump in such a short period of time when there doesn't seem-- when actually crude prices are dropping?
6897	Leno	Mark	60	Ezi_nx0zhx8	831	855	Excuse me. And I was just curious, if you can share with us some of the amendments that were proposed or that you may have considered, if there's a way to soften what has been expressed as a blow. Whether you get the opposition off of the bill or not, I think, it can at times, make it a better bill. I don't know what I'm talking about because you haven't shared them with us yet. But, I'm just curious.
6898	Pan	Richard	96	vjd6Y9hnzuc	683	701	So, I mean there's both the ongoing treatment and then there's also building surge, right, and sometimes surge is not recognized as being necessary until the disaster happens. But if you don't build the capacity, you're not going to create a pediatric bed in 24 or 36 hours.
6899	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	HgBIr1hupMw	678	692	Well, I think remembering that we actually did have this funding available prior to 2011, I would simply refer us all back to the success rates associated with that, particularly for our youngest children.
6900	Jones	Brian	42	Vrc3ih-DRQU	1527	1543	If I may encourage the author to either answer the question or in his close to walk us through the process as the bill is currently written, how a charter school can apply for these grants.
6901	Bonta	Rob	85	KcpO7Oo2ci0	638	648	Can we remind you, we're at name, organization, and position only. You've had two substantive witnesses that have gone beyond the six minutes of allotted time. So, please just state your name, organization, and position.
6902	Lara	Ricardo	107	6Q9j6EYWwEw	912	927	The capped enrollment program will establish a means to cover undocumented adults who are income-eligible for MediCal. Enrollment will be limited by the amount of funding made available through next year's budget.
6903	Melendez	Melissa	41	eQ53gxbhFGs	681	695	But this would also cover the smaller ones that maybe only can hold two passengers in the back. So does that mean that they would also have to have a safety monitor onboard or is that only?
6904	Hancock	Loni	98	0XEmXVzSg6Q	1154	1193	They would like the United States to do more to help the people that were damaged by agent orange and other things, but they want to move on. And I believe that it is worth having a day of reflection of the lessons of history so we are never forced to repeat them, but this resolution is not in the spirit of what my constituents I think would want me to vote for.
6905	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	bG49iSrqac0	449	485	Thank you Senator Bates. Senator McGuire? Is Senator McGuire here? We wish to take up your item at Senator De Leon's desk, no objection. Senator McGuire, at Senator De Leon's desk.
6906	Garcia	Eduardo	38	B_DlPPzaBGc	991	1014	In 1991, the conservancy was put together by the California State Legislature in order to preserve the biodiversity and the ecology of the Coachella Valley's areas. The two cities were not included due to the fact that they are on the floor of the Coachella Valley and not adjacent to any of the mountain ranges.
6907	Beall	Jim	92	W3V5gga6q1k	93	114	We have not increased the base revenues for this work since the 1990s. We no longer have the funding to maintain the infrastructure we have, let alone address the needs of ever-growing and shifting population. This bill requires a much needed funding plan to address the maintenance and backlog of our aging system.
6908	Bonta	Rob	85	Di5WyuYmeiA	502	519	I believe that current law states that a physician has complete, professional discretion over the writing of a medical exemption. However, I have asked the author to take an amendment to clarify that a medical exemption is entirely within the professional judgement of a physician and we have agreement on that amendment.
6909	Hernandez	Ed	103	omT12LxK-8I	261	288	Anyone else in support? Any opposition? And again, we have, are you in opposition? Yeah, we have a total of six minutes for the opposition. And after the six minutes, we'll just ask for your name and position only.
6910	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	mgHzB-qdttI	1262	1274	If we allowed this, this is a, a statutory prohibition that is long overdue to be enhanced, reformed, and modernized. We're in the 21st Century, let's act like it.  Mm-hm.  And, that's why we have this bill forward.
6911	Rendon	Anthony	120	OGSzGIXfLs8	200	214	In essence, I'm calling for challenges to PUC decisions to get their day in court, to talk to a judge about why the PUC decision was right or wrong. On the cost of the PUC, its fiscal estimate put the cost at 4.6 million.
6912	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	3F-MRhTliC4	784	808	I also rise in support of this initiative. As we see more girls entering into the fields of mathematics and engineering, it is clearly an exciting opportunity. And while we are seeing more young women enter the field and should be encouraging more and more to do so for the reasons that have been set forth.
6913	Lara	Ricardo	107	kyRwF6Xn7UY	1321	1333	Next moving on to Assemblymember Ting, AB 40, Toll bridges, pedestrians, and bicycle tolls, do pass to the Senate Floor. Substitute the role of AB 2, that bill's approved on a 5 to 2 vote with Republicans voting no.
6914	Hancock	Loni	98	bv9YSPFbNEk	760	772	No. It is 505 beds? I thought that by doing the fence, we would get a hundred and something beds. But if we're getting 505 more beds, that's even better.
6915	Chau	Ed	116	Vrc3ih-DRQU	1223	1245	Now as far as the definition of the schools being included, we are in the process of revising the definition to make it a more inclusive term or neutral term. The term that we've been toying with is the LEA, which is the Local Educational Agency, which will be more inclusive of all schools.
6916	Williams	Das	12	ohOGzwAGjR4	1273	1298	There's a reason, because price stability is itself a goal. And while we have been fortunate that natural gas prices are low right now, that has not always been the case. It nearly bankrupted this state. The volatility of, of natural gas prices, and the diversification of supply is always good for price stability.
6917	Wilk	Scott	19	-z6iX7gB4pQ	1400	1410	You know, we are the gateway to the Pacific, and I think we all know how we benefit from that economically. So, with that, I just appreciate your consideration and ask for an aye vote.
6918	Williams	Das	12	nZglKWPAZEc	0	15	I would even argue that citing that should exacerbate my point, not minimize it. I drive an electric car. My wife drives an electric car. I believe in electric cars.
6919	Hertzberg	Robert	99	sv9CTiV9bwA	1586	1607	the big capital issue, you guys, from my point of view, is we have to be smart about this, cuz every dollar we wanna put here doesn't mean we have money for foster care. Or for preschool, or for doctors, or whatever. And this seems to me to be something that's sustainable. If we really put our minds to it, to really solve a big problem, reduce costs to folks, clean up the environment,
6920	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	kmplgTQ8GXM	1398	1411	Decades ago the legislature agreed that non-academic staff at community colleges and school districts must be considered classified employees, however many workers in the state have been hired on a short term status year after year preventing them from
6921	Stone	Jeff	26	ho-PTBXT9zU	722	740	Thank you for your presentation, I appreciate it. I wasn't here when they were having the hearings on some of these more troubling instances where homes were using drugs as chemical restraints or punishments. That's not something that certainly, I condone, or I'm sure my colleagues condone.
6922	Bonilla	Susan	3	WgBOQU7UIHU	2184	2199	Just for clarification to the opposition in terms of the exemption of our state universities, it is my understanding they would not be exempt because they're already covered by section 504 of the Rehabilitation act which is a federal law.
6923	Chavez	Rocky	83	NULZ8SoEhtM	518	535	And I see that sort of discussion going on and now technology and all the great things you're doing, so I would, I'm happy to be a part of this. I think this is one bill we're moving forward and I expect to see many more with that positive view of making California what it should be. So, I'd please ask for your aye vote.
6924	Cannella	Anthony	61	2Dc5I9_7zFA	912	929	The nice thing about local government, if the local government's upset, they can hold people accountable and get rid of their council, or they can do whatever they need to do to remedy that. Versus a state law, then there's really no recourse. So I'm still concerned about the overflow into adjacent neighborhoods.
6925	Lara	Ricardo	107	qTf-RqJKEFo	203	220	SB 208 will apply only to projects where the grant is less than one million dollars. Additionally, this bill sunsets on January 1, 2025 to allow for the meaningful evaluation and assessment of the advance payment model.
6926	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	iOsHLGCzh8U	1609	1627	When you're prosecuting, I heard here, you may have enough evidence to quickly get something adjudicated as opposed to a long drawn-out trial which involves DA's time, prosecutor's time, I guess police review boards, commissions, legislative bodies' time, staff time.
6927	Hueso	Ben	48	Rj2lrXkjDIw	1467	1486	at a local government, I don't really have the pleasure of knowing the very broad menu of benefits we have given solar in the state and I support solar very much and I'd like to have more people in our community have solar. But I also support other renewables as well.
6928	De Leon	Kevin	102	GhElfEb6QxY	298	323	As well as, I believe, Zachary- that's a different department here. So we already have our statements. I just wanna very quickly is there anyone that you wanna introduce that you haven't had the opportunity to do so already? Yes. Okay, well, we're up to questions and commentaries with our members. Why don't we start off with Madame Vice Chair? Thank you so very much.
6929	Leno	Mark	60	Hfoe3X0tet8	835	846	Very good, and this may be a more appropriate question for its next committee, the appropriations committee, but, do we have an identified funding source for the proposed program?
6930	McGuire	Mike	93	j_YjnTPR-gU	1864	1877	But that's why I'm saying a 2018 implementation, because there are contracts that have already been placed by the majority of the rate payers in both Marin and Sonoma counties, and they need to let those contracts play out.
6931	McCarty	Kevin	22	XYWDulv6x4s	1418	1432	So that it's, it's well noted. We have a we have a list as far as things we're taking a look at as we get close to, to the, to the main revision. And this is certainly something that's on the list for consideration. So.
6932	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	0JpwnSkUZnE	2199	2213	What is it that makes you come back again and again? Cuz that's what we're finding whether it's housing, the formerly incarcerated. We have people that don't even wanna allow them to live in their place, even though they may have a great job and been working on it for a couple of years.
6933	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	Ve6b2OIjftM	443	458	Thank you for your testimony. Additional witnesses in support? Witnesses in opposition? Questions of the Committee? This enjoys a do pass recommendation. Mr. Perea, as amended, Mr. Perea has moved our second. Would you like to close?
6934	Stone	Mark	20	FA0o_dng1YE	1042	1055	Anyone else in opposition, or concerns, or otherwise? All right, I'm going to bring it back to the committee. And I'm sorry Mr Perea, I missed the beginning of it but I understood you're willing to take amendments two through seven...
6935	Hill	Jerry	66	qXgW2NUq_uc	1127	1137	So as you saw in the question that was raised, or the issue that was raised, is the BRN has not provided appropriate oversight of its continuing education program despite admonition to do so in previous reviews.
6936	Olsen	Kristin	15	-9yM4LrfOs0	565	608	Members, I have a niece with severe disabilities. I want her to be able to access all of our facilities and we work very hard toward that goal. But what's happening with the abuses of the ADA is not facilitating access for the disabled, it's simply lining the pockets of greedy plaintiffs and attorneys who have no interest in improving accessibility of our businesses, of our government facilities, of our schools and elsewhere. That's the issue we all have to figure out how to address together so we can increase accessibility in our communities but so that we can also protect small businesses from what's costing them thousands of dollars and, in many cases, shutting their doors altogether.
6937	Gaines	Beth	109	jcqm9XlDQYM	318	344	By requiring miners to obtain federal and state water quality permits, in addition to any permit required by Department of Fish and Wildlife could decimate any and all future recreational and small commercial dredge mining operations. These miners are not giant conglomerates who are polluting rivers, they are small-scale miners who are trying to make a living and feed their families.
6938	Mitchell	Holly	64	7Nve54D7sWM	1615	1642	While we're looking at, as we looked at in our joint hearing with Sub two, the loss of licensed childcare stock, if you will. My concern is that this would be another potential barrier to a stage one mom who's got a very limited amount of time to get her childcare situation straight before her aid runs out.
6939	Maienschein	Brian	84	UxH7e9-dweU	1160	1181	Thank you Mr. Chau. Any further questions or comments from the committee? Seeinh none, thank you ladies and gentlemen for your testimony here today. I'd like to open it up for public testimony if there's any members of the public who wish to address the committee, now is the time to do so.
6940	Pan	Richard	96	7GZ072NI9Sk	1514	1527	And unfortunately usually you don't have much warning when you do need it. So, there's more to do there. So, I just wanna again thank you all for your testimony and I appreciate you being here, and so, thank you so much.
6941	Chau	Ed	116	LnIRCPhjt4g	139	161	Got it. Now a follow up question to Miss Patterson, I think you talk about several recommendations. One of which was in regards to data collection, I think, which has been asked by two colleagues already. But just a clarification question, were you referring to the actual data collection, or the sharing of data within let's say, or amongst various agencies?
6942	Leno	Mark	60	Ea-UVDMoM1k	502	525	And then, not to dig into it at this point and I know there will be discussion on the floor tomorrow, but I don't think we can really look at the compromise budget completely without recognizing the two special sessions that the Governor has called for. One to look at our transportation needs for highways, roads, and bridges through
6943	Hertzberg	Robert	99	rEreViIPqP0	413	431	In every religion there's a time for sober reflection and a time for festive celebration. This, colleagues, is a time of jewish celebration. Today, Jews around the world celebrate the festival of Purim room and a festival it is. It is the most joyous of all Jewish holidays.
6944	Pan	Richard	96	qapPMGGQ0rI	1756	1777	I just also want to say that, in agreement with Senator Block that I think the fundamentals, there are probably some things that were brought up that I hope that you will work with the opposition in terms of some timelines, and so forth, but I think the basic thrust of the bill and the fundamental policies that are in here certainly in support.
6945	Bates	Pat	58	xDQm4xTXlMg	1151	1170	I guess I'm saying you're not providing a pathway. You're providing a hill to climb. And it has so many potholes, pitfalls, along the way. I just think that they say okay maybe some can make it but many won't so they're just going to eliminate those products.
6946	Mitchell	Holly	64	c3rIX9MpSXI	1084	1105	Excellent, so again, public client, and and admin and finances.  Okay, any public comment on trailer bill six o six, the continued suspension of performance and health insurance incentive payments?
6947	Weber	Shirley	44	9UYl1IR1e0U	65	84	I consistently find the great challenge with charters almost lying at the local level in terms of school boards not fulfilling their full responsibility. They have the responsibility to deal with the issue of making charters, they have the responsibility of evaluating charters, they have the responsibility of coming down on the issues that are important
6948	Patterson	Jim	119	-R4HGT4UbOs	1969	1993	But, Tark turned them into young men and into successful adults. To them, he was a mentor, a friend, and a father figure. He is remembered for his big wins, his sideline towel biting, and his winning record. But above all, members, he is fondly remembered for his caring character that changed so many young lives.
6949	Nguyen	Janet	65	bxDlgoZu0KI	1248	1260	It is also an economically rational decision for these families to keep one parent out of the work force to care for the child instead. In cases like these, it's usually the woman who becomes a stay at home mom and gives up her career.
6950	Block	Marty	59	75GgF4MuVHk	33	62	There are 10,000 Californians or tens of thousands of Californians who already see naturopathic doctors as their primary care physicians. Given the tremendous shortage of primary care doctors in California, it's especially important that we not unreasonably impose restrictions on those who are being seen as primary care doctors, as long as they can safely and effectively fulfill their scope.
6951	Dahle	Brian	47	E2p7xKQCT9g	459	494	I'm interested in this organic material is generated in the urban areas, but is needed in the rural areas where you can actually put it on rangeland. And has there been any studies on the transportation and how much carbon is used to transport the amount, we're talking millions of tons of organics. We did a study. Placer County, which I represent, did a study on biomass and wood chip waste. And we took into consideration the chipping operation.
6952	Low	Evan	11	ZHlQISHQoPg	1795	1810	So, I just want to, again, the distinction that I'm suggesting that we have a conversation about to see if you might be willing to take is, rather than looking at the increase from the previous year, the language would then read such as, "starting from 2017".
6953	Nielsen	Jim	68	kap3kcxQfYA	1785	1809	Infrastructure is critical and the Governor has focused on that. The voters have spoken on that with the passage of Proposition 1 and we need to get about these projects, not delaying them for literally decades. In very particular, that includes the storage the surface impoundments  and the groundwater replenishment that Prop 1 does provide for.
6954	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	jDtW4rS0Mqk	854	872	Thank you. LAO? No comment? Are there any questions from Committee members? We're going to vote on this but we need to ensure that Mr. Bigelow is added to the roll. Otherwise he doesn't exist.
6955	Alejo	Luis	9	fNO-vhR1Uas	1424	1451	For me, that was a real, sad statement that California could and should be doing better. So, that's why media wanted to try to set up this meeting to ask those questions. What can we be doing better? And as part of the Disaster Assistance Act Relief, what's a process for locals applying for that funding? And then how do you determine, or how does a community prove demonstrate the urgent need to get that funding?
6956	Nielsen	Jim	68	-R2gq2-ns5U	1635	1644	Every year, the agencies come in and they have a backlog, and they need more PYs, and every year they come back, the next year. And well, like well we need more PYs.
6957	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	Kc7udwSIfNk	1606	1628	Ayes 24 noes 15, the measure fails. Senator Mendoza asks for reconsideration. Reconsideration is granted. Ayes 40 noes 0. Is there any further business before this esteemed body this evening? Seeing and hearing none, Senator De Leon, the desk is clear.
6958	Gomez	Jimmy	80	0KJVRFCFgZY	1894	1920	Thank you so much. Questions or comments from the committee members? So I'm gonna make a comment. I was on Transportation, and I understand that there was an amendment that was asked from the committee chair. Although this isn't a policy committee, it's a fiscal committee, and I wanna make sure that, you understand that there might be opposition on the floor.
6959	Mullin	Kevin	31	oObwrA_56LI	290	304	Mr. Holden moves, Ms. Olson seconds that the reading of the previous day's journal be dispensed with. Presentations of petitions, there are none. Introduction and reference of bills will be deferred. Reports of committees will be deemed read and amendments deemed adopted.
6960	McCarty	Kevin	22	sx5Murt3em4	1681	1699	Here's some scenario as far as what could, could happen if the if the UC stepped up and agreed to the wholesale pension reform that the rest of the State of California has, has already agreed to.
6961	Weber	Shirley	44	1dDkNt95rgU	1180	1194	It is not our intent to have programs regress at all. In fact, the core programs will be, even though they won't exist as some look at them now, the programs will continue to exist, the services will still be provided in those areas.
6962	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	6RcHSaSd1rw	728	747	Colleagues, we're going to go till 12:30 at which point in time we will hear announcements about various committees that will be meeting during that luncheon recess such as it is. And then we'll be back on the floor. So we're going to continue now until 12:30 at which point we'll take the lunch recess with announcements
6963	Hernandez	Roger	37	4sq_B6zlasQ	1530	1547	Mr. Speaker I want to first and foremost thank my colleagues for their words of support words of encouragement and for those that see the world little differently I want to say thank you for your input as well. I know for the more conservative members here there's often an argument that we ought to allow local
6964	Nielsen	Jim	68	qIsKWbokTQE	1585	1607	Thank you Mr. Keller. Okay.  Supporting the boss.  Very good. Senator Nguyen, any questions that you may have to offer today? And you have moved the bill, Senator Ross, so I trust that you're in support.
6965	Weber	Shirley	44	1dDkNt95rgU	1194	1209	There'll be greater resources to help them coordinate what they're doing with the existing structure that's coming into place to basically coordinate the Foster Youth Services in a way that enhances the six areas in which they exist.
6966	Wolk	Lois	94	rTtHKpIYZjo	1118	1170	Let's go to Prop 1 for a moment. Of this chart on page 4, there are some of these programs that are brand new. So, there's no record, there's no anything other than the direction in the bond. Do you think it would make any sense, any rational sense, to distinguish between those in terms of getting some money out the door quickly, which is the intent of the administration, to distinguish between those that are brand new programs, and therefore require a great deal of regulation and formation of guidelines, etc. versus existing programs that we know are working and that have a backlog perhaps?
6967	Nguyen	Janet	65	bxDlgoZu0KI	1260	1273	The financial burden of children, of child, of childcare becomes more of a reality for family I'm describing, especially living in an urban area, such as Orange County, Los Angeles, San Diego, or even San Francisco.
6968	Leno	Mark	60	uk0vIxtVZmg	674	687	So noted. Thank you. Thank you, sir. So thank you, colleagues. I'm going to ask a few more questions in response to some of the comments made in public comment, and again, I'm just trying to get as much of this aired as possible.
6969	Wieckowski	Bob	55	scqfU4UsUAo	1723	1735	First off I would like to thank the committee for its work and say that I'm taking its authors amendments that are noted in the analysis. The homestead exemption will be reduced from 300 or 700,000 to 300,000.
6970	Nguyen	Janet	65	gDPCmEU7pmg	424	436	Well that's kind of, I'm sorry, then to me that's a wrong definition. You can't say that these two public members are from affected areas when they aren't because I mean if its like I just said.
6971	Leno	Mark	60	KNTNNHrdr9E	1650	1662	Alright. So, we have already voted on this before. We have a motion by Senator Pan. We have discussed this, other opportunities, any public comment? I don't see any. Call the roll, please.
6972	Gomez	Jimmy	80	-Nb5xJu_Rq4	495	512	Thank you so much any other questions? Comments from committee members? If not, this bill is out on a B roll call. Thank you so much, Mr. O'Donnell. Mr. Dodd, you're up.
6973	Bloom	Richard	2	jj5fwuuTvrg	711	735	after having not ridden on a skateboard for a while decided he was going to and the next thing he knew he was in the emergency room with what turned out to be a very compound, complex fracture that resulted in a rod being placed in his arm, and it was a very serious accident. These things do happen.
6974	Leno	Mark	60	LFikd5rYakY	2087	2123	Only that give it to you in just a minute Senator. And, for any Senator who doesn't have this and would like one, we will get...please have copies. Only those things that are italicized are in the bill that we're voting on today. Otherwise that which is not italicized, we've already voted on and it was already approved. So only the changes that we're voting on are italicized.
6975	Chau	Ed	116	2Dc5I9_7zFA	1080	1097	And one thing that I also want to bring up is the fact that yes, they do have the ability to negotiate with the developer on lowering the parking standards. But I think the standards are so stringent that the hands of the developers are being tied oftentimes.
6976	Gatto	Mike	46	kAZMIWno7zI	1496	1513	A whole other category, of course, would be the government monitoring that. Which of course is the first category talked about which is the relationship of government and, how it treats its citizens in terms of privacy. and then of course the third category which mentioned is this citizen to citizen privacy issue.
6977	Pan	Richard	96	h3qpDny4S5o	837	853	What is the department going to do to address the issue of an accurate directory and what's a timeline for fixing this directory so that it's actually something that we can  actually respect and feel confident that the information we have is accurate.
6978	Bonta	Rob	85	oZrbKv34-B8	1088	1106	Our read of that language is or of the case law is that bans, by local jurisdictions are lawful and that they do not violate the compassionate use act. So that's one of the genesis of our current approach.
6979	Nguyen	Janet	65	fUpA9iRHn2E	118	156	Just real quick, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. I just want to take this opportunity, again, to thank you for holding this hearing and to fulfill your commitment with our former colleague, Senator Mimi Walters. At it's core, the provider moratorium issue touches on several areas that I care deeply about. One, ensuring Medi-Cal beneficiaries have a robust network of providers. Two,  protecting taxpayers dollars by rooting out fraud from public programs, and also maximize opportunities for California businesses. So I'm very excited. This is the next step in improving upon those status quo, and I look for to the testimony. Again, thank you for the opportunity.
6980	Mullin	Kevin	31	tI-QOGtgDxM	1161	1191	Mr. Bonta moves the call. Members, we are awaiting the Senate to take action on Assembly bills. We are waiting for the Senate to take action on Assembly bills. Members, we are going to take a one-hour recess.
6981	McGuire	Mike	93	-1v9avmnxCY	1289	1303	That said, we've been able to build more affordable housing per capita than any other city in the county, and we've been able to negotiate reductions in parking every time, allowing for on street parking as well.
6982	Melendez	Melissa	41	mNQQzzy6ePQ	53	73	Considering that the average cost of a handgun in California is $495, a traditional rifle is $625, and a shotgun is $880, I am sure that's information that you're so happy to have Mr. Chairman, it is clear that the current law is and will be ineffective in curtailing gun theft.
6983	McGuire	Mike	93	u0-ac-4sGAg	1864	1874	In closing, the regulations and programs continue to spill a nearly a nearly two decades overdue. and I look forward to working with you, Mr. Chair, and the appropriations committee with this bill as it remains on suspense.
6984	Bonilla	Susan	3	o1G7aqM68SE	86	100	So how do we account for such a dramatic regional difference? And then these numbers really were as a result of the practical examination being recalibrated. Not the written.
6985	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	Y6LWzDb2ask	666	707	So earlier this year, roughly 2000 people gather that the Leobeck Temple which is, for those of you who know the Los Angeles area, across the street from the Getty Museum. That is in the spoke of the past and it was packed out. It was multigenerational and it was multi-ethnic and interreligious because this man truly was a dynamic Californian reaching the various facets of life. Los Angeles this state this nation are better for the life of rabbi Leonard Bierman. Thank you Mr speaker.
6986	Beall	Jim	92	ckv1hzYbS0w	1762	1787	That money would really accelerate, you know, clean buses in the transit industry. And, transit industry buses wear out pretty fast. So they need to replace those buses.  They all say that to me, they're scream at me all the time. Okay, so, I just thought I'd ask that question.

6990	Mitchell	Holly	64	HebbT5qrJn8	931	938	Well, we thank you for coming in and representing really all of Californians sharing your perspective, so thank you for coming today. Thank you very much, you have a nice day.
6991	Mendoza	Tony	52	E1_HgghcmCU	942	957	Okay, so why can't you do an app that when they're logged on, they're paying commercial rates for plates, you have to pay commercial rates for plates. For the time that they're logging off for those two or three days, or two and three hours, whatever, two or three days in a row, similar to what you're paying for insurance.
6992	Stone	Jeff	26	TrPgAQvjTc0	782	799	We already are well on the way to reducing greenhouse gases through card dictated policies emission reductions that occurred through that there's the recent economic downturn should be considered before adopting any future greenhouse gas limits and those reduction should be based on missions not estimates derive from computer modeling.
6993	Frazier	Jim	114	z7GYIGDOm-s	1046	1065	Mr. Chair and Committee Members. Thank you for the opportunity to present AB 345. Current law requires a real estate broker to exercise reasonable supervision over the activities of his or her salespersons. AB 345 would earmark, three hours of real estate broker's existing continuing education for
6994	Block	Marty	59	m_1fhqTgwb8	167	188	Yeah, thank you Senator Liu, in plain English I thank everybody in this room and both sides of the aisle. All the departments represented. Third house folks, people in the Assembly as well as the Senate, we all agree that kids deserve a safe place to learn, a clean place, a comfortable place, a place that's conducive to learning.
6995	Weber	Shirley	44	_YWoRdtfoP8	990	997	That all of our training and staff development and resources we're going to put in PAR and we're looking at PAR in the budget to be very honest with you.

SB 499 is not designed to punish teachers instead it establishes a system to evaluate all teachers in a fair and transparent manner with the goal of providing continuous improvement
6997	Gatto	Mike	46	M5Sfl5zR2ew	821	840	The second point is that there is a State Database. It's my understanding that there is a State Database that has the samples which are coded with the number matched up to a name. And the reason why is because there's a small subset of parents, right now, who object to the storage and they're informed enough to go and object.
6998	Wieckowski	Bob	55	JX3K3k4qzkE	582	594	Okay, so I'm thinking that I'm the healing arts person, right. So, you want me when I come in there and I'm looking to be healed and they do something and help me.
6999	Huff	Bob	105	YcUHbu4AhVs	735	761	I'd just like to say I'm, I guess, a dying breed. I was able to get through college in four years, and I see the value of doing that getting in the workplace, being productive soon, and I do think this bill is past due, where we express our commitment as a state government to helping those kids that are ready that have the time, the ability, the desire to get through quickly. I think we should facilitate that, and so I gladly support the bill. Thank you.
7000	Cooley	Ken	45	fB7TsGCipRU	504	518	Yeah, to respond Mr. Woods, I think our job is to figure out what policy makes sense, and so when someone has been flaunting the policy I think it's fair to ask the, to structure it to take account of that.
7001	Hueso	Ben	48	-IqFWVcq77k	1031	1046	And in a civil matter I have to agree with you, right. I have to agree with you in a civil matter. But I'm specifically asking about a criminal matter. There's a very big distinction between a criminal matter and a civil matter.
7002	Hernandez	Ed	103	JM1ztwrhmks	1540	1553	So you had mentioned that the way you price it is not for the cost of the development, which, that's kind of counter what I've heard to other pharmaceutical manufacturers because there's a certain cost of development.
7003	Mitchell	Holly	64	cxFa18iFwgA	3	46	Moving on to item 4300, the Department of Developmental Services, DDS. We're going to start with the department overview. We've got thirteen issues in this section. We'll start with department overview, then we'll proceed on to regional center operations, regional center purchase of services. Again, public testimony coming at the end of this section of the agenda. Welcome Mr Rogers.
7004	McGuire	Mike	93	nKjAvt3bj9Q	738	762	Absolutely. We're grateful and that is our goal here today. So we're so appreciate you being here.  Thank you. It is now my pleasure to be able to introduce Mrs. Iris Hoffmann. She is from Sonoma County and is a member of the California Youth Connection and we're grateful that you've traveled here today and it's good to see you. Thank you so much.
7005	Jones	Brian	42	-OpN4Uo7BxE	1862	1872	But sometimes rights have to be protected, and in protecting those rights, we have to make sure that people those who are supposed to be voting are the ones voting.
7006	Brown	Cheryl	13	m4SYy4oYAnU	1883	1895	Well I appreciate the suggestion and we'd be happy by the way to speak with you offline but I don't know the individual circumstances you're referring to. I'd like to know what that is as I say we're always going to be happy to engage directly and see what we can do to be helpful in
7007	Anderson	Joel	57	j1Gi-ueVYBU	307	327	I'm on track with what you're doing but I'm just wondering if we're using a sledgehammer on the fly because I'm concerned... what if I take that drone and I fly up, 100 feet up?
7008	Hill	Jerry	66	qXgW2NUq_uc	227	234	Certainly where you work is probably a great influence, but we're talking about elsewhere in the state where it may not be. And people won't recognize that, so that's what we're hoping that we can see from this board.
7009	Chavez	Rocky	83	TbimRTTdSU4	1071	1084	And there are examples of abuse, there's major corporations, some big company will take a veteran, have them put them on the title, and the person stays home, doesn't do any work, and the company's running forward.
7010	Leno	Mark	60	mkixEOc2Tj4	69	83	And just to get our definitions clear from the start, according to the FDA, e-cigarettes are battery operated products designed to deliver nicotine flavor, and other chemicals to the user.
7011	De Leon	Kevin	102	tF8-OuIBF-8	334	346	So we're gonna go to those who are in support of your nomination, then we'll go to those who are in opposition to the nomination, then we'll go to those who are tweeners, if you will.
7012	Pan	Richard	96	8xCr-TQCYCc	400	417	or many people are state employees, but also people may be interested in seeking careers with the state because it's right here in town, they don't have to move. We wanna be sure we work with CalHR and GovOps and figuring out how we can do that kind of outreach and particularly be sure we can attract diversity.
7013	Gomez	Jimmy	80	QXW5aikdMmE	876	891	AB 626, Low, entries community college full time and part time faculty ratios, due pass with amendments, striking reallocation provisions as said, requiring a stakeholder group to prepare a plan to meet the 75/25 goal and report to the legislature. B roll call.
7014	Baker	Catharine	74	uuwAxYppIw8	679	693	In fairness, Mr. Chairman, we were advised to stay in the committee room. But I thank the Chairman for trying to reach an agreement with Miss Weber, who's working very hard on this issue. And look forward to the vote.
7015	Frazier	Jim	114	gCJqYiGvi7w	1829	1843	Thank you Mr. Low. I do have a motion from Mr. Linder and a second Ms. Kim. Again, thank you Mr. Low. I understand we need to work on updating our existing laws and regulations to address that advancement in technology.
7016	Gallagher	James	108	RK37B-MMwt0	537	547	It is not a repossessor's role to act as a facilitator between the creditor and the debtor by taking money from the debtor in lieu of repossessing a vehicle. So this cleans that up.
7017	Irwin	Jacqui	16	tae4cv2hHsk	1105	1114	In the world of cyber security, we are only as strong as our weakest link. And here with me today, is Colonel Darrin Bender, from the California Military Department.
7018	Mitchell	Holly	64	x27zeIsX5Rs	1368	1382	Fact because and that's based on our belief that DHCS is using the assumption that all of the three counties that have interest will apply and fails to account for it's own phased in approach.
7019	Ting	Philip	30	mKpc_b2HFII	1181	1196	I know that always good things come out of dialogue and continue to debate and discuss issues, and I hope that we can continue to do that and hopefully find a path forward for all of us. Thank you very much.
7020	Perea	Henry	33	kQ8roglP29M	1043	1059	And so, I think as I look at the definition of the CalEnviroScreen, obviously, it's a definition that I support because, I think, it helps direct funds into communities that have been neglected in this debate for a very long time.
7021	Hertzberg	Robert	99	AO5QavLO0SY	1198	1213	with respect to the whole system of fines that adversely impact poor people, because we've made decision after decision in these budget cuts that fundamentally affect people's lives, such that what we learned here is 4.6 million
7022	Hueso	Ben	48	GHyOxyKfubI	788	796	And the device states that, it sounds like it tells you a lot. When you're using it, so it reminds you to call 911. So it's part of the process.
7023	Hertzberg	Robert	99	AO5QavLO0SY	1179	1198	they're going to pay their ticket and now they have a failure to appear. It's a legitimate excuse that they have an opportunity to present to a judge to make a determination as to whether or not the fine should be imposed. This measure says give those people access to justice to have their case heard. This is one of many steps that we're going to take
7024	Beall	Jim	92	qM5DAHMb8ig	1628	1650	It seems like, it seems like when people say it costs this much money, on the other hand, it saves a lot of money. I think it's fair, we have to have that number. When I looked at the report, I needed to see that, okay, and I, we need to do a little more explaining on that, I think, in the, in this.
7025	Garcia	Cristina	112	nQyRqNn-8MI	1143	1166	So I think that while it doesn't say that we will by default get that information and get to make that decision when this comes before us in 2017. I don't see the issue of it being clearly in there and it is a decision we will have to make at that point of it there's a cost and maybe this alternative funding out there.
7026	Hadley	David	40	OVIQdDmHNzI	1859	1879	We had an oil spill last month, we are learning in real time about how we can improve our processes and improve our procedures. And so taking a vehicle and amending it, and working in real time to do that strikes me as a great use of that legislative opportunity.
7027	Stone	Jeff	26	UgxxQ29DDfk	151	156	So the workers are in the counties. Then I guess I understand that the $5 million that you are requesting, you would like to have distributed to all the counties? Not to be used for...
7028	Hernandez	Ed	103	8_WRsqziEsc	259	281	I do commend the work you do cuz I know you've done a lot of work with reaching out to the community, community health centers, the county, the county systems. You know, all the different non-profits, and it seemed like it would be difficult to get access to specialty care. So when you do have access and you pay fee for service, do you pay at Medicare rate or do you pay above Medicare rate, or do you pay at market rate?
7029	Bonta	Rob	85	rLEgt6RVkfo	54	73	A mock up of the amendments is being passed out, thank you. The amendments are a result of technical assistance provided by the administration. The authors commit to working further with them and stakeholders, if the measure moves forward today out of this committee. AB 339 is driven by two fundamental consumer protections.
7030	Liu	Carol	63	6ril8VUEbBs	519	549	The community schools strategy is a nationally recognized approach for organizing the resources of the community around student success. It is both a place and a set of partnerships among the school and other community resources. Its integrated focus on academic, health, and social services. Youth and community engagement leads to improved student learning, stronger families, And healthier communities and I ask for your support on the bill. And I have witnesses that will testify.
7031	Nguyen	Janet	65	g1KhSxf2FKA	366	386	So now we're going state wide imposing on LA County on something that their voters do not want. Why can't we allow each of the counties to do their own ballot initiative individually? I'm just saying, you know, the voters don't want it, so.
7032	Hill	Jerry	66	zqM_Vy0kspE	784	805	Thank you Mr. Chair. I guess, and Mr. Malan you mentioned that, you know, Mobil says this is a good product and you don't have to change your oil, but if I drive a Toyota and it says I have to change it every 4000, and my warranty is conditioned on changing that, that I can show them when something goes wrong that I followed the manufacturer's recommendations, how does this apply to that?
7033	Hill	Jerry	66	JioAmr_hdxo	1691	1699	Thank you Mr. Chair. One question, and first Mr. Wetch, thank you I thought that was a great testimony and I think your point at the end is well-taken, and
7034	Pavley	Fran	104	aMmnutMx8lk	1423	1439	Okay, we'll wait to see if there are questions. Let's hear from anyone who just wants to add on the me too, and then I'm gonna open up for questions and we're gonna hear opposition. This is the support me too list.
7035	Alejo	Luis	9	KEeiqVKf9vU	150	165	Members, this is a bill that will once again provide critical and necessary tool for economic development and affordable housing for economically disadvantaged communities. This bill stays true to the original intent of redevelopment, which is to help those communities most in need.
7036	Rodriguez	Freddie	69	VkWyifymNDY	887	896	Today's hearing is a good start. We have received some good advice and we hope to make changes to the system to get there where we need to be.
7037	Bloom	Richard	2	LfirS3-TAVM	2037	2063	Thank you, Mr. Chair. You know, we're-- we have so many things to be thankful for and proud of here in the State of California but the fact that nearly one in five of our nation's homeless live in California is not amongst them. This bill is a number of small steps forward. The bill that you voted on passed out of the committee earlier as another step forward and I urge your vote, your aye vote.
7038	Achadjian	K.H. "Katcho"	5	Qd8yv7EufE4	1386	1400	For youngsters, the first discount you get when you get to be age 19 and you haven't had any tickets, it applies. Anyone else? Mr. Frazier, thank you. Mr. Nazarian?
7039	Gallagher	James	108	_YQzP7dcJFI	651	677	There's a friend of ours here in Sacramento that we all love and cherish who told me that his irish father would often say, "Don't care lick what they say about you. Just make sure they don't stop talking about you." We have a temper is true, but it's because we're passionate.
7040	Chavez	Rocky	83	7bdBeI04iMY	489	504	I know that this year's been very troubling for a lot of Americans seeing what's going across the country as far as policing. But, I think the issue is more of an issue of leadership and
7041	Garcia	Eduardo	38	aAhB2ce4YDU	416	430	I'll just in closing, thank again your committee staff and the conversation here.  AB 1097 is accepting the, the recommendations made by the committee staff, and I look forward to your aye votes.
7042	Campos	Nora	76	Y_NLzMPyU6M	564	621	Assemblymember Nazarian, I also want to say thank you for bringing this forward. I know that there have been attempts to move this forward in the past and it hasn't been successful at the Governor's desk, but I think as we continue to see our population age and they're living with us longer that we need to make sure that they're safe as well as when we have young individuals that may wander away from their parent and we're able to provide an avenue to recover our children. The other thing that I hope that we're also mindful of is that as we continue to put out different alerts that we need to think about how we distinguish which alerts are catching the eye of the person driving.
7043	Quirk	Bill	23	RplCDWdFT8I	1163	1182	Well, the bill, there's a lot of things that are up in the air right now. For example, can a drone fly over private property without a warrant? This bill says that you cannot do that. You need a warrant to go over private property. And that's not in any state law.
7044	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	Oggr1OKYFzQ	1882	1901	because that can be an issue I think you're on the right track, I'm gonna support the bill. But I would ask you to please try to work out some of the kinks, keeping in mind that what you're trying to accomplish and I think that you can get there and there may be some tweaks. So there is Senator Anderson and then we'll ask you to close very briefly and call the roll.
7045	Chau	Ed	116	csda2pMKJRU	174	193	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I, I just, I'll be supporting the bill today. However, I do have some concerns still, two of which, actually, we talked about last night. And, and I will observe my right to change my vote this next time I vote on it, but I do encourage you to continue working with the opposition. Thank you very much.
7046	Hadley	David	40	_Z7ChiMRbIg	454	471	Mr. Gordon, thank you for bringing the bill forward. My biggest reservation about the bill, as one of the witnesses mentioned, is that it's hard to view this as a pilot program, given the scope and the duration of the program.
7047	Stone	Jeff	26	nfRac3nHOas	1339	1348	But I think if you're going to have a true measure of the success of this program when you look at recidivism and each respective county and what it was pre-AB 109 and post-AB 109...
7048	McCarty	Kevin	22	Bt_iuqXFo8w	1011	1030	But on this education level I think this is appropriate to think as the Chair said, his fingerprints are left all over the education system. And we have many challenges in California with our education finance system, but without his work we would have much more problems ahead.
7049	Leno	Mark	60	8TJNuTDd7yI	735	751	To again, let consumers know whether or not these products have flame retardants in them. Let the consumer make up his or her own mind. The enforcement of the bill has been modeled on the previous bill, to build on existing procedures to keep costs down.
7050	Weber	Shirley	44	9UYl1IR1e0U	440	456	And any one person without due process is one too many, and for me so as a result of that, in fairness to the students, I'm supporting the bill because obviously there is an issue, it is a concern, but it should have been addressed at the local level. And that's my ongoing challenge.
7051	Hertzberg	Robert	99	wxAms1gWFJA	335	358	 I mean-- Look, I mean I did three of these bonds over the years and know it pretty well. But you really are telling me that after spending-- what, how much money do you guys spend over the last 12 years like $30 billion between what the state gave you in addition to aging infrastructure, I get that the building industry wants this because they need it to deal with their issues.
7052	Dababneh	Matthew	50	ROiUoxqGjEc	989	1004	Good after noon, Mr. Chair and members of the committee I'm here today to present AB 1358, which is, thank you, which is a straightforward bill to authorize and extend design build authority for school districts and products over $1 million until the year 2025.
7053	Kim	Young	82	P8Zs2L1mwlY	131	143	By admitting more nonresident students, we are doing at the expense of our resident students, and we're talking about giving accessibility for resident students and by doing, I mean, there's gotta be a cap here.
7054	Wood	Jim	72	X-EMNVy0KVE	46	60	This issue, this issue is especially magnified in rural districts such as mine. Non-medical transportation is defined as transportation of members to medical services by passenger car, taxi cabs, or other forms of public or private transportation.
7055	Pan	Richard	96	AGRN7-GFw2A	1500	1515	Unfortunately it's become an increasingly common practice for companies to pressure local agencies to provide a sales tax revenue rebate on the promise to book all sales from multiple sites with that local agency. Move the Bill Thank you.
7056	Hertzberg	Robert	99	Q93W3yN07bU	471	484	But this is different, because the records that are going to be either on the internet, whichis question I have, but so you gotta make the request, somebody's got to make the request, and it gives police a complete road map to get there.
7057	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	8rXIFmMWl08	243	262	Thank you, Mr. Gomez. Let me just make a comment before we proceed. This bill has been double referred to the Judiciary Committee. We will limit debate in this Committee to issues relating to education, and leave the other issues to the Judiciary Committee to debate, which it would then proceed on to, should it pass this Committee.
7058	Harper	Matthew	14	Z5dUcZuiBfw	1721	1735	Thank you. While I understand that some people would not like to reopen this argument and be able to examine this bargain that was made by the Legislature in the previous session, the reality is the voters have spoken and the voters do want us to re-discuss this issue and do want us to re-examine this issue.
7059	Cooley	Ken	45	CToLtc1eO8I	1665	1694	It's bring me men, bring me people to match my mountains. You know, early Californians came here by wagon. They had to come over this mountain range here to the east. And on the other side it's like a rock wall. And so that message says that what California we're looking for is people who can see a challenge in front of them, can decide nothing is going to stop me from getting over that obstacle.
7060	Levine	Marc	8	jKVkIx_af_k	913	926	Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. AB 761 establishes a framework to evaluate the potential for using best management practices on agricultural lands, ranches, and range lands to increase carbon sequestration and water retention.
7061	Burke	Autumn	6	R5jZe-4pYBI	380	400	The certified nurse midwife would just work under supervision of the hospital, which chances are their bylaws would require anyway. That's why in their particular bill this wasn't the pill that in, so many other situations it is to swallow because by design, most hospital bylaws require them to work under supervision.
7062	Dababneh	Matthew	50	6G5U2kPEBw0	26	64	When we swipe our card or wave our smart phone to make a purchase multiple entities are involved in the transaction with data traveling between the merchant payment networks, payment processor, issuing bank and acquiring bank. In seconds data travels between these entities, yet we rarely step back to look at what really goes into the system. Today we will attempt to remove the mystery from this process and shed some light on the changes that are happening rapidly in our economy. These issues are not just important for policy-makers to consider, as they have a direct impact on our economy, but also for consumers and the people that use this technology everyday.
7063	Ting	Philip	30	UxH7e9-dweU	611	630	K, great thank you (mumbles). I had question for Mr. Arevalo and Ms. Louie. You mentioned at this point, that you don't, you haven't legalized home sharing or Airbnb. I was curious regarding whether you're doing any particular kind of enforcement at this time.
7064	Quirk	Bill	23	1fxZCVj9XoA	420	438	Alright and Mr. Garcia. I think... Oh here we go. Here we have Assemblymember Eduardo Garcia on item number eighteen AB 832. Are you ready? Alright and Mr. Garcia. I think... Oh here we go. Here we have Assemblymember Eduardo Garcia on item number eighteen AB 832. Are you ready? Alright and Mr. Garcia. I think... Oh here we go. Here we have Assemblymember Eduardo Garcia on item number eighteen AB 832. Are you ready? Alright and Mr. Garcia. I think... Oh here we go. Here we have Assemblymember Eduardo Garcia on item number eighteen AB 832. Are you ready? Alright and Mr. Garcia. I think... Oh here we go. Here we have Assemblymember Eduardo Garcia on item number eighteen AB 832. Are you ready?
7065	Bonilla	Susan	3	6dKd_uGq3Mo	1713	1728	Yes, we have been talking about the issue of fees for the last couple of years with the Dental Board. And one reason there's such a significant increase, there weren't adequate increases in the past, and that needs to be addressed.
7066	Leno	Mark	60	SdYdT8y72Ng	1809	1834	Miss Chu, is it accurate to suggest and I know you did say you supported the trailer bill language with some modifications. But that maybe this suggestion notwithstanding Ms. Bosler's recent comments is just a little premature that we might give the LCFF another year or two to see if in fact we are gathering this information sufficiently and don't really need this additional?
7067	Allen	Travis	43	AW7ZOJRT_Sc	267	281	Also most plastic products whether high-performance durable plastics or commodity disposal plastics must meet tight performance standards. And to address these high-performance standards new plastic raw materials been developed over the past few decades.
7068	McGuire	Mike	93	zWP9Ch_UvEs	959	977	All this proposed legislation would do is make online vacation rental businesses follow local laws, many of which have been on the books for decades that have already been adopted by your city council or your board of supervisors.
7069	Monning	Bill	25	6yZuBCspGoA	16	37	Thank you, Mr. Chair and members. I'm here to present Senate Bill 344. Currently, when someone wants to drive a large truck, passenger bus, or other commercial vehicle in California, they must obtain a commercial driver's license, or CDL, by simply passing a DMV written and driving test.
7070	Wood	Jim	72	ASNmI2rHU9I	1558	1571	In the end, patients and providers are caught in the middle of a battle of titans on both sides. Patients who may struggle to get medications that could save their lives, or, or, dramatically improve their lives.
7071	Daly	Tom	118	f0azg54_KEY	317	329	Authorize the Board of Barbering and Cosmetology under the Department of Consumer Affairs to enforce the provisions of this bill and to take appropriate enforcement actions against an establishment that violates the provisions of the bill.
7072	Mitchell	Holly	64	oc8zggZcgHM	1305	1323	What he's trying to figure out how is how we can move fifty-eight county social services agencies to work together with our work force board at the regional level and our community colleges to connect those participants to those to those very pathways.
7073	Dahle	Brian	47	goLRzsDXvfE	933	944	Finally, the amendments stipulate that the provisions of AB 219 will only apply to public works contracts which are advertised or awarded for bid after this bill is enacted. I respectfully request your Aye vote.
7074	Berryhill	Tom	54	GnxGwd8ZNfU	804	834	I'd be remiss if I didn't have a few, huh? I too want to thank everybody for coming out here today and look forward to a robust discussion on how we might make a kind of a broken system a little bit better. The Chairman has a good point when she talks about the amount of kids that are falling below the poverty level, and it is something that I think, even though we may have different ways of solving this problem between the parties, I think we all have their best interests in mind.
7075	Garcia	Eduardo	38	tDRy7O_NObM	664	674	The last panel we will be hearing directly from small businesses. As the committee knows, the economic strength of California is highly dependent on the strength of our small businesses.
7076	McCarty	Kevin	22	GE9yKeDoFKQ	1844	1853	Certainly there's a priority in our state budget. We have over $300 million to expanding early learning programs, including a little bit over $100 million to expand the state preschool program.
7077	Cooley	Ken	45	kLTY4thtXsA	633	651	Yeah, I actually feel that, I think your points are well taken. I think this is an issue that actually, it's all of us have an opportunity here to put something together this year. I think we are grateful for longer term limits, but the fact is those years will flash by.
7078	De Leon	Kevin	102	A5ksLI96f9Q	1516	1535	I wouldn't blame Richard, I wouldn't blame him at all. So with that I've looked over, I'm familiar obviously with your, I'm familiar obviously with your background and your work. I'm satisfied that you'll do a very fine job. Why don't we entertain a motion? We have a motion made by Ms. Leyva. Madam Secretary, please call the roll.
7079	Leno	Mark	60	XQwWN6GsS_M	1438	1450	With one oversight, how could we not have one last oversight? Colleagues, just with regard to the first vote of the package. Without objection we're gonna resend that just so I can pull out page 25.
7080	Fuller	Jean	49	sO-5THRTetI	560	568	And she came and I told her, you need to do this because you'll be an assistant superintendent, and now she is an assistant superintendent, and I'm hoping some day she sits here on this Senate seat.
7081	Wieckowski	Bob	55	QmHhObaXRjg	1518	1534	That's saying this is a way that we change behaviors in the people in California that somehow don't get it and are not doing their fair share to tackle this emergency we have. I appreciate your indulgence, each and every one of you. I shall return.
7082	Nielsen	Jim	68	kmqs1i5uyec	1662	1680	I'd inquire, maybe staff know, is there a requirement that you have to report to the Legislature each year on your backlog reduction? Some agencies with backlog are required to report their backlog reduction each year. Is a requirement or do you know that?
7083	Bates	Pat	58	TSE2ocY_LpM	424	441	There's been a lot of issues raised and much of them are policy. So we're looking at the finances. I think the financial implications for school districts are huge and I'm wondering, Chairman, why we aren't asking this to go to suspense so we can take a deeper look at that.
7084	De Leon	Kevin	102	q7JaQd-cxG0	29	42	Fantastic. We've established a quorum. Colleagues, we're going to start off with the agenda. We're going to start off with file item number one, which is bill referrals to the committees. Can I get a motion?
7085	Hueso	Ben	48	uymj8kL8SYs	718	741	In San Diego in particular, you know, we have devastating fires out there. I would like to see the county implement a more robust program. We go out there into the areas that have the highest incidence of fires and find that we have the lowest budgets to provide fire protection.
7086	Beall	Jim	92	1-lHMg2FsZ4	1319	1342	Secondly, my bill includes protections to ensure that funding goes only to road maintenance. Third, it establishes efficiencies in CalTrans to ensure projects are completed on time and on budget. Finally, my bill provides funding at the state, county and city level to address road maintenance needs at all levels.
7087	Cooley	Ken	45	nRbBrM7qbgo	2	21	So that's one to bird dog on. If you can follow up with Amanda and I on that, because I'm not familiar with that, Roger. That would seem to be an urgent thing to kind of understand where we are at as we go through the budget process the next couple of weeks. Just to be supportive of that.
7088	Moorlach	John	4657	898OiW72jWg	2079	2098	Thank you, Mr.Chair, I appreciate my first experience in your graciousness to me. I'll always be there. You're a class act. For me, it's a marketing concern. We're gonna be asking the tax payers for another tax increase.
7089	Levine	Marc	8	hTPaXL_VY8w	1223	1233	Yeah, well, thank you Miss Weber and Miss Huffman for your, for your testimony and Ms. Weber for the bill. Totally support it. It's really important that we work harder on this.
7090	Levine	Marc	8	KTS25NPAjyE	434	449	We estimate that there are at least 1,150 Californians that are at risk for being denied an organ transplant due to their cannabis use. Too often patients are denied a life saving organ transplant solely because they're prescribed medical cannabis.
7091	Hernandez	Ed	103	LwhIfxRQ9VM	1023	1042	Yes. We have very few primary care providers. We're going to be here doing some hearing on workforce on mental health just period, because I believe not only do we have very few primary care providers, we probably don't have enough mental health providers that are going to be servicing, not only the general population but this population as well.
7092	De Leon	Kevin	102	DaiegGG5yrM	1367	1381	So I can tell you right now with regards to the fossil fuels, we already have that volatility right now. Right now, we have gas price spikes all the time when there's a refinery outage or
7093	Hill	Jerry	66	kbDiQqGDHBM	589	599	There are a number of people I'd like to thank, if I may Mr. President, the Senate and Assembly agriculture committees, especially Senator Galgiani and Assembly Member Perea and their staff.
7094	Stone	Mark	20	leLv2BAfLGY	1181	1197	we unanimously, along with you, urge too, contact the Governor, contact Senator Lara, this and the appropriations committee, so we go down parallel paths. Because one thing I've learned in politics is that the squeaky wheel gets the grease.
7095	Williams	Das	12	jPqrvLMy3Rw	742	758	We don't have enough renewables to meet peak demand, so we are still dependent, especially after the closure of San Onofre, on an extremely dirty, old power plants that take a huge ramp-up time.
7096	Campos	Nora	76	fRdlkKyIGD4	1180	1196	It is time for us to start taking the initiative to make sure that all men and boys of color are successful. I have my speakers and I hopefully, respectfully ask for your aye vote.
7097	Bloom	Richard	2	PFn_-ARbOZU	1086	1106	But we could already, within our process, create that expectation by just demanding that they bring that report when they report to us. They're already coming in and reporting to us. So I'm just not sure how that changes things.
7098	Huff	Bob	105	_BbXW7wLano	898	911	Thank you Mr. President. Members SCR 10 simply names February 19, 2015 as Asian lunar new year. Assembly amendments are minor and technical. I ask for your aye vote.
7099	Baker	Catharine	74	HWoLP0nhI7A	307	324	To provide a service that they may already be willing to provide pro bono. And that we focus those resources on helping students, as well as making sure our VSOs can also make those referrals to pro bono legal services that can help our veterans.
7100	Mullin	Kevin	31	x4d8DYXm7og	1033	1078	I am rescinding the action, whereby the following rules were referred to Committee pursuant to Assembly Rule 77.2. And I'm returning them to the third reading file. AB 864, Williams, from the Natural Resources Committee, AB 361, Achadjian, and AB 693, Eggman, from the Utilities and Commerce Committee. Mr. Holden, you are recognized for your motion.
7101	Wolk	Lois	94	qqrfcEEn454	1277	1286	All right, you've been here for five minutes. He's used up his quota for the rest of the year. You used up your quota for the rest of the year. That's right.
7102	Leyva	Connie	62	VxnkQM8e4Ho	1175	1200	Thank you Mister Chair, good morning gentlemen. I'm very excited to be here. I think we have a real opportunity for this to be a real game changer for the state of California. However, and I don't disagree with anything that anybody said, I think you have a very thoughtful Chair, you're a very thoughtful committee and I think I think you do have to focus on infrastructure and roads, bridges.
7103	Leno	Mark	60	D32BRjJtFrw	1049	1071	But in the Bay Area, for example, we're seeing a lot of population growth as a result of the economic growth that we're seeing. It's like a new Gold Rush, people are rushing to the area to get their part of it. And so that really brings a lot of additional demands to our infrastructure, our roads are so crowded.
7104	Mitchell	Holly	64	w5F9O887PfA	1020	1030	Again, the action is to withdraw two bills from Rules Committee and bring them to the floor. I see there's an objection and therefore we will take roll call. Mr. Secretary call the roll.
7105	Nielsen	Jim	68	CKcxsxPbopg	500	520	I raised the question about the salaries because one particular president had just gotten a huge raise. We had to recruit nationwide. And, I said, you know, are you telling me that we are doing such a poor job at CSU that we can't bring up our own, but we have to go all over the nation to find people and then given these big salaries?
7106	Mitchell	Holly	64	pw6Q8UN0xPc	22	46	Neither of these proposals suggest that we should fund museums. The court system also suggested in that, a suit was bought and lost, and child care, early care education was a part of prop 98 from 1989 until 2011. And so, is it a value statement? Absolutely it is.
7107	Hill	Jerry	66	9xlCmdTyLME	568	588	The bill we had last year that Governor vetoed didn't go quite far enough. We have taken this bill and looked at the interest and moved to a closeness where in one case we're apart by one word and we're trying to just distill that word into something that will work for everyone.
7108	Bonilla	Susan	3	2f3adl3a8Vc	345	373	Thank you very much. Well, that concludes our public participation in the process here. Clearly, we have a job in front of us. We have a report. We have a response to the report. We have the input of professionals in the field, but there is work to be done because there is a recommendation here.
7109	Leno	Mark	60	Jy18DQ2_OCI	92	120	Okay we're clearly keeping this open. I think we've had a bit of an air in here. I appreciate everyone for bearing with my emotional response to this, but it's sincere and let me just say as we move forward that before I could support 40 million and possibly 20 or otherwise for whatever purposes I'd like to see some documented need as to why we need more than 10 billion.
7110	Pan	Richard	96	hYh0N-NJMx0	1762	1777	So, again, I think for managed care organizations it depends on their network and the availability to subspecialty networks. But we can explore that, perhaps, in other hearings. So, I appreciate the data, thank you.
7111	Allen	Benjamin	70	_FfB-BDgorY	184	208	So ultimately, you know, if you're explaining, if a voter comes up to you and says, What the heck's going on in L.A. County? What's your quick answer? Maybe there isn't a quick answer, but how do you answer this question of why we were so far below the rest of the state in voter turnout in the last election? When we had the same issues, same propositions, same candidates as other counties?
7112	Cannella	Anthony	61	oWaFMHsMqpI	1554	1562	Thank you, that was very thorough. So we still have ten bills left, we've heard two so far. So we can just keep our comments brief in support, I would appreciate it.
7113	Gatto	Mike	46	2V6gzfYtqAs	273	289	I mean, we considered things like mailing every parent, so that it's not at a very emotional time. We considered making it at a stage of an ultrasound. So that it was a time where it was a little bit easy, and you're not going into labor and starting to think about pushing, right?
7114	Pan	Richard	96	hYh0N-NJMx0	1739	1749	So I think one of the things we do need to look at, sort of a little transitional to the main subject of this hearing, is the use of the ER.
7115	Quirk	Bill	23	0lsNxjB7bP8	1196	1217	But I'll point out, for example, that when Google started, or any of these other search companies, Yahoo being one of the first, we had no idea what the data they collected would be used for, how it would be collected when it was proper to anonymize it, when it was proper not to. These things all evolved over time.
7116	Mitchell	Holly	64	zKRXexcG8LM	110	125	Sometimes this regimen of drug treatment includes multiple prescriptions that may interact negatively and also may include prescriptions at dosage levels that are inappropriate for the age, weight, and developmental stage of the young person.
7117	McGuire	Mike	93	Pvh7fZV71H4	722	738	So that's why there's been a focus, looking for economic development in rural California that's continued to struggle, and it actually helps your big guys and gals as well, like the LA's, the San Jose's, the San Francisco's. I want to make sure I articulated that correctly.
7118	Alejo	Luis	9	gnd2v7Ro_Uo	1410	1423	That was the only tool that many communities had to create workforce housing for their local constituents. And then that tool was completely gone and that's why there's several bills this year to bring back some type of affordable housing mechanism for cities to use.
7119	Jones	Brian	42	dfinQbvsuZo	452	469	On my own time Mr. Speaker,  I did rise on support for the bill but now that Mr. Daly has taken it upon himself in disparage the new semi-pro team in San Diego I may have to reconsider my vote.
7120	Atkins	Toni	110	ymi21hh5WVg	580	597	Well then there would be federal rules and regulation already in existence. I mean, you're adding this to a list of things and items that have already fallen under the same category, so the same process would be relevant, and the paper.
7121	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	1AD-QUnKZQc	638	665	Thank you. Any other witnesses in support? Any witnesses in opposition? All right, and so I understand it, this bill does not preclude CIDs from restricting the use of clothes lines in areas of a separate interest like a front yard or in common areas, which I think is a I think a good balance here and, are there any questions, Senator Leno?
7122	Stone	Jeff	26	VbSjp8j5tnU	1301	1315	Thank you Madame Chair, honorable committee members. First off, I would like to take all three suggested amendments that the Committee Analysis has authored amendments in addition to the three amendments agreed to in the assembly health that are being taken in this committee.
7123	Pan	Richard	96	4mB1nCFXohc	881	897	So therefore makes sense not to make just the board. I mean if this was really just about Breeze then I could see the board wave one, wave two. But this is now a cost across the board that it makes sense not to have just those two. That a subset of boards actually bear the cost.
7124	Pavley	Fran	104	eibZ1b56Plc	35	49	And I would like to just note for the record one of the reasons we're hearing this sort of late in the process was the spill was a recent problem.
7125	Mullin	Kevin	31	sR3YZBZSyxQ	564	574	Thank you, Mr. Gomez. Seeing no discussion on the item, clerk will open the roll. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote.
7126	McGuire	Mike	93	er20IW1awug	303	315	So, Santa Cruz County saw some challenges as it was reported in the press, and then did your own self-review. What do you do for counties that don't do that?
7127	Leno	Mark	60	w0YskQ9utlg	715	733	Just very briefly, I don't think anyone speaks for the little guy and for the ratepayer more than our sponsor. And our sponsor has been working on these reform issues for many, many years. They were the ones who brought this to our office. I have great trust in them.
7128	Linder	Eric	39	VjN2j4PuSG8	86	103	Just Vice Chair's recommendation, the caucus position will remain a none because there's a fee involved and there are some other provisions in there that may be of concern, but I will be supporting this bill for now.
7129	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	GIcgVGMKBjg	57	271	Colleagues, the secretary notices that we are severely absent a quorum. Would all members please come to the Senate Floor for our 4:00PM session. All Senators to the Senate chamber. Mr. Secretary, please call the roll.
7130	Wood	Jim	72	ZW0bBeI7WzQ	345	364	And some of those are really around kind of updates, reporting. I think the fear is that you give this, and it goes away to CARB and we don't see it, we don't know what's going on. And pretty soon, we're having the challenge of our constituents wondering what we're up to. So that oversight, that reporting back, I think,
7131	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	a6D1KFF96cc	28	53	But at 3 o'clock, we are going to have a special order, and we will be hearing SB 251 by Senator Roth at that time, that is the civil rights disability access. Bill and we will turn out attention to that issue at 3 o'clock. So we will take items up until then.
7132	Gipson	Mike	28	xQtK7XDQgbs	908	933	Okay, you made mention regarding the 2000, or the State Auditor made a mention regarding the 2011 report we talked about Riverside, Santa Barbara Merced, Santa Cruz, and identified the high proportionate of areas of minorities as being underserved. You talked about that that is going to be addressed over time.
7133	Chiu	David	7	_7J2e3A3mdU	246	266	general surveillance and that the videos is recorded on a special dedicated hard drive. The hard drive would only be able to hold three days worth of footage and then erased. And as you put in in the committee analysis there has been no recorded privacy complaint related to this program since the program started in 2007. Knock on wood.
7134	Hueso	Ben	48	G-cKeAHj51U	433	457	This bill wouldn't actually kick in until 2012, I mean 2022 and then they would have four years to prove, they would have to compile four year of data to prove that, four elections, not four years, but four regularly held elections to prove that there's a decrease in voter participation in off-year elections.
7135	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	L_nqL1xdfS8	380	395	Thank you. Are there any witnesses here in support? Any additional witnesses in support? Any witnesses in opposition? Right, bring it to the committee. Any questions from the committee? Senator Leno?
7136	Mitchell	Holly	64	3ozy7hrhoXs	1438	1457	Thank you very much. So we're going to hold open the item on the percutaneous coronary intervention program, just to allow staff further time to evaluate the need for the two additional FTEs, and all the other items were informational, so thank you very much for coming today, appreciate it.
7137	Beall	Jim	92	gDPCmEU7pmg	2138	2170	I just think it, it's good to a thicket that we probably would never get out of if we did that because that would involve re-going back to everybody and having debates in each counties. Some counties will probably look at it favorably and some counties won't. It's a tar baby idea. Do you know what a tar baby is? Everybody all stuck. Rather than just deal with his proposal that seems like a legitimate, fine proposal I would support, but...
7138	Gallagher	James	108	95pquWUVfBw	333	340	And that's exactly why these groups were formed in the first place is because they are trying to provide alternatives, they're trying to provide a full spectrum that you're talking about.
7139	Brown	Cheryl	13	DgVvXUz7n-U	592	627	In the disability community I can see someone coming in and saying you know, your disability is so bad, why don't you just take this pill and leave us? What about the senior citizens, the silver tsunami that I talk about? They're going to be, they're going to challenge the system. California doesn't need this, we don't need this, and I ask for a no vote.
7140	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	0LdXFnPqPCk	213	228	We came into Birmingham where the fabric of a community was torn suddenly with the killing of those four little girls whose only crimes were the color of skin and showing up to the 16th Street Baptist Church for Sunday school.
7141	Mitchell	Holly	64	1grHg8SX3-8	536	554	Excellent. Will you be making a presentation on behalf of Mr. Bland today? She covered it all. Okay. If there are any questions -- any comments from LAO or Finance? Seeing none, we'll open it up for public comment, again on Issues One, Two and Three
7142	Hertzberg	Robert	99	WnmFSvHbO0k	1327	1348	day, which is a Tuesday. Folks gotta work, it's difficult to get to the polls, there's a whole host of reasons. Now, everybody's gonna have a ballot. So, it gives candidates without financial advantage the ability to do the old-fashioned thing of going door-to-door and looking face-to-face with the voter, and asking them for their support.
7143	Kim	Young	82	Hi5Vq6PdNIY	858	873	So let me ask you specifically, how will you prioritize spending in your operating budget if you only received the governor's proposed increase versus your plan which is since the governor's proposal and a tuition hike.
7144	Hertzberg	Robert	99	WnmFSvHbO0k	1296	1312	You know, and I just want to share one other thought, I don't think the fraud argument is gigantic because there can't be much fraud because there's not that many people voting. But, the point is that, I think you're going to have some impact in actually changing the nature of elections, because what happens now?
7145	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	SCWpb6PxRGE	1802	1827	So, I know this bill is a work in progress. And I want to, and I believe I will elicit from Senator Roth a committment that if this bill significantly changes, it goes through the process, that it will come back to us for further consideration in hopes and in expectation that that balancing of, of very serious and important factors is met.
7146	Weber	Shirley	44	jRDlxywi7uQ	1896	1910	Okay, fine. I want to thank Ms. Eggman for presenting the bill to us today. I know this is a complicated issue. I wanna continue to focus on the fact that this is the fiscal Committee that's dealing with this issue much more than the policy.
7147	Dodd	Bill	71	taVqkacMZr4	915	931	I will work on this issue of funding source as this bill moves to the Appropriations committee. Mr. Chairman and members, Clear Lake in Lake County is a state treasure. It is the largest inland body of water in California, totaling 68 miles of surface area.
7148	Patterson	Jim	119	yGdC7D9fPQ8	671	688	And so I would urge, and other members should be urging the Governor and the Legislature to work with the stakeholders during the May revise, so that there can be a resolution to these very troubling consequences of this bill.
7149	Gallagher	James	108	FA0o_dng1YE	2080	2092	Just a quick follow up. Can you remind me so with DACA and DAPA under those programs, does that actually bestow citizenship on those individuals or is it just a right to work a permit.
7150	Levine	Marc	8	yGdC7D9fPQ8	704	725	Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of this critically needed legislation. I thank the leadership on both sides of the aisle and Governor Brown for working together on this. I also thank the author for bringing this measure forward. The drought is real. We are in the fourth year of low water supplies affecting every home and every industry in California.
7151	Gipson	Mike	28	0pvN33z5LJg	44	65	Thank you very much, Mr. Chair and members. I want to thank you for giving me this opportunity to present the personal needs allowance for your consideration to be added to the budget. The personal needs allowance is $35 allowed, allowance to provide to Medi-Cal recipients, who are residents of nursing facilities.
7152	Hernandez	Ed	103	uUsytMtXn1I	0	23	I believe Assemblymember Stone, who graciously allowed Assemblymember Bonilla to go first, you're next, and then I- Quite the gentleman. And a scholar. And then I saw, I think, Assemblymember Gatto? He'll be after Assemblymember Stone.
7153	De Leon	Kevin	102	SU8_KAMcIaE	236	256	Whether it's NOx, whether it's SOx, whether its particulate matter 2.5,  whether it's black carbon, slow lived climate, short-lived I should say, climate pollutants has disproportionally impacted, geographically an area like the San Joaquin/ Central Valley area.
7154	Quirk	Bill	23	dJ6Is8ZeyoY	721	733	I agree about not disrupting supplies over and over again, and that very much the Western States Petroleum Association, I'd like to say that they could be a great partner in moving this forward.
7155	Levine	Marc	8	XV5_C2m16bM	534	544	first of all I'm grateful that he's alive and communicating to all of us and remember the great work that he did with China Camp, and really grateful for his leadership on the
7156	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	Oggr1OKYFzQ	688	707	And I think it's critically important that we now try to get a handle on this, and that we learn how these things are being done so we can determine whether or not there needs to be some control or regulation or accountability for things now that are just frankly out there that are in some respects beyond our wildest imaginations,
7157	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	GIcgVGMKBjg	447	489	Republican caucus is called in the Cox Lounge. Republican caucus. And the Senate will come back into session. Please caucus is concluded. Mr. Secretary, please read the Committee report. All members, we're back in session.
7158	Stone	Jeff	26	pw6Q8UN0xPc	1454	1480	I can also tell you, and I'm not ashamed to say it, I've been a successful capitalist. I've owned a number of businesses, I still operate businesses while I'm here, and one of the most important factors in my success is I don't spend more than I take in. That I budget based on true numbers, true revenue expectations.
7159	Maienschein	Brian	84	UonYQneKEjk	1486	1514	This would make it illegal for an insurance provider to deny insurance to a property owner or landlord on the basis that the tenants participate in the section 8 voucher program. My staff and I've been working diligently with the opposition to address their issues. As a result of the amendments taken on the floor on Tuesday, most of the industry groups have gone neutral. Even though they have removed their opposition, the remaining ones I'm still committed to working with all the stakeholders to address remaining concerns.
7160	Pan	Richard	96	a6D1KFF96cc	1042	1060	California's also the most it leads the country in the diversity of its immigrant status with 50% of California's immigrants are naturalized citizens, and another 26% have some other legal status. California is the most linguistically diverse state, with 207 languages spoken by four, over 40% of Californians.
7161	Levine	Marc	8	rOcxPrNyERc	1593	1609	Thank you very much Mr. Speaker and members. AB 786 will close a loophole in existing law that allows an HOA to fine homeowners who allow their lawns to turn brown. I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
7162	Mendoza	Tony	52	gN6B3iXXHo0	2198	2212	And that's what it should be about, not to be punitive measure in anyway. So, I will be supporting it, but I'm kinda optimistic, you'll be working with the opposition to get this in a place where they can be comfortable with.
7163	Nielsen	Jim	68	b8mZhVlBtpE	1307	1334	And I need to ask a couple of questions. Though the language that we're going to have here, does it have anything in it related to numbers of people? Assembly member Weber talked about the ratios and such. Roughly, are we talking about a certain ratio that will be required, providers per preschool students?
7164	Monning	Bill	25	-v1uD0LX8sQ	895	910	Madam President and members. I rise in opposition to SB350. And, I'm going to say I'm going to quote some of the same numbers that my colleague from Dimabar did, but I think some of us probably need to hear it twice.
7165	Leyva	Connie	62	9GlTqPUGK00	539	563	Thank you Mr President. I just have to get up and express my strong support for this bill and passion about jobs. I am also passionate about affordable health care. I was told early on do not fall in love with your bills, so I'm not in love with my bills, but Senator Leno I'm in love with this bill. We all pay for our healthcare, this is something that all of us here have talked about on both sides of the aisle and that is transparency.
7166	Monning	Bill	25	Emq8Vus1fxY	2228	2265	It does. Yeah, I think that's helpful. I could drill down on that a little bit. Just the region I'm in and I guess the final question, is the department with these resources, responsive to either local health departments? Or even, what if there were a neighborhood or a citizen's group concerned about clusters of birth defects? Is there a responsive mechanism in this? Or is it just based on your risk strategy vectors around the state?
7167	Gipson	Mike	28	r0_c68VZXFY	1077	1095	There's no mistaking about what transpired. And if we could change the hands of time, we would make sure this doesn't take place, but still have the result where we have businesses, we have an institution of health care that's provided and bears the name of Dr. Martin Luther King.
7168	Gatto	Mike	46	TmtzANXYgv0	1016	1037	And to extent that this house gives people the benefit of the doubt based on the authors, you certainly have it because of your past history along with Ms. Eggman, and Mr. Stone and Mr. Jones and all the terrific bipartisan team you have on this bill, of working for measures that I think are in the benefit of the consumer.
7169	Allen	Benjamin	70	zqM_Vy0kspE	166	178	We have minimum fuel-efficiency standards for automobiles and performance standards for gasoline. We can achieve similar results with this minimum performance standard for motor oil, it's on the market, it works well, it's existing right now.
7170	Allen	Travis	43	jAVMxyN_c9U	973	1000	Thank you very much. I like to correct member speakers on the floor who said that there was no impact here on AB 645 and raising the RPS, the real portfolios standard from a current level 33% to 50%. According to the US energy information administration, California's residential electricity rates in 2014 were 41% higher than the national average.
7171	Gipson	Mike	28	SQe4IQVjZKc	353	368	And they enrolled and they qualify for the services but yet and still, you know, they're waiting an exorbitant amount of time to receive these kind of services. Again patient care is at risk as it relates to the lack thereof.
7172	Steinorth	Marc	35	VFoe5hvDs-o	872	882	This body, I believe, is looking at possibly amending it to where you could go from the retired to the retired active, which I believe is something we'd be very open to discuss.
7173	De Leon	Kevin	102	8E9La7s73fc	381	392	So we are looking towards your leadership to protect the interests of the state of California and to protect our climate portfolio as well, here in the state of California.
7174	Pavley	Fran	104	YkUq4Ko6zik	966	982	Made the motion regarding this particular item but I just wanted to note for the record I did not support SB1077, that's the pilot program. I'm a real skeptic...
7175	McGuire	Mike	93	X49dPLJib5g	670	682	As far as opt, putting Airbnb out in communities, out of business in communities where they already have ordinances. Well, they're not supposed to be operating if the local law says they can't operate.
7176	Maienschein	Brian	84	FgksiwkXKF4	875	900	I wanna thank you for your work with the committee as well to get to this point. I'll be supporting it, I think there's this need, I know in my prior life as a city council member, this issue came up several times. And so I think this is an important bill to address a real problem that affects local government. So I want to thank you for bringing that and I'll be in support.
7177	Stone	Jeff	26	npLG8Ena6eQ	476	491	But, what we're being asked to do today is give the government the okay to people diagnosed with terminal illness with six months or less to live, to kill themselves even though we all know that sometimes these diagnoses are wrong.
7178	Moorlach	John	4657	qnIAoFuwUn0	1312	1338	That there should be some discussion as to, you know, if you wanna keep building and growing you can't always have it done by the general fund if it's being depleted by other, you know, costs. So I'm just thinking out loud but I I'm just, I'm not finding a guarantee that you have a guarantee so I I'm just poking and asking.
7179	Melendez	Melissa	41	b7XHatlYhkw	1269	1284	AB 289 would extend the same protection to other state worker, or excuse me, extend the same protection other state workers receive by establishing the Legislative Employee Whistleblower Protection Act, that's a mouthful, isn't it?
7180	Eggman	Susan Talamantes	73	cKW0dtBGGXY	2049	2062	Thank you, and thank you, Senator, for working on this. And I, too, struggle with some of the issues that I've heard from some of my colleagues. As somebody who didn't intentionally become apparent. Spent a lot of time researching. When I hear flame retardant. I mean, embarrassing as it may be, I don't know that that's a bad thing, right?
7181	Hernandez	Ed	103	7ULUe19PTjQ	140	158	And with such a large endeavor, I will take time, but I am confident that we will move forward and get this thing done. The goal of the bill along with several other bills I'm authoring this year is to empower consumers and purchasers with the information necessary for them to obtain quality healthcare at a reasonable price.
7182	Weber	Shirley	44	BMNgYibzIuk	519	538	Only thing I caution is on and not us, but on those who are here testifying is that they use the term accountability. It's more serious than what you guys are giving. Accountability is not everybody just simply telling a report. Accountability talks about responsibility, and it also talks about consequences.
7183	Wieckowski	Bob	55	dPeGakg4w7Y	929	947	I wanna be sure that when I get that second legislation, I gave several elections for the county to decide, and based on their expenditure plan, one to go out, and if I'm reading it right, this is up to the county, whenever they want to, there's no limitation on it.
7184	Atkins	Toni	110	Rt-g3tEX78Q	348	449	Please join me in welcoming Doctor Sae Yung Kang, Mr. Moon Su Kim, Doctor Tae Kim and Dr. Ge Wu Shin. Welcome. Ms. Bonilla, are you prepared to welcome your guests?
7185	Mitchell	Holly	64	gCh9-ng4HsU	802	824	While the near-term costs of eliminating the rule are significant, more broadly, the long-term effects of this repeal are unknown, but could significantly reduce the cost of the projected lifetime physical, mental and social impacts related to children raised in poverty and long term economic and social effects linked to this policy.
7186	Atkins	Toni	110	Rt-g3tEX78Q	311	330	This esteemed delegation is visiting Sacramento as participants of the US state department's International Visitor Leadership Program to learn about US politics and elections law and economic development in innovation in California.
7187	Atkins	Toni	110	Rt-g3tEX78Q	330	348	They're being hosted by the Northern California World Trade Center in order to meet and confer with their professional counterparts in the United States and California to gain a greater understanding of U.S. society and experience American culture first-hand.
7188	Patterson	Jim	119	qbDN-8u61LI	1445	1466	Appreciate it. I object a bit to the suggestion that there are personalities. I don't know why you have to do a separate bill than AB 266. We sent over a really good bill. Why can't you just accept that, amend some of it, send it back over?
7189	Melendez	Melissa	41	BcOJ4WzBt0M	323	336	When I served on the Veterans Committee, we would, as you know, often have people come forward and talk about the need for people to work at these centers specifically for women's issues.
7190	Stone	Jeff	26	LrUb6Z3dcdU	456	480	I think many of them want to work back in the workforce but, there's this fear, and I don't blame them, because I have seen this fear with people that have come to my office, as a county supervisor, that should they get training and get back into the workforce and find a particular job may not be appropriate for them and they have to get back into the SSI program.
7191	McGuire	Mike	93	qbDN-8u61LI	1435	1445	And that is why we are meeting with Cal Chiefs. And again, I encourage you to do your reference checks on me. Go check with Cal Chiefs and confirm that we're talking with them on a weekly basis.
7192	Low	Evan	11	QkQlxH8U7IE	1453	1474	Thank you very much, Madam Chair, for allowing me to present Assembly Bill 883. I know that the committee was kind enough to allow my staff member to spend last time around, and I simply ask for aye vote. And I'm happy to answer any questions that you might have. And I believe that we also have some individuals who are here to also testify in support, should that be-
7193	Alejo	Luis	9	fNO-vhR1Uas	640	658	And know, with past Governors sometimes during emergency declarations, there's been some exemptions done to deal with some of these CEQA issues, to do with trying to expedite the process through this emergency. So there's precedent that we should be certainly looking at as well.
7194	Pan	Richard	96	EvD39W6YJ0A	1192	1208	Thank you. I just want to clarify in terms of so currently teachers they get the differential pay for the first when they use, I just wanna clarify what they currently do and what this bill's doing.
7195	Weber	Shirley	44	dv1TuQD9iKk	957	970	It had to do with folks coming out of realignment, and the police department discovered that most of 'em rode the trolley in this little city of mine called Lemon Grove. So, they get on the bus in Lemon Grove, and they go through the trolley, seeing if you have a ticket.
7196	Mitchell	Holly	64	bkbYI6-vC30	2327	2341	Well I think it's all of us, the Executive branch is coming to us. Everybody's got skin in the game. The Executive branch is coming to us to allocate, right, the money to fix it after the fact.
7197	Obernolte	Jay	86	7f5uDPxTBXo	322	329	It's my pleasure. Good morning Mr Chair and Members. Before I was elected to the State Assembly I has served as the mayor of the City of Big Bear Lake.
7198	Wieckowski	Bob	55	84LBK3fic7E	1522	1532	Well, I'm going to be supporting this bill, and if Senator Cannella can get another bill with $4 billion bucks, then we would -- Yeah. We'd have something going.
7199	Beall	Jim	92	84LBK3fic7E	1502	1513	So it wouldn't be -- the money wouldn't just sit there until some -- it won't be like the lottery, like the Super Lotto, like you -- the money will sit there and accumulate until somebody gets the lotto ticket.
7200	Pan	Richard	96	KLz991S1PxQ	868	886	Is that because there was a recruitment period that happened during a period of time that now has fallen off? And so the younger civil servants and who we're recruiting is not, we're not able to keep up with what we've been able to do before, or are...? So I just wanted to clarify that statement.
7201	Wagner	Donald	88	qBs9W23Am_w	164	181	And the flipside to that is also occurring, for lack of anything better to call it, a zero tier. If you can't get a hearing, if you can't get your domestic violence case heard, if you can't get, you know, you pick the matter, we are failing our constituents and you have identified it.
7202	Chavez	Rocky	83	5fJ7Ysn9i88	1192	1207	I also know, that we need to take care of the individuals transitioning out of prison so that we can reduce our populations. So I'll be looking at that very strongly and just wanted to make a public statement.
7203	Pavley	Fran	104	GkK_99mYtlc	40	60	And from perhaps a different perspective, but we'll wait and see on that, Briana Mordick, Staff Scientist, Natural Resources Defense Council, and Briana, make sure you tell me if there's anything I don't know about new technologies in your presentation. That's how I found out the last one.
7204	Allen	Benjamin	70	QF0xTMWqn0g	1814	1825	Not that steam fracturing, but that injecting steam underground at pressures so high that it cracks open underground rock formations, is in violation of state and federal regulation. That is in the article. I am just trying to get clarification.
7205	Pan	Richard	96	IUqqKj1b5UE	443	459	And Senator Beall, I just wanted to thank you for trying to take on there a very thorny issue because I think because I think one of the things we're all challenged with this is that's actually the nature of payment between outpatient and inpatient.
7206	Wood	Jim	72	jDVMk92LYlk	28	49	In 27 years of practice as a dentist, I never had a patient say to me, boy, am I glad I started smoking. Indeed, nationwide 90% of smokers wish they had never started. I saw oral disease progress before my eyes, I saw tooth loss, yellowing of teeth, significant decay, gum disease, and yes, oral cancer.
7207	Gatto	Mike	46	toyLEHK5bMU	297	315	tasked with representing and their residents. And I emphasize it steals money from cities that acted completely legally based on the laws that we made up until this point. So this is not about taking money back during a really tough time for the budget.
7208	Leyva	Connie	62	Lmzm4UU691s	1622	1638	And your, your staff can reflect a better, a less gap than the gap that is, you know, the 21%. And, because it was very disheartening for me. I think I shared that with you when we met, that we have civil servants, employees of the state of California.
7209	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	ZcJSZ4qEe4Y	1365	1374	We look at the school facility needs over the next 20 years. There are more than that. In fact, there are double than that. This would meet half that need.
7210	Lara	Ricardo	107	PFn_-ARbOZU	94	118	Yes. It is true, the fact about the InterGen care and the clinics. But that is literally a patchwork, and it depends on county to county. I know Fresno County was at one point, deliberating eliminating their entire care. And so again, that is a huge population of folks that would be in peril there.
7211	Hill	Jerry	66	q3wgHNrBLP0	130	146	Local decision making remains. All the bill required is that they look at using non waste tire alternatives. I'll continue working with the opposition on amendments to address concerns while the bill is on suspense. Regarding the fiscal aspects of the bill, the study is the main cost driver.
7212	De Leon	Kevin	102	TrPgAQvjTc0	1383	1408	Well, thank you very much, Mr. President. Colleagues, this is a very important measure. It has AB32 that was authored by then Assembly woman Fran Pavley and our speaker Meredith Nunez set the framework, if you will, to help bolster the economy the State of California and set realistic targets that are beyond- not beyond, but within our reach.
7213	Mitchell	Holly	64	GnxGwd8ZNfU	703	744	Couple of pieces that aren't included in today's agenda, but I think are an important part of this whole overall discussion. A) is the current program maintaining poverty and deep poverty or is it indeed a path out of poverty? Number two, what are the effects of the current policies on children? Are they being supported? Or are they harmed? Three, childcare has demonstrated positive impact on children and allows parents to work. Why is the uptake rate for stage one childcare among welfare-to-work recipients currently 29% per the LAO data. You'll see that in a presentation later today. I read it.
7214	Stone	Jeff	26	1VsIgdliTQw	323	351	Naturalized citizen children shouldn't they come first before we spend a quarter of $1 trillion on undocumented children that are not here legally. I know it's a touchy sensitive issue, but I think that the priorities are just wrong. I think we need to take care of our own first. And, then we should be able to provide healthcare for those in the humanitarian ways that Americans are known to be.
7215	Medina	Jose	81	bencsnxh2-c	1294	1307	We took the recommendation from the West Coast College to limit the Cal Grant restoration to Corinthian students, and we accepted the recommendations from Caps to apply the community college provision only to Corinthian students.
7216	Bonta	Rob	85	QOFO_OlHLpI	88	97	I think the motion for consideration is only appropriate after there's been a vote and it doesn't have enough votes to pass. And, if the assembly member from Los Angeles is willing to withdraw the motion.
7217	Hertzberg	Robert	99	DT3707YnrIQ	736	755	Thank you. Okay, any others in support? Any opposition? You know, the staff gave me a copy of the May 2015 report by your authority to the State Legislature and it's pretty amazing if you look by sectors, by the North American Industry Classification System Sectors, it's quite amazing.
7218	Nazarian	Adrin	36	5Qw_YsDfvQ4	49	60	Thank you all for being here and I did not include numerous other individuals who are sitting up in the gallery. Thank you all for being here. Thank you.
7219	Leno	Mark	60	ZnhfCEAKzDU	909	925	But as an employer for the past 37 years, I have never once thought of forcing such an agreement upon someone as a condition of employment. It just wouldn't feel right. And I don't want to suggest that there's no benefit to arbitration.
7220	Wilk	Scott	19	fRdlkKyIGD4	1554	1578	Thank you, sir. AB 85 clarifies a loophole in the Bagley-Keene Act in order to insure state boards and agencies are conducting all meetings in an open, transparent manner. Current law allows agencies to exploit the loophole and it's become a common practice to establish two member bodies in order not to hold public meetings.
7221	Thurmond	Tony	4	HBOX_ihiZFg	528	541	I want to thank all of the folks who were in this room, who yelled at me a few weeks ago to help me understand the urgency. It was frustrating, it was hard to hear. It was hard to hear it because I thought, well, I get your urgency.
7222	Nielsen	Jim	68	k_l5daYZc00	342	356	Towards the areas of greatest need, where they can, the dollars are gonna be most efficiently and effectively, and have the most singular, greatest impact. And this is not something new. Really it's tried and proven.
7223	Maienschein	Brian	84	Y_pbsK-_qw0	1580	1605	Sure. Mr. Chairman, on your points. Clearly it provides savings to the consumer on that day. I would disagree with the characterization that it wouldn't provide savings. It would provide savings on that day. It's debatable how much that is in total, but it certainly is a day's worth of it. And as opposed to other jurisdictions doing it, there's 15 other states that do it, that provide that option,
7224	Rodriguez	Freddie	69	C3fC_QKuL0U	1738	1758	Things are so different, compared to we moved out now that because things are changing we need to be in the forefront of those changes as well and how we implement things differently, but it really comes to everybody working together, right? Building those relationships and make things work to serve the people that we're here to serve.
7225	Pavley	Fran	104	45ZR2HT6sPs	203	217	It gets complicated and it is competetive. So, this bill's a good faith attempt based on the testimony of our November 20th hearing. We look forward to talking to Assembly Member Alejo as his bill moves forward.
7226	Allen	Benjamin	70	LYOrqHadQ70	498	513	I do think there are a couple, there's some misperceptions about homeschools and the medical exemption and ultimately I hope those were addressed in the discussion today. I really appreciate everyone's comments and I respectfully ask for an aye vote.
7227	Wieckowski	Bob	55	1-lHMg2FsZ4	220	237	Well, I mean, after reading the staff report, I had my staff do some research. Because there are other California manufacturers that are, that are here. In the electric vehicle, segment doing direct sales and manufacturing here. I know down in Ontario there's Phoenix Motor Company.
7228	De Leon	Kevin	102	pmq1wDNXXkw	880	898	It's absolutely critical that we work with the manufactures, with the dealers. We have to work with the dealers, because, you know, it's one of those, the old adage, if the tree falls in the middle of the forest and you're not there to see it, hear it, witness it. Did it really fall?
7229	Pavley	Fran	104	UOAgtw9idpM	2092	2117	The language in the build this particular bill after the veto by the Governor the prior one to work and have a public, the opportunity for the public to access the information this language in the bill was negotiated with the DWR with the Department of Public Health services and CalEMA to ensure the language does not improperly disclosed any privileged information.
7230	Ting	Philip	30	QruWeQOWjh0	1480	1494	And I think that we can no longer hold our community colleges hostage, and I think we can not expect the community colleges to reform this commission that frankly oversees their accreditation, which is their life blood.
7231	Brown	Cheryl	13	yFQH5D8dVds	403	432	One of the things that my staff is saying is that the across-the-board participation, kind of, if you're looking at planning, design, environmental engineering, construction, it currently all of the goals are just dumped into construction, for example. There's no other things that can be done that fulfill this goal of 3%?
7232	Mitchell	Holly	64	2MXVIex_Zeg	551	571	3-0, recommendation. Item 5, Medicount Annual Open Enrollment Period. The recommendation is to reject ,the legislature denies similar proposals in the last few years because it found that it's important to ensure that Medi-Cal enrollees have the ability to change health plans at any time to ensure that his or her health care needs are met.
7233	Stone	Mark	20	uR7IVED3sSY	819	841	Thank you. Do you have witnesses in support? Seeing none, is there anyone who would like to speak on this bill in support? Thank you we do have a motion and a second. Seeing no other supporters is there anyone who would like to speak on this bill in opposition? Seeing none, I'll bring it back to the Committee. Questions, comments? Mr. Wagner.
7234	Stone	Jeff	26	-yLqvo8WX6M	818	829	Senator Nielsen, I just wanted to get back to the last question. I strongly feel that through the GPS coordinates that you actually would be providing a lot more clarity about where you can trap and where you can't trap.
7235	Waldron	Marie	29	xdTTK0YoutY	700	713	In 2014, graphic poses surfaced of actress Jennifer Lawrence on Twitter, and this is an ongoing problem as we're in the digital age, and this is a clear violation of privacy.
7236	Quirk	Bill	23	nJsCwYpjBcE	1430	1437	I'm sorry. Shoot. You know, I'm so used to- you're such a good friend that I couldn't help it. You know, I just love you so much, Roger. Quirk, no.
7237	Roth	Richard	106	ewcXToh_gOY	1618	1634	Thank you, Mr. Chair, members. I'm privileged to present Senate Bill 536 today. It's a bill to authorize the sale of the military, some military department armories that are no longer suitable or safe for use by our National Guard troops.
7238	McGuire	Mike	93	qbDN-8u61LI	327	339	And these rogue operators have clear cut thousands of acres of forest illegally, both on public and private lands without regard for the long term impacts they are creating for neighboring land owners, downstream farms or endangered species.
7239	Block	Marty	59	pmfMdqMvBTk	1328	1345	Okay, the staff recommendation is that we hold this item open and it'll move to full budget committee. Any members of the public wish to speak on this? Seeing none, questions or comments from committee members?
7240	Cannella	Anthony	61	MJ3yc4dhcxc	1949	1970	Okay. So what authority does the DMV now have to change the fee? Could you just on your own say, well look, we think that allegedly one company's providing five services for that $25, and one company's providing one service for $25, therefore, the fee may be too high? Do you have the ability to go back and say we're going to reevaluate the fee and lower the fee?
7241	Beall	Jim	92	pr4Lpt1U5o4	287	302	Just a general comment about Inspector Generals, I think that's important to understand what we're doing. We're creating an Inspector General for the transportation agency. The Inspector General that was, we have an Inspector General act in California for other departments.
7242	Pan	Richard	96	t4_AyYAahhk	864	889	And there is flexibility in the sense that this is a cap for the district, so there is flexibility within that. But we should, for the district overall, try to move forward and not backwards. And so I think that certainly there's going to need to be more, I appreciate having continuing conversations, but I think it's important to keep this discussion moving forward.
7243	De Leon	Kevin	102	xrb7OkoktfM	1501	1522	deemed read. Messages from Assembly also will be deemed read. Reports of the Committee will be deemed read. Motions, resolutions, and notices at this moment I'm seeing none. We have no introductions and first reading of bills. Mr. Secretary, please read There are none, bills will be deemed not read because there's none. We do have also with us today
7244	Fuller	Jean	49	52URYfZsNNs	1654	1670	Thank you. It's-- Actually, I did teach PE myself at one time. Actually, I came from a very small town, very small agricultural town. My best interest was a horse. That was my highest hobby that I had.
7245	Dababneh	Matthew	50	1ULf869aoVg	1251	1275	I just want to thank my co-authors. I love that we can have a bipartisan bill in this way to make sure that we keep accountable those that take taxpayer funding for research. Once again, this is not interfere with the research process. This simply says that at the conclusion of the research these animals will be given a chance to become someone's pet. I think that's a very reasonable measure for humane state. I respectfully ask your aye vote.
7246	Hueso	Ben	48	RFWwgE7ubok	1430	1455	The enhanced driver's license, also the acronym EDL will be enhanced in process, technology, and security to denote both identity and citizenship at sea and land ports of entry. An EDL is an RFID chip enabled travel document that allows travelers to wave their EDL at a card reader before approaching the customs officer.
7247	Leno	Mark	60	Ir2eiizDgdE	714	741	To define e-cigarettes as a tobacco product. As such, with that in statute, it would fall under our California smoke free laws, which means places where smoking traditional cigarettes is prohibited, would it be the same for e-cigarettes, as well as having e-cigarettes fall under our STAKE act, which is to Stop Tobacco Access to Kids Enforcement act.
7248	Lara	Ricardo	107	qM5DAHMb8ig	43	57	The bill as amended would appropriated approximately 2., 24.1 million, I'm sorry, 24.1 million from the general fund, and about 141 thousand from a special fund to pay settlements in four claims against the state.
7249	Pavley	Fran	104	9ZvAfunEMro	200	214	I guess you do. That's right, your Committee Bills. Well one is on consent, so file item 22 somehow didn't make consent, so let's find out why. So Committee Bill, Assembly Bill 1528.
7250	Mitchell	Holly	64	31W9cfaQWLY	440	456	As the President stated Saturday, "with effort we can rollback poverty and create equal opportunity." I was struck as a news commentators did the comparison between some of 50 years ago and Selma today. They talked about Alabama's child poverty rate been one-in-five.
7251	Mitchell	Holly	64	31W9cfaQWLY	504	522	We were reminded by the President Saturday of the people that love this country so much that they gave their very lives. The episcopal minister, the young white mother of five. They all loved it so much and were true patriots that they were willing to give their very lives to protect her integrity and they did.
7252	Rodriguez	Freddie	69	uMVL-8VKWCc	262	275	I also want to thank the Chair for bringing this very important bill forward to have better access and opportunities for the folks to get better reimbursement rates, better access to care, and also with that, I would like to also be added as a co-author on your bill as well, thank you.
7253	Burke	Autumn	6	s0a4gZFkKY4	1670	1695	What this allows them to do is open their own practices without supervision, in these same communities. This greatly increases minorities and urban areas, and rural areas. The opportunity to have, for those women who right now are clearly sorely lacking the opportunity to have access to quality healthcare.  Does that answer your question?
7254	Wilk	Scott	19	l1F5HIZMtYI	481	503	On occasion, again appreciate the comments from the opponents at least currently. Hopefully we'll get them on board if we're able to move forward. I should point out that it's Federal guidelines, it's not law. Putting the 120% in there reflects what the guidelines are but it's not stated categorically. So this is, again, just to protect taxpayers.
7255	Thurmond	Tony	4	xhW2CTHp7eQ	0	15	We like to hear from the speakers again, because of the volume of our meeting today, we're asking everyone if you keep it to one minute or less. We don't like to interrupt people so we ask you to work with us today. We look forward to hearing what you have to say. Please, you may begin.
7256	Stone	Jeff	26	J_Iq4rTF6rc	897	919	No, I'm not saying that at all. I'm saying there certainly is a lot of preparation, but I can tell you that in no way do many of these commissions serve 40 hours a week in, in service. I would say, I would argue that it's much less. Like, I'm, I'm not stuck on the number of $12,000. I would, very happy to hear what you feel might be appropriate for these commissions.
7257	Mullin	Kevin	31	yAgUQvRrkrQ	1111	1139	Ms. Campos. Ms. Campos, you are recognized for your adjournment. Members, please take your seats. Please take your seats members. Ms Campos, you are recognized for your adjournment in memory.
7258	Mullin	Kevin	31	yAgUQvRrkrQ	1103	1111	Moving to adjournments in memories as well as additional announcements. Requests to adjourn to memory. The following members were granted prior permission to speak on an adjournment in memory.
7259	Brown	Cheryl	13	I6IkPPhOVjM	332	351	ave grown to shocking levels, the public is rapidly losing faith that government can properly respond to the desperate pleas for help from our constituents. Last year we heard that there's a backlog of 11,000 complaints
7260	Eggman	Susan Talamantes	73	xlFASx7RMqI	430	444	\\We're glad to work with people, but the point is the bill is to go statewide and if counties want to opt out, then they would be able to opt out. So to take that amendment would, in essence, we'd be at status quo.
7261	Moorlach	John	4657	xvcU4IJP8VQ	919	938	Thirdly I just recently reviewed the legislative analyst's report on BART, the Bay Area Rapid Transit. And they're screaming and going, oh my goodness. We've got 20 year old cars, and we have no money to replace them. And it just seems like, well, wait a second. You should have been thinking about that 20 years ago.
7262	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	iSM5Bpt31OQ	532	552	Thank you, smart man, indeed. Any-- anyone else here in support of the measure? Any opposition? Any questions. Motion by Senator Hertzberg. Senator Cannella is asking for an Aye vote. The motion is do pass as amended to Senate appropriations. Please call the roll.
7263	Brown	Cheryl	13	I6IkPPhOVjM	394	410	had remained open for an average of nearly a year. Now can we think about that just for a moment? A year. After someone was concerned enough to take on the burden of reporting, they wait an average of a year.
7264	Hertzberg	Robert	99	hp2WTRF5hkg	388	400	What I want to do and what I said in my opening was I, I do agree with you but I think that what you've done is you've been too restrictive. All you've done is you've said, okay, we're going to raise the cap to people who are on the list in 2012. I don't know of that's real.
7265	Weber	Shirley	44	ZcJSZ4qEe4Y	1757	1768	So, I'm wondering if this bill, at some point, is going to, or if it does, I didn't see it in there, deal with the issue of multicultural counseling, especially in, in the environment in which we exist in California.
7266	De Leon	Kevin	102	KHtTIUat0hU	25	37	We had a... just a very large press conference a few moments ago and I appreciate you and the colleagues of the Committee for your great patience. Thank you very much.
7267	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	TgDKGcmi03Q	314	336	So, with that I just want to conclude my my opening remarks by saying that it's imperative that we look at rail as an integral part of our transportation infrastructure. It is a viable 21st century technology to move people, as well as goods, from place to place.
7268	Weber	Shirley	44	ZcJSZ4qEe4Y	1768	1780	You know, much of our special ed populations over the years, we've had difficulty with them being diagnosed in terms of behavioral issues because people didn't understand the cultural elements of a particular population, of a particular community.
7269	Wieckowski	Bob	55	hOXjsAX0HBg	1833	1854	Are you suggesting that there's two different standards of the permitting, I mean, I understand, it's the applicant that comes forward and they choose a site. But the permit, whether it's in Beverly Hills or Kettleman City is still the same process, the same state law that has to be complied with.
7270	De Leon	Kevin	102	3CsrxcXxpcI	447	469	Yes, it will, and let me just add one thing to what Senator Hueso mentioned, because Senator Hueso mentioned Chicano Park, and we grew up in the same neighborhood. What's fascinating is, if Chicano Park never came to fruition, there were be no park; not one single acre, not half an acre, not a quarter acre of any green space whatsoever in this area.
7271	Mitchell	Holly	64	0QEuIEsELpg	26	46	Senator Hernandez, contrary to what popular belief, or what you might assume I am not the boss of him. Now, I do have a son, but it ain't him. He has, he has a lovely mother, so let's call her, let's call her.
7272	Chau	Ed	116	Vrc3ih-DRQU	1645	1659	Let me be very specific and clear. The Local Funding Formula has nothing to do with this particular bill. In fact, this bill would create a public-private partnership, and the funding is going to come from private sources.
7273	Rendon	Anthony	120	0lsNxjB7bP8	1921	1937	Perhaps were gonna have Mrs. Garcia asks her, ask her question in a second. Before she does I want to remind the committee members that this bill, if it passes out of this committee, will go to the Privacy and Consumer Protection Committee. Mrs. Garcia.
7274	Hadley	David	40	GL6n7Ol5uP8	587	628	why this capacity gets snapped up instantaneously. So my question is whether you would be willing to consider amendments that would either increase the cost of direct access consumers returning to the regulated utilities. Or whether you would consider amendments to give the utilities the right to serve these returning customers at a market clearing price, rather than a regulated price. That's true for six months.
7275	Hernandez	Roger	37	FrhvFMPe7A8	151	169	Public education and unionization efforts are threatened by schools that are managed by private, for-profit companies that soak up public funds and often direct them out of state. This bill is sponsored by the California Teachers Association, the California Federation of Teachers, and the California Labor Federation.
7276	Rendon	Anthony	120	yegxkcxS3po	503	523	This morning I'm respectfully requesting an audit of the Central Basin Municipal Water District along with co-requesters Ms. Garcia and, Mr. Lara. The Central Basin Municipal Water District was created in 1952 to import a supplemental water supply from Northern California and the Colorado river.
7277	McGuire	Mike	93	f0azg54_KEY	1251	1279	I think where, just being candid, where I have some challenges is that when we're asking for the Board of Barbering and Cosmetology, just focused on one industry than taking on the issue of alcohol just has some concerns in regard to, in particularly the interface with local government in taking on an issue that is out of what their traditional purview has been.
7278	McGuire	Mike	93	Rj2lrXkjDIw	2390	2417	But coming from a public utility background, they made incredible strides related in meeting where the state is wanting to go without the mandate and do they bring power cheaper. So when we take a look at NCPA for example. We have a lot of cities that are almost there or there and we-- if you would ever add geo-- if you were ever to add hydro, it will be far exceeding.
7279	Mullin	Kevin	31	KQICDVGfqPQ	999	1010	Thank you, Mr. Patterson. Members, please bring the names to the desk that we printed in the journal. All request to adjourn in memory will be deemed red and printed in the journal. Members I've been told that we have a birthday on the floor today, Assembly Member Jim Cooper is celebrating a birthday. Happy birthday, Mr Cooper.
7280	Allen	Benjamin	70	UOAgtw9idpM	927	945	And I know you're talking about this in the context of a boost to the economy, you know, I know John talked about this, but what has the BLM done, for example, done to promote tourism in Carrizo Plain? And is that, are you really going to get more tourism under the current structure?
7281	Mitchell	Holly	64	yp3pHtPtFfM	405	419	Really it's like it's a question for Mr. Taylor in the LAO. When we recognize listening to Senator Monning listening to Senator Pan about the magnitude of disinvestment we've made in that area.
7282	Hernandez	Ed	103	WpcX9flvLXg	567	588	Thank you, Madam Chair. Madam President, members, this bill would establish a pilot program that would change the way Medi-Cal pays federally qualified health centers, known as FQHCs, using an alternative payment methodology that would provide greater flexibility in how they deliver care.
7283	Block	Marty	59	Ouu9P0a4sNE	1143	1169	Also second question. Second question deals with the performance, and, and the way I do performance for students with disabilities as compared to the, national average. Is that broken down by and we just have a general statement, that's all understood. I assume it's broken down by racial ethnic groups and in other ways.
7284	Liu	Carol	63	h0Gkdxuepz8	32	50	In the last weeks we have heard from students that are facing serious educational and financial repercussions. Some of whom were merely units from completing their program and are now left with significant debt. Today, it is my hope that we not only find out what relief state agencies and
7285	Gomez	Jimmy	80	0KJVRFCFgZY	1581	1594	Thank you so much. Question or comments from the committee members? Seeing none, thank you so much, you have swayed me since the transportation committee. This bill, we have a motion and a second. This bill's out on our A roll call. Thank you so much.
7286	Hertzberg	Robert	99	dSqmLCv394A	249	269	It's this or standing silent and I think as indicated by the professor, The standing silent doesn't really see the goal, and this is one step along the way. And it will be unfortunate litigation costs in the process, but that's just the way it is as everybody tries to test what that standard reasonableness means. So in support of your bill today, Mr. Gatto.
7287	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	HgBIr1hupMw	445	467	And there are estimates that over 300,000 children are now waiting and eligible for childcare subsidies statewide. 300,000. What do we do with these children? So even with some additional slots in the 2014-2015 budget, California is still only meeting 18% of its childcare needs.
7288	Leno	Mark	60	EP8eVPLyUZg	254	279	I told some of my friends they were going to sit down and watch this with me. They said, a 90 minute documentary on toxic flame retardants, but it is a fascinating tale with a lot of drama. Much of it caused by a Pulitzer prize winning investigative report by the Chicago Tribune, which looked into this and exposed all of the lies of the chemical industry.
7289	Pan	Richard	96	5xjBSsaNwEY	1391	1406	Thank you, thanks very much. I think in my mind, this is a very important bill. We need to, as I think it was testified, that to help people quit, this is not only gonna help their health, it's gonna help financially as well.
7290	Hill	Jerry	66	en7JgK3RrhY	76	97	Californians deserve an alternative to sitting in traffic, every day, on their way to work. This bill will reduce traffic, reduce pollution, and create jobs. If we look at last month's cap and trade auction as an indicator for this fiscal year, we'll likely to have about a half a billion or $500 million more than the Department of Finance anticipated.
7291	Leyva	Connie	62	_JbASqkciSI	165	188	Good morning, Mr. Chair and members of the committee. Thank you very much for hearing me today. I'd like to thank the Chair and the committee for your work on this bill and I will be happy to accept the proposed amendments. SB 334 is about making sure that our children can drink clean, safe water at school. This bill will ensure that water is adequately provided on school campuses and that it is safe to consume.
7292	Pavley	Fran	104	OXbgpLHoC3w	37	52	We're looking at obstacles and challenges. I think, Bob, you put together excellent, a group of panelists that's very instructive. It's very timely. Recent legislation relating to stormwater and how we look at it.
7293	Cooley	Ken	45	mNyHP9HDpqk	85	99	received by the Secretary of State, the Advanced Healthcare Directive will be copied and faxed to the inquiring party. So it's sort of a paper based system that's gotta go through some hands to get this out to the people inquiring.
7294	Brown	Cheryl	13	p1klb1Rl5Zc	280	301	I'm not quite sure everything Department of Finance just said because at the end she said that it would be mitigated by them not being in the nursing home. So I don't know why we have a problem with this. This is to give seniors a choice. Do you want to go into a nursing home or do you want to receive your care at home?
7295	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	GC6hApRO4Yg	525	542	We're going to now go back to some of the items that were not previously taken up. File item 80, file item 80, which is Senator Hueso's measure. Mr. Secretary, please read file item 80.
7296	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	QF0xTMWqn0g	386	410	What about the areas where we're now seeing, where they're injecting, that there's a concern about the potential for migrating water? Is that under consideration as well? Are the rules and regulations sufficient to address those possibilities? We got to protect the water supply in this state because mother nature is not cooperating with us.
7297	Mullin	Kevin	31	6nzz0SRNk10	781	791	All members vote who desire to vote, all members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. Clerk will close the roll, tally the vote, ayes 67 noes 0. Measure passes.
7298	Leno	Mark	60	0sKrxcyZVQA	2021	2069	All right, so we do have a few votes to come back to, to pick up the Senate votes on the motions on the earlier pages on transportation. But as announced at the top of the hearing. We're gonna move next to Public Safety, Judicial and Labor. Thanks. Ready to go?
7299	Lara	Ricardo	107	w8RK3-qsxL8	336	355	And I stand, I stand before you as a U.S. citizen, a proud American, and a California state Senator. I share, you know, that this is the best country in the world. And this is the most powerful state in the union. We are also the most diverse state in the country. Those two things are not mutually exclusive.
7300	Thurmond	Tony	4	86lIew9ia6A	1313	1332	You know, there are many worthwhile proposals, and only so much resources the administration ultimately felt five million was the right place to start this program. In terms of it not being focused on naturalization assistance the focus instead on the legal assistance for obtaining the, the DAPA, DACA status I would, I would make two points.
7301	McGuire	Mike	93	LuelkxPlWfo	106	124	And, I believe that homeowners should be able to rent their home for short-term vacation rentals. And, I believe that the new sharing economy comes with many benefits. This discussion today shouldn't be about, is this sharing economy good or bad? The sharing economy is here to stay.
7302	Hancock	Loni	98	RplCDWdFT8I	1623	1651	There might be some places that would set rules. That might give the ACLU even more concern than this bill, and I would hope that you would continue the dialogue as well. So having said that, I will support the bill, and please read through, oh, do you, would you like to close, Assemblyman Quirk?
7303	Wieckowski	Bob	55	Hfoe3X0tet8	863	878	Okay. I'm gonna stay off this bill because, as pointed out in the analysis, everybody vote their conscience. There is a motion do pass to appropriations. Please call the roll.
7304	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	xbFtMrlj2T4	1133	1147	We've got to rethink the way we live as Californians. And so, that wouldn't be a reasonable restriction, because you can't prohibit replacing a lawn with this synthetic grass. Now, what type?
7305	Cannella	Anthony	61	_3f-5R48ZaU	591	608	So in 2010 when the gas tax swap happened that moved the weight fees to pay off the debt, the general fund was $93.5 billion. Today, our general fund is $115.4 billion, roughly $22 billion higher.
7306	Olsen	Kristin	15	_b18tzFsHIo	1078	1092	Having nothing to do whether sex education is appropriate in our schools. I'd remind this body that it was just a couple of years ago that we jointly on I believe a unanimous bipartisan support, passed the Local Control Funding Formula
7307	Wolk	Lois	94	0JAWKMIHR6Q	1290	1306	And if they don't, then the state needs to do it for them. And that's what the legislation said. So an opportunity at least for two years. All right, let's move on to the CEQA exemption for drought mitigation.
7308	Weber	Shirley	44	7i9bh_kaYv0	679	694	We're not requiring it at the other levels, so we're just trying to make sure that this is the line, that there is no break in our children's education, that we're not skipping some things and finding children later on struggling in first grade and second grade when their peers have mastered the skills that are necessary.
7309	Frazier	Jim	114	KzIfF7fCyGE	2173	2188	This bill establishes a baseline set of requirements that charter party carriers, including TNCs, must follow. Nothing in this bill preempts TNCs from incorporating a higher standard into their business model. And I applaud companies like Uber and Lyft that have set up sophisticated systems to check on drivers and allow
7310	Ting	Philip	30	l3Ffe0dfTvk	488	508	And I don't think they're as sympathetic or empathetic that, in, where they don't have access to that tool, how, how are they asked to shoulder the burden? To pay somebody $265, $245,000 a year. I don't think they think that's very fair, so, so again,
7311	Maienschein	Brian	84	X4Bkp9BrIdE	1381	1406	So that's been the case yesterday, today, and tomorrow. That's not what this bill talks about. This talks about making data, for example, on how many arrests there are for quality of life, misdemeanor issues of homeless people in the city of San Diego. That's an example. How many times a chronically homeless person visits an emergency room.
7312	Chu	Kansen	32	yAgUQvRrkrQ	1289	1316	Thank you Speaker and members. With a heavy heart, I also rise to adjourn in the memory of Officer Michael Johnson. I met Officer Johnson a couple times attending the graduation of San Jose PD for the new cadets and also many of the promotion ceremonies.
7313	Campos	Nora	76	yAgUQvRrkrQ	1267	1284	San Jose and our state of California lost a great man Tuesday night. We lost a hero who made the ultimate sacrifice. Please join me in adjourning in his memory.
7314	Wagner	Donald	88	4sq_B6zlasQ	321	340	the problem is that the bill may not actually get us there for two reasons one is that the effect will necessarily be longer ballots in those jurisdictions that now we're forced to have their local elections at the same time as a primary
7315	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	oyGJSKS61pM	722	731	The bill is on call. With that we'll move to your second bill Ms. Garcia which is file item number 12, file item number 12 is AB881 I believe.
7316	Eggman	Susan Talamantes	73	Gnpfbx52n0w	500	511	AB 1193 will encourage counties to discuss treatment options with those individuals with a severe mental illness, who would ordinarily qualify for an Assisted Outpatient Treatment program if one were available.
7317	Gomez	Jimmy	80	E5Lv9C_D3vg	839	860	from purchasing coverage through a state health exchange, in order to allow such persons to purchase coverage through the California exchange using their own financial resources. Do pass as amended to add a coauthor. B roll call. SB 12, Beall.
7318	Gomez	Jimmy	80	4tou47dRNaA	566	580	businesses still don't have the capital to make those improvements, and this is one way that we actually do something for a small businesses. We have voted for so many different things for the large corporations here in Califonia epecially right here on this floor,
7319	Wieckowski	Bob	55	GChQsueBjgw	1419	1436	It wasn't that did the physical abuse or you that did the sexual abuse. You were just negligent as a parent.  I'm worried that some of the goals that you're getting may be missed if you don't open it up to all of the sixteen exceptions.
7320	Lara	Ricardo	107	YfyxpSh_BfE	1162	1181	I do agree with the LAO that this is just another program to tackle onto our community colleges. Why couldn't we already put it into the students success report, student equity and institutional effectiveness intiative, and I also do question the $60 million earmark.
7321	Gomez	Jimmy	80	E5Lv9C_D3vg	880	915	SB 19, Wolk, physicians. Physician orders a life sustaining treatment pilot registry. Do pass as amended to narrow registry to a pilot conducted by the emergency medical services authority. A roll call. SB 23, Mitchell. CalWORKS, repeal the maximum family grant. Repeals the maximum family grant or family cap rule under the California work opportunity and responsibility to kids program.
7322	Hill	Jerry	66	TMpaxPF85FY	693	715	But you said you acted promptly or when you saw the problem but this goes back, as the Auditor raised, that when there was system testing that should have taken eight weeks, took 11 months and that goes back years when that process was...Two years, perhaps. When that occurred, wouldn't that have been
7323	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	LNCt_q34OxY	444	467	Well, I think frankly because we're really trying to get consensus on this and we're not trying to ramp anything through for anybody because the goal is to find areas of common agreement, so I frankly would be very interested to see whether simplifying definitions of infill would be something that both sides or there aren't both sides; they're all sides.
7324	Mitchell	Holly	64	7Nve54D7sWM	2074	2086	You okay with that, Senator Stone? We'll take action, okay. And if we need to break them up, we'll be happy to do that. We can break them up, that's fine. Let's move on to item number 4,
7325	Leno	Mark	60	LNCt_q34OxY	418	444	Having just participated in the hearing that we had prior to your presentation of the bill, among the things that we learned was that there could be some benefit to simplifying infill exemptions and I know you said this was not going to be an omnibus bill for CEQA, but might there be some consideration or should that wait for another bill introduction altogether?
7326	Grove	Shannon	77	G-cKeAHj51U	2204	2225	So, it broke my heart to watch the movie Selma. It breaks my heart to think that our nation ever did anything like that, but I think that the correction that has been made, we have a black president, several high ranking officers in elected office.
7327	De Leon	Kevin	102	mvgLH-ItAXY	68	94	Okay, fantastic. We got a 4-0 and Ms. Fuller will be coming. We will keep it open then. Right now, let' go to file item number two, that is a Mr. Patrick W. Henning Junior, the director of EDD. Mr. Henning, please come forward. Welcome. Thank you very much.
7328	Gordon	Richard	117	xdTTK0YoutY	1988	2008	won a case, you got called into his office and immediately offered a glass of whiskey and a toast to cheer your victory. Keith Sorenson had an incredible spirit, someone who I will deeply miss and I value his life of service to the County of San Mateo.
7329	Cooper	Jim	21	zsI5W6gUO4I	44	60	Philosophically, I've got a problem with that. And to sit here and say when people are fined, they're paying fines, they're convicted, that no one did anything. Coming from law enforcement, I hear that all the time. So it doesn't mean you still haven't done something. I mean, there's plea bargains, negotiations.
7330	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	54O2UbeLCuE	337	351	Thank you. Seeing no more witnesses, are there any members of the public that wish to speak in support or opposition? Seeing no members of the public. Any of the committee members? Wish to comment Mr. Thurmond?
7331	Irwin	Jacqui	16	gTAQdo8pMME	488	506	It is in this extremely costly housing market that VHHP operates to help California veterans by expanding the supply of rental housing. The work that VHHP is doing is critical and it is clearly aligned with the President's goal of ending veteran homelessness.
7332	Nielsen	Jim	68	H5As3s88-Eg	267	285	It's a very good bill and it will help the constituents that we represent with their frustrations getting through the morass. I'd love to tell you a story, but I'm going to do that in person. I would ask favorable consideration and a due pass recommendation.
7333	Gipson	Mike	28	bn5R6N5l4NI	945	967	Under current law the legislature provides public safety employees healthcare coverage for injuries and health conditions that links their job, and their work, to their working performance. Our laws also provides that each employee may be challenged around these claims.
7334	Hertzberg	Robert	99	nkFf3IHgULc	2174	2195	But that being said the truth of the matter is, I know anecdotally, that car manufactures do engage in behavior that has a chilling effect on dealers. And it's not right and the dealers are scared to death that they're gonna lose or have adversely effected, the old story of you order a bunch of green cars, you get a blue car.
7335	Hill	Jerry	66	oqt8nfX8ybk	121	137	When this practice was challenged as a violation to the Bagley-Keen Opening Meeting Laws, the PUC hid behind a law made for rate decisions to argue that, unlike with other state boards and commissions, only appellate or a Supreme Court could hear such cases.
7336	Lara	Ricardo	107	qTf-RqJKEFo	122	147	Furthermore the state reimbursement process for administering Grant awards under the IRWM program has been less than timely for grant awardees.  Whenever the processing of the IRWM Grants is delayed as it is sometimes the case, the delay disenfranchised communities and groups that the groups that can least afford it.
7337	Hertzberg	Robert	99	nkFf3IHgULc	2158	2174	Maybe the way the slice is a little thinner. The truth of the matter is you don't have to produce as indicated in the amendment, actual knowledge of a murder. You only have to have beyond a reasonable doubt and the strictest scrutiny. What's an actual knowledge standard?
7338	Rendon	Anthony	120	I-QYiGvetYs	1690	1748	Thank you, very helpful. I'm not sure when in the afternoon you, all three of you arrived. But we've been looking at different reform bills in this committee. Downstairs, I had another bill, 1023, there's a good five or six bills. I have two, Mr. Leto?, Mr. Hueso?, Mr. Hill has one as well. To the extent that you're aware of some of our efforts, do you think we're on the right track, are we missing some points? And also, and this is a separate question, just as important but from the perspective of, Of a group of legislators who are very much interested in providing oversight. What advice for us do you have? So, again. Two questions in terms of legislation, but also in terms of long-term oversight. What are--What are we missing out on? What do we need to be doing?
7339	Leyva	Connie	62	cXnV6IOLWSg	788	820	This is in the heart of the Inland Empire and very much-needed. This model uses value or congestion pricing to manage traffic demands throughout this corridor recent amendments have been technical in nature and clarify Cal Trans role in the project. Members, I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
7340	Gomez	Jimmy	80	CoRx3ywt_ws	1597	1615	Yep. Mr. Chair and members, today I'm presenting Assembly Bill 88, which aims to maximize amount of rate payer funds used to provide energy and water efficient appliances to low income Californians. This bill would provide a sales and use tax exemption for energy and
7341	Quirk	Bill	23	7lW2Se-ok-I	492	503	Excuse me, could we turn off the light that's shining right on that screen? Somebody understand where the lights, yeah, if you could figure out which light to turn off.
7342	Lara	Ricardo	107	kjbtobUTSlE	98	124	A quorum is present. Members, would  the members and our guests beyond the rail and in the gallery please rise. We will be led in prayer this morning by our Chaplain Sister Michelle Gorman, after which please remain standing. We will be lead in the pledge of allegiance to the flag by Senator Nguyen.
7343	Leno	Mark	60	qjDm_sZ-lfo	1556	1571	Your concerns with the bill, as you're doing today in the policy committee, judiciary committee on the assembly side. Was your presentation much different there? The reason I'm asking is the bill's in the second house now. And I just wanna make sure that as we continue to move this forward,
7344	Weber	Shirley	44	NTCK9Uu4-ME	44	55	Some of you may be aware that last over a year ago, after an incident at San Jose University. The speaker of the assembly, John Perez, created, select committee on campus climate.
7345	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	h4u4YccC9Z8	611	631	Yes, having chaired this committee in the assembly a long time ago, thank you for bringing these bills. This is just an incredible problem in the state where water is such an amazingly scarce commodity, and I'm glad to see that efforts are now being made now to address this issue.
7346	Pan	Richard	96	7ULUe19PTjQ	1473	1487	And you may create a situation where you actually hold up the trial because they're having difficulty recruiting because people say I want to go the other way. So, hopefully we can try to address this issue as well if this bill moves forward.
7347	Ting	Philip	30	Q9Mn4k8Lves	370	394	These laws are just trying to make sure that we are act a little bit more like any public agency, such as any open space advisor committee in any of our cities, having minutes published, having more public commentary at these meetings, as well as making sure that community colleges who do get put on penalty, actually have a right to appeal.
7348	Leno	Mark	60	0ONi8JCQxHk	231	246	Let me start by saying that I agree to accept the amendments suggested in the analysis clarifying that the natural person exemption may cover more than one person, and also covers living trusts.
7349	Bonta	Rob	85	oZrbKv34-B8	1130	1146	We've also included language throughout the bill that says, to the extent this chapter does not interfere with or violate the Compassionate Use Act to make clear that we are honoring the Compassionate Use Act, and acting in spaces where it doesn't go.
7350	De Leon	Kevin	102	-v1uD0LX8sQ	1530	1548	The off ramps are the following. If clean power is too expensive, if it doesn't fit the utility portfolio. If you have grid issues or you have actually increased rates. You have an off ramp to seek a waiver and bell out.
7351	Dahle	Brian	47	koHjdiMmBME	109	122	Financing at the county level is very difficult to, Prop 218 allows you not to go out without a two thirds vote. It's very difficult to get those plans implemented and this is a common sense bill that will help bring that over into the SIGMA process. Thank you for bringing it over.
7352	Nielsen	Jim	68	oyj26fO_o0A	497	523	Thank you. One of the key elements is the empowerment of the parent and these programs that we're referencing in the bill, do they help identify where the parents can have more authority, more responsibility for themselves and their families. The self esteem aspect of it.
7353	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	Bt_iuqXFo8w	217	234	Informally, John was a key advisor to Governors Davis, Schwarzenegger, and Brown on school finance issues. He had a sharp intellect, a keen sense of humor, and above all a passionate devotion to public education and the students it serves. He is missed but always remembered.
7354	Quirk	Bill	23	2vYcwmo23_E	157	182	Thank you Assembly Member. Thank you very much chiefs and Mr. Alikhan. You illuminated a lot for us here and gave us a lot to think about and this will be influencing what we do with the legislation that comes forward. So thank you all again, really appreciate you being here.
7355	Hill	Jerry	66	zxLOq1Ec94c	18	31	Today is the second day of Sunset Oversight Hearings, the Committees are conducting this year. These hearings are part of the Committees' ongoing responsibility to exercise oversight of State Agencies under their jurisdiction.
7356	Brown	Cheryl	13	y0sIqVkPves	189	209	Long-term care financing is not a topic that can be solved, or even understood, in the two-hour hearing. I have asked that my legislative colleagues join me in a multi year effort to identify and address one of the most vexing issues confronting us today.
7357	Lara	Ricardo	107	aItBzVMycEU	983	1006	But I asked the environmental movement, let us determine what our priorities are in our community. These funds are important and just as we talk about capital funding, it should go to these communities as it was intended, not to be divided among the state for everybody's pet project.
7358	Daly	Tom	118	NEf6zh-NPIY	170	198	Great. Thank you. We will go to now the remaining parts of the agenda. The consent calendar includes eight items, today. Are any questions on the consent calendar items? Questions or comments? If not, a motion is an order on the eight items on the consent calendar. There's a motion and second. Roll call please.
7359	Hertzberg	Robert	99	CKAXbjP6mGQ	1087	1110	One: Reduces GHG's which we know have an impact on our posterity, our highest calling. Two: it does what is essential for our California economy. It domesticates energy production and by domesticating energy production in a globalized world it means localized jobs.
7360	Chavez	Rocky	83	GcMV__uVRbo	969	988	So the four components, if I remember right, was obviously the money, it's your staff, your people, so they're adequately trained and the profession goes up. It's the customer, in this case it would be the students, so the students are receiving the quality education they want, and then it's the process.
7361	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	lkVCXXoPpBw	357	378	Here today and testify in support of AB 708, is Bill  Allayaud, the California Director of Government Affairs for the Environmental Working Group, Alva Aguilera, a domestic cleaning worker, and Dr. Larry Weiss, the founder and former chief chemist of the company Clean Well.
7362	De Leon	Kevin	102	FHGwb8kBog8	1172	1180	And even with those individuals who may be holding back, I feel the  sense that we believe in you as an individual, you know, and we understand and recognize what you've inherited.
7363	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	g595lZYQYE0	763	777	AB 349 ensures that they have the right to alter the landscaping on their own residential property to better conserve water by replacing grass with artificial grass. Homeowners who pursue conservation should be recognized and encouraged, not sued and fined.
7364	Hall	Isadore	1	dUxLQJsTkyU	134	158	And so again, I'd like to thank, all of you for your participation and for the due diligence placed in bringing this to where we are today. We'll start, if you will, with Mr. Dhillon, the Senior Advisor for tribal negotiations from the administration. So, Mr. Dhillon, good morning. Thank you for being with us today, and you may begin.
7365	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	qhIgiujuUww	764	785	Thank you for the information on body cameras, and investigative records, and hopefully, you can keep us abreast of what that is, how that's proceeding. But also, I don't think, I'm from the LA area. I don't think I got that information that you said you gave out to all the LA area Assembly people, so I would like to get an-
7366	Bonta	Rob	85	m48b5iZN1Uo	173	197	And to be honest, we're also gonna have a rally today as you all know. So I'm very excited and inspired to be a part of that. Looking forward to that event later today. And we'll continue to discuss throughout today and at that rally the state laws and policies that we are promoting and have work to support already to help our Boys and Men of Color to reach their full potential in work and school and in life.
7367	Beall	Jim	92	R_3K0Lk1jA4	1315	1329	Everybody at the table's spoken, we have people that would like to speak opposing the bill. Please come to the microphone thank you. Yeah, Senator, yeah that's good. Okay, go ahead, please. Yeah.
7368	Cannella	Anthony	61	XSL2yLxKUCc	302	316	And San Bernardino County is one of the counties I represent, and when I first was elected, it was a situation where they would, county roads for the most part, very rural in nature, and they would go harvest whatever crop they were harvesting and the CHP would ticket them every time they went into the road.
7369	Liu	Carol	63	oXNKeIzrJ6c	739	751	Thank you very much. Any others in support of the bill? Is there opposition? The committee did not receive anything in writing. Any questions for Assembly Member Holden? Dr. Pan?
7370	Wagner	Donald	88	SHuB-iUXJvo	639	657	they won't let you leave the last day of trial without taking the documents. So it's not true that all the paperwork's with the court anyway. Even if it were, I don't know a single process that allows me to go get a discovery from the court. I'm gonna have to depend on the court to voluntarily turn this stuff up.
7371	Beall	Jim	92	nlURi31-KJY	1563	1578	Yes, I'd like to speak in memory of Dan. Dan and I worked together for over a decade on county issues when I was a member of the CSAC Board of Directors and, Chairman of The Urban Counties Caucus.
7372	Lara	Ricardo	107	qbKF38sndDw	1444	1457	5 to 0, that item is out. Moving on to Assemblyman Roger Hernandez. AB 621, drayage truck operators. Do pass as amended for author to streamline the procedure for the program and make clarifying changes. We'll substitute the roll from AB 2.
7373	Leno	Mark	60	6KgzpeS3bCM	416	431	they prefer not to be reviewed and as we've seen, this is not conjecture anymore, we all took a leap of faith in the passage of our bill in 2010 in review for the individual and small group markets
7374	Rendon	Anthony	120	pqf8UezhQwo	1318	1327	I remain committed to addressing these issues. I appreciate the time the stakeholders have also committed to considering how to resolve these issues as well. I ask for your aye vote.
7375	Roth	Richard	106	1XQMI2ofb7Y	203	218	I think we're transferring a huge burden from people up here who were supposed to be able to predict and manage things to very small school districts throughout the State of California.
7376	Monning	Bill	25	YaizxSy4_NU	1177	1192	Thank you madame President. Under motions and resolutions, I request unanimous consent to submit a letter to the journal for SB 475. This request has been approved by both sides of the aisle.
7377	Block	Marty	59	plFZ8bCzfMQ	0	22	And at this point we will have our second set of public comments. And again, just as in the past, I want to ask you to restrict your comments to one of the four-- one of the three topic areas we just covered, either the federal CCDBG grants, or state preschool oversight as we discussed, or the Head Start Partnership grant.
7378	Alejo	Luis	9	3I7f3vKVAeA	222	242	Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I also rise in support of SB 350 by our President Pro Tem because California deserves clean air, clean water, but we also deserve a sustainable energy path forward that considers the plight of disadvantaged communities.
7379	Beall	Jim	92	nrJtkVtsuec	1413	1440	And it seems to me that the intercity rail projects are kind of orphaned a little bit. And this would allow those kinds of projects to complete the project quicker and have a full project. Like if you're going from San Diego to Los Angeles for example, why does it go a little bit and stop and then you have a little bottleneck section?
7380	Cannella	Anthony	61	zgKkKMVKglc	648	658	Very high threshold, two thirds. And so I think look, if two thirds of the public decide they want to raise taxes, by golly they should be able to go as high as they want. So, but thank you for taking on this bill.
7381	Nielsen	Jim	68	TbimRTTdSU4	1258	1267	I think that's what this hearing is accomplishing, a much greater scrutiny, I think that's what your testimony is accomplishing, sir. I would look at that as being helpful.
7382	Cannella	Anthony	61	zgKkKMVKglc	634	648	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Hill, thank you very much for bringing this measure forward. I represent Monterey County. I know that they're close to the cap, so this will give them the ability, again, to let the public vote on whether they want to increase their taxes.
7383	Baker	Catharine	74	9mjyTPfbhPw	1587	1606	This bill is about those who are in the final days and hours of their life. They are going to die, and whether or not they will die painfully, suffocating, drowning, starving, or will they die with a peaceful, safe option? And I find that completely compelling.
7384	Beall	Jim	92	hQoyRwEukvY	1036	1049	I think the cap and trade money, we ought to definitely spend more money on transit. And I even heard Senator Canella talk about the ACE train is something he was concerned about.
7385	Quirk	Bill	23	bgIZ8epTm-I	1053	1091	In San Diego it's probably gonna be much harder than it will be for say, PG&E  in the central valley, but it will be difficult for PG&E on the coastal communities as well. So, none the less, though, there is an off ramp for this, and given that there's an off ramp, is there some other way that this off ramp could be, developed so that you would - . Boy, it's really strange when people open the doors. Is there some ways this off ramp could be developed in a way that you and perhaps the investor owned utilities, could then support the bill?
7386	Mullin	Kevin	31	cKW0dtBGGXY	1598	1617	Are we layering on top, where it may confuse that underlying regulatory process, if you could just sort of address that, or if the proponents could address that, and the second question is, just from the consumer side, I am all for getting consumers as much information as possible.
7387	Salas	Rudy	34	IEHFBfAx3rE	1112	1120	I do look forward to working with you. I am prepared to support this today, and look forward to continued discussions as we move on to the next committee. Thank you.
7388	Morrell	Mike	51	m_1fhqTgwb8	316	332	And, lastly, I look forward to the governor's proposal and, again, hope that what we can do is return control to the local municipalities and let parents and teachers and the school boards make those decisions at the local level. Thank you very much.
7389	Pan	Richard	96	KTS25NPAjyE	1849	1867	Or I'm gonna take advantage of this law, so I can definitely get the drug, assuming the supply is available. And then, that inhibits the ability to actually complete the trial, so we'd actually know. And that should get the drug approved. So, I think that, and I know you've attempted to address this and the committee attempted to address this.
7390	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	qjDm_sZ-lfo	1481	1504	If we would, if there were some directions given these lawyers would come out and they would do their work. And I would also indicate too that it is very common practice in the practice of law to take a retainer for services to put in a trust account that you cannot draw on until those services are rendered. That's a model that is used in the practice of law and has been for years.
7391	Mitchell	Holly	64	-t-fzOOeiys	913	925	Senator Monning? Finance or LAO? Public comment on this item? Okay, it's our recommendation that we will hold this item open. Thank you for the presentation. Item 11. Healthcare reform workload extension.
7392	Nielsen	Jim	68	TZ3CNB06_OE	559	581	And if that consequence is deportation, again, so be it. But I realized that we needed to have an opportunity for them to face consequence and that was beyond what the state could do, so I went to work with Congress in the 1996 Immigration Reform Law to gain a provision.
7393	Leyva	Connie	62	8ENPCPUYlKU	1191	1207	SB 673 corrects this disheartening trend and ensures that every community, including our most disadvantaged, have a voice and are granted the respect and the protection that they deserve. Again, I thank the Senator for bringing it forward and respectfully ask for an aye vote.
7394	Daly	Tom	118	Ezi_nx0zhx8	413	433	Thank you Senator Stone. There's a fundamental concept at work here that I believe very strongly in and that is when there's public money being spent on a public works project the workers should receive a fair day's wage for a fair day's work.
7395	Wolk	Lois	94	iZciv2kSkT8	22	41	Thank you Mr. Chair and members. First of all, I wanna thank the Chair and staff for their attention to the bill and their suggested amendments. I agree to take the amendments that regard the definitions of energy efficiency, market transformation and resources acquisition on page three of the analysis.
7396	Nazarian	Adrin	36	Y_NLzMPyU6M	717	750	Thank you for the question and those are things, issues that we discussed with the sponsors as well. It's part of the reason why I took some of the amendments so that this only impacts elderly that may be in vehicles that have wandered off in their vehicle, but the other issue and I'm not going to put you in a difficult spot of having Ms Young respond back to you, so I'll do the response unless if there's something you'd like to say.
7397	Hertzberg	Robert	99	3cRtgxQLQsI	518	535	Got it. I, I got it but we gotta see it. You know? Certainly Senator Pavley knows that from the last hearing. Okay. Opposition, who wants to start? We'll make room for you. Just want to start. Who wants to lead off? Okay, take it.
7398	Atkins	Toni	110	lKgPPhMwBGU	1392	1406	So, I will continue the discussions, but I don't want to mislead any of my colleagues in terms of what solutions we find because I have to, once I tell you I'm willing to do something, I have to be honestly willing to do it.
7399	Gaines	Beth	109	EgZgFkyj3MQ	1919	1939	Thank you, Mr speaker and members. Today I rise to adjourn in the memory of Krista Eberle. Miss Eberle was tragically taken from this world on January 7th when she became the victim of a robbery carjacking and ultimately murder, as she was leaving a dining establishment in Eldorado Hills.
7400	Wagner	Donald	88	R3SMzNAvRKs	165	193	They get little wrist slaps. It doesn't change the behavior of the ACCJC and has been said before they are rogue agency run amok. The policy suggestion that our side has come up with: well let's let the feds reign them in and control them. Great as it sounds, is one that has been tried literally for over a decade including by me personally.
7401	Monning	Bill	25	4INVuEQu1gA	1027	1047	At the same time, fewer than 11% of California homeowners have earthquake insurance. This is a recipe for economic disaster. SB 602 offers homeowners another way to protect themselves. By providing a low cost financing option to retro fit their homes to reduce the likelihood of severe damage.
7402	Stone	Mark	20	Ty0_iZ3tnjo	635	647	At this point in time, the amendments that we are offering had been vetted through, as I said, a wide range of stakeholders. To not take them, at this point, certainly jeopardizes the bill and
7403	Irwin	Jacqui	16	TmtzANXYgv0	1818	1836	Well, I just wanted to say as a former city council member and a member of many non-profit boards, I see the enormous benefit that non-profit charities have in our community and we don't want the poor actions of the few bad players to tarnish the entire industry.
7404	Dahle	Brian	47	td32uLu5rbg	985	998	Any other in opposition? Seeing none, we will bring it back. Questions by members? Seeing none, we have a motion and a second. And would you like to close?
7405	Thurmond	Tony	4	9UYl1IR1e0U	539	555	As a school board member I voted no every time a student was expelled. And here's why, cause typically there was no plan for how to help that student reenter the school that he or she was being expelled from, or some other school.
7406	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	HlZ2dOHrKsk	1519	1534	She doesn't want to die. She wants to live but, you know, we don't all get to make that choice. And, we see people we heard someone testify they had cancer three times and they know if they get it again that that is a a terminal diagnosis.
7407	Alejo	Luis	9	4MjmF7EnXtg	375	385	We began talking about the problems at Pinto Lake. We learned that the toxic algae blooms are increasingly causing toxic and poisoning events in coastal lakes, as estuaries, and rivers all across California.
7408	Cooley	Ken	45	NEf6zh-NPIY	1463	1474	The fact that this is employee paid, they've accumulated a surplus, we're trying to tailor the policy to people who created that surplus. I think that's a very sound idea.
7409	McGuire	Mike	93	msHMXzeLRF8	600	619	We're going to be hearing an update from each of the agency's representatives but I want to see if there are any additional opening comments from any of the members. OK, thank you so much. All right. Thank you. And again, we're grateful that you're here and please kick us off.
7410	Beall	Jim	92	84LBK3fic7E	2014	2036	But I do think we can pay back the loans, we can transfer the weight fees, we can slightly increase vehicle registration fees, the vehicle -- the gasoline tax, just slightly, and spread the cost fairly among users of the transportation system to maintain the system,
7411	Hill	Jerry	66	Q0YUSKbr_v0	845	872	In 2012, there were 28 calls to the California Poison Control System for liquid nicotine poisoning, 28 calls in 2012. Last year, there were 243 calls. At least 60% of the calls were for children five years old or younger. Finally, the bill allows local preemption. If local governments want to regulate e-cigarettes more strictly, they are free to do so under SB 24.
7412	Wieckowski	Bob	55	R5jZe-4pYBI	1677	1699	I thought I heard you say at your introduction that you were not accepting the suggested amendments on parenthesis A, but that you were accepting the amendments B, C, and D, with the exception of striking likely and adding with the potential and striking significant. Is that correct?
7413	De Leon	Kevin	102	85T-CDj8RB4	1111	1130	The characterizations of giving them a blank check are inaccurate. This is where we can work together. This is the first time, Mr. Hernandez, I've heard your comments or your concerns, very first time. But I welcome you into my office so we can engage much further in detail on this issue. So with that Mr. Chair, I really thank you for indulgence.
7414	Thurmond	Tony	4	H9-I5joylQw	1176	1191	And I gotta be honest, it struck me a little bit cuz it's sorta like, I don't ever wanna let convenience override precaution. And so let me just ask the question. How long would it take to get all the information that you need? Meaning, why not wait?
7415	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	60U_LMI0eIw	1136	1170	I was asked off the microphone if this was happening in California. The workers were talking about their jobs in California, so absolutely. Cuz they had that New York Times article. They thought maybe this was happening somewhere else. And that just shows you how far we still have to go in this state.
7416	Hertzberg	Robert	99	WnmFSvHbO0k	785	810	Senator Mendoza, Senator Mitchell and Senator Pavley an impish 31% vote by mail, 11% less than the California average. So, what are we trying to do on this thing? We're trying to think creatively. You get this little document in your in your ballot and on the back you have to, if you're not a permanent AV, you've gotta fill it out, send it in, wait
7417	Leno	Mark	60	BcOJ4WzBt0M	759	784	Senator Lara, excuse me, Assembly version and that would be. 3-0? 3-0, 3-0. On the Senate side, 3-0 on the Assembly side for the Assembly proposal. Twenty six has to do with local government financing.
7418	Bloom	Richard	2	EgZgFkyj3MQ	1817	1856	And this led to stardom, where she was on the television show, "I've Got a Secret," for nine years from 1958 to 1967.  And in 1973, she fought and survived ovarian cancer, which then led to her involvement in raising money to fight that disease. Beth Mirson's life and career was long, multifaceted  multi-faceted, and inspirational and I thank the Assembly for adjoining in her memory.
7419	Jones	Brian	42	8g5e-OGL0_Y	1085	1101	Barbara's loving husband who eventually became her full-time caregiver was joined by their son and daughter to usher her into the hands of the Lord just a few short weeks ago. Thank you members for joining with me today to honor Barbara in her adjournment in memory.
7420	Galgiani	Cathleen	95	ehjG4WNbq0w	847	869	So a property that was worth such amount at one point in time is not nearly worth that now. So I am very concerned about property owners that might in fact even owe more on their property than it would be valued at today. So what, if there is a scenario like that, how was that scenario treated?
7421	Moorlach	John	4657	DcIk90J9Qng	405	438	May I ask just one question Senator Block? It was when, when, when you reduce an expense with DGS. After they have an offsetting reduction as well. And how important is DGS? Wait, we, we decentralized a lot in Orange County, is, is that part of what's happening here? And that's all I had. I'm sorry.
7422	Gatto	Mike	46	5EeaivfMcyY	1082	1107	But the crux of this, what I'm trying to get at is, you have these companies creating or hiring people to create transcripts. The people who actually create them are licensed in California, right? They can lose their license if they don't make a verbatim transcript of the of the proceedings and that is the nature of the profession.
7423	Thurmond	Tony	4	6nzz0SRNk10	116	133	Thank you Mr. speaker and members, I would like to present 1496. Like the last bill, it ponders a conversation about climate change and the quality of air. It's a bill about protecting public health and improving air quality and reducing global warming.
7424	Gatto	Mike	46	oWaFMHsMqpI	384	401	In many cases, these injuries are entirely preventable, because if you call 911 in the first five minutes after a crime, after one of these collisions, study after study has shown that that person has a good chance of living. But if you don't call 911 within five minutes, that person might bleed to death.
7425	Mitchell	Holly	64	U9EPCHTiWm8	1773	1786	And beginning to look very critically at the process by which students are recommended for AP courses. And that it's not just a single portal, if you will, which is a teacher recommendation.
7426	Gatto	Mike	46	oWaFMHsMqpI	366	384	At its core, hit and run crimes are really, really a dastardly crime if you think about it, and one that are entirely preventable. The lack of morals that it takes for someone to leave someone to die on the side of the road. I mean think about that, think about that.
7427	Hueso	Ben	48	8_h1Rf31Czc	721	737	Thank you. Very briefly, it's a, it's a balance. It's, it's, it's, right you say if somebody's gonna walk into a store with the intent to sue, they're gonna find some, a reason to sue. It can be a crack in the sidewalk, it could be a, a, a product that they break and slip on themselves.
7428	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	3u2iEKilpPI	434	496	Thank you Madame Chair. As many of you know, I've been a big advocate of the courts and fought like heck to ensure that the trial court's get as much funding. Hopefully, you have seen the recent audit by the state auditor, which was very enlightening and unbelievably disturbing in a lot of ways. I might be one that on this panel that may be looking at doing things another way, at cutting the court budget because of some of the problems that we see in that while trial court rooms are being closed all across this state for lack of funds. We're paying about 8 managers $179,000, more than your boss the governor, more than the general manager department of general services who manages thousands of employees, which is about 800 employees, averaging about $28,000 than anybody else at that same level.
7429	Allen	Benjamin	70	YCiZz_ZRK7I	27	50	You know, registered to vote, you get a voter card... That's your national ID,it's also your voting Credencial de elector they call it. Love to get a better sense of the history and the reasons why we have a separate registration process when... Everyone knows, the government has a list of every citizen already.
7430	Linder	Eric	39	bsC6VSsjVLI	652	664	The CMGC method has been identified by the Federal Highway Administration and other state transportation agencies to be an innovative way to reduce the time and cost of a project delivery.
7431	Hill	Jerry	66	G-cKeAHj51U	775	805	Yes and I wanted to mention that at the conclusion of my statement. Due to conversations with the Chair and your tremendous staff and consultants, so thank you for that. We're looking at trying to kind of distinguish between those nonprofits that I look at maybe taking advantage of the system versus those professional nonprofits, The League of California Cities, others, The Association of Legislators.
7432	Anderson	Joel	57	_4l4q_6Hap0	1710	1720	You may have enough votes that it doesn't really matter what I think. But I do believe that getting more people online, registered to vote, is a good thing.
7433	Chau	Ed	116	UdyJhNk-vh8	1623	1643	it defines the term encrypted to mean any data which has been rendered unusable, unreadable or indecipherable through a security technology or methodology generally accepted in the field of information security. Organizations must be able to determine as quickly as possible when the data breach occurred.
7434	Chavez	Rocky	83	y1QKa01q6Wg	2208	2232	And what's happening is it's going to drive up the cost even more than it is today. And I think this bill would probably have a lot of merit when we have first, solve immigration reform, which all the Republicans have sent in a resolution this year, asking for immigration reform from the Feds.
7435	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	vpNS8YXwTNY	1917	1960	Well, are we giving up what we currently have? I mean there is some concern, not necessarily justified, but I think there's a potential argument that we don't want to give away the authority that we are supposed to exercise in the process. I just want to make sure that we are not giving up more with this program, what the ARB has now, what different regulatory agencies have I think so far has been fairly effective in terms of the goals, the greenhouse gas goals.
7436	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	itjqf4OHel4	1752	1774	And so we are talking about situations where yes, in an ideal world the employer and the employee sit down and they talk to each other. In fact, in studies that have been done where businesses provide these kinds of opportunities to take time with loved ones in particular and periods of extreme angst and difficulty.
7437	Hill	Jerry	66	ZJAG2StITgQ	1007	1038	When this policy happened, when the district attorneys and the law enforcement personnel, the armed personnel that came, the three individuals and how you were secured with those individuals, in that process and the fact that who the makeup of that team, that strike team, was that ever communicated to the board in any way? Were they ever aware of the makeup of some of the strike teams?
7438	Hernandez	Ed	103	qzvpjn8Cr2Y	1077	1091	And yes maybe make a difference in your rural areas, in the inner city, so you know, I think the only thing I can be guilty of is bringing a tough bill and I apologize for that. And Mr. Dodd, I hope I'm the last guy you heard today.
7439	Liu	Carol	63	1KGu-z0GNGc	515	535	I wanna thank the committee staff for their analysis. And I accept the amendment on page two, to add a requirement that the CTC annual report include specific action-oriented and pragmatic recommendations. I also want to thank the committee chair for your request to join me and being added as a co-author.
7440	McGuire	Mike	93	31Xp8hxYTr4	136	151	With a sworn police chief, in contracting out security and police services with local law enforcement agencies SMART will be able to reduce costs as a public transit agency while receiving all the benefits of a sworn police chief.
7441	Hueso	Ben	48	OaKXojP7k_0	911	926	from regulation now this bill will be the first of its kind. Granting a special status to this industry. There was an advisory report given by UCLA that told their employees
7442	Grove	Shannon	77	Wq4BKtQGDbc	379	397	Thank you. So, Mr. Kelly, I'm the Vice Chairman of the assembly side. So Mr. Kelly, you made a statement when you were speaking about you on voting, you would like a secure, your quote was "a secure vote by mail system", what does that look like to you?
7443	Hueso	Ben	48	OaKXojP7k_0	960	975	but we don't think it's in the best interests of University of California-Los Angeles employees to use this unregulated service because we believe are employees' lives will be at risk. This bill would tell similar departments of
7444	Hueso	Ben	48	OaKXojP7k_0	942	960	you do not use this industry because your life will be at risk. The industry responded by clarification asking them if they were going to not honor employee receipts and they came up publicly said no we will still honor them,
7445	Hertzberg	Robert	99	gnd2v7Ro_Uo	867	886	Yeah but the notion behind the redevelopment concept in the law is that it does serve a public purpose. The argument the governor makes, I think is fair. Is the sense that, look you're out there you wanna help one community, you're gonna give them the increment, but then on the flip side when the county's trying to use the money to pay for welfare or the social services, they're deprived of that money.
7446	Nielsen	Jim	68	0JAWKMIHR6Q	953	965	So I'm glad to see something in at the end of the drought emergency, but keep in mind, under the legislation last year, the governor could effectively have a rolling drought emergency.
7447	Leno	Mark	60	EkjCB3EukYI	1024	1046	through an e-cigarette. It's a choice this bill will not interfere with. And I don't think it's the place of government to interfere with that decision and there are many reasons to do so. You won't make your house smell like an ashtray. But the nicotine will still be delivered, and people don't understand that. It's
7448	Huff	Bob	105	tX-iRiZ5OnY	490	507	So if housing reduces greenhouse gas, if high-speed rail that's not electrified and not operational reduces greenhouse gas, then surely moving cars and trucks more efficiently on our roads does reduce greenhouse gases. So I would refute everything they say along those lines.
7449	Leno	Mark	60	jsGbKJLFERc	1347	1363	Very good, so that is the motion before us to take the Assembly version with some minor technical changes to their budget bill language, not to the trailer bill language, just deals with the intent language. And so, the vote will be 3-0 on the Senate side and 3-0 on the Assembly side.
7450	Stone	Jeff	26	4l5FjBTBUZQ	587	617	And, what we did see is the owners responsible that took ownership for that spill and, have undertaken an expeditious cleanup in response. This bill I think sends the wrong message about oil and gas production in the state. I've been a very strong proponent of green energy. And, I want to see our state explore ways to use new existing technologies to enhance our energy portfolio.
7451	Hueso	Ben	48	iMCgrPZ8vzk	1521	1536	And I just asked out of relation to, I always look at, you know, access to capital as a very complete program and I just thought I'd chime in terms of whether that's even been figured into the whole conversation
7452	Quirk	Bill	23	0lsNxjB7bP8	1263	1274	Again, if you want to stop particular abuses, I am open to a bill that would stop particular abuses, but I am not open to a handcuff on technology. Thank you.
7453	Gatto	Mike	46	2V6gzfYtqAs	232	256	If it pleases the Chair, so, this bill is numbered 170 ,and we introduced it in December after the big Newsweek expose came out. And we have thought about this, and my staff has done just a tremendous job thinking about the way to make this the most sensible way.
7454	Leno	Mark	60	cKW0dtBGGXY	1687	1711	Of course, with regard to the concerns about Prop 65 and the Green Chemistry Initiative. The opposition would want to presume that committee members don't recognize the difference between what we're doing and Prop 65. Prop 65, just to remind you, not to presume that you don't already know this, just addressed chemicals that cause cancer and reproductive harm.
7455	Anderson	Joel	57	iUHwS7EKP20	898	922	When earlier you had mentioned, well at least I understood you just say that any cost increase would be passed onto the consumer. I think Doctor Hernandez asked that question and you answered it. If that's the case, and we're looking at this MCO stopping a year from now, as we know it now.
7456	Gomez	Jimmy	80	JgpqDSrKaXw	384	414	Members and members of the public, I'd like to welcome you to the May 28th Assembly Appropriation Suspense hearing. I also just want to make some general comments. First and foremost, I want to thank all the staff of Appropriations, as from the Democratic side and Republican side, as well the members who serve on the committee, for all the work they've done.
7457	Alejo	Luis	9	r8pfLxI6EBY	251	262	But, the best you can inform policy-makers, and so California can do better job in supporting communities just like yours is by sharing these powerful stories, I thank you for doing that here today.
7458	Wolk	Lois	94	OXbgpLHoC3w	1056	1072	Madame Chair, Irvine Ranch has always kind of pushed the, I don't know if they're here today, but we did a bill that had to do with conservation rates and allowing the tiered rates, and that was sometime in the mid 2000s, was signed by the Governor.
7459	Liu	Carol	63	imNDOA_EHUU	676	826	And you voted for that. Okay, so you're done and I will see you again in the committee in June. Thank you. Two minutes. Welcome back, thank you. Let's start from the top. I think we ned to do that. Item 1, SB 210, Galgioni.
7460	Block	Marty	59	AuGnonUgy28	896	914	Well, I guess as I said yesterday, the budget sub-hearings are really the final step for the subcommittee, but they're the first step really in the budget process. There will be a full budget hearing on Friday.
7461	Gray	Adam	27	U78_h0h7YJE	206	224	Okay. And with that I think we'll begin with our first presentation, an overview and historical perspective of earthquakes in California, we welcome John Parrish to the podium. Thank you, sir, for being here and providing testament for the Committee.
7462	Weber	Shirley	44	dic9GH4s49g	1954	1966	You know, you have some dates and people get shifted from school to school, and I've been involved in that and it's kind of an ugly thing when you have a large district, particularly like San Diego, where you have to deal with that. So I, I, I value what you say.
7463	Mullin	Kevin	31	sR3YZBZSyxQ	610	628	Thank you, Mr. Chiu. Seeing no discussion on the item, clerk will open the roll. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. Clerk will close the roll. Tally the vote, ayes 69, nos zero. Senate amendments are concurred in.
7464	Cooley	Ken	45	Gv0uyUPdJmA	745	756	We're working very closely Secretary Dooley of the Health and Human Services agency, and they actually are trying to get the website up and running administratively, which this bill has supported.
7465	Chiu	David	7	sR3YZBZSyxQ	592	609	Thank you, Mr. Speaker and colleagues. Back on concurrence, AB 1236 will expand our State's electric vehicle infrastructure and help reduce auto emissions. Amendments taken in the Senate provide more flexibility to local governments and developing their electric vehicle ordinances. And with that, I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
7466	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	dKlfu24NXRk	869	881	I'll defer to the Secretary of State, but this actually has built in provisions that ensure that only US citizens that their information is being forwarded to the Secretary of State. Alex?
7467	Block	Marty	59	DcIk90J9Qng	28	45	The fifth item on Capitol Ali proposals there will be public comment and a vote on that and at the very end there will be public comment on any of the issues we have discussed today. With that, I'd like to call up the first panel for today. From the Department of Finance, Matthew Saha.
7468	Williams	Das	12	ES_o9sm3ARk	1009	1022	and agencies to increase adaptation rather than require them to spend funds towards it before they have identified it. and the author has accepted those amendments. With that, would you like to close?
7469	Chavez	Rocky	83	ElqG9zhDxtM	1698	1716	And as far, as you know, the federal law has a different process for contracting DVBE than California law. Two different organizations, two different laws that deal with it. In fact, the federal law right now has up to ten years. This is a change. We're going to three years.
7470	Mitchell	Holly	64	q7JaQd-cxG0	629	642	Thank you very much Mr. Pro tem. Good afternoon. I too have a good friend and colleague that serves with you, Mayor Aja Brown who speaks very highly of you. I don't have any questions and when the appropriate time is available, I'll be more than happy to move the nomination.
7471	Garcia	Eduardo	38	cnM70VeH5ZM	1294	1311	Yeah, why don't we do that.  I know I have questions.  You've raised some could points that I'd like to ask questions. I'm sure the members do as well, but in the interests of keeping the agenda moving we'll introduce Mr. Nickelsburg of UCLA Anderson Forecast.
7472	Leno	Mark	60	dCf0VaDDxwk	1016	1035	You're about to dig into it, so we can all better understand what it is, how it came to be, and what it provides our state and our state budget. So, we're here to learn, and I hope we'll all be paying close attention to the facts and the reality that is presented to us. Thank you.
7473	Huff	Bob	105	-v1uD0LX8sQ	219	245	Retro fitting older buildings is very difficult, it's very expensive. But the bill fails to recognize measures that have already been taken to make existing buildings energy-efficient. So it calls for a 50% reduction of energy use in our existing buildings with no guidance on how to get there, which means we're going to have some unelected people once again coming up with standards and things that's going to end up very expensive
7474	Bonta	Rob	85	qhIgiujuUww	998	1027	Thank you, Chair Cooper, I just wanted to thank you for your leadership in convening this meeting and hearing on this important issue. It's something that body cameras as a policy and as an issue needing funding throughout the state of California has been something we've been dealing with squarely here in the state legislature this year. A number of us on this committee have been working on that issue. And I think it's gonna be an important tool in improving law enforcement and community relations.
7475	Cannella	Anthony	61	7PzIS76lHXw	787	796	So I just want to get a commitment from you that you're going to look at the department from top to bottom, and really, even if it's with colleagues you once worked with,
7476	Baker	Catharine	74	9mjyTPfbhPw	1686	1703	And I believe that's why I'm voting for this bill. And I urge my colleagues to not force others to go through that pain, to allow them to make that choice, with the safeguards that are in this bill. I didn't originally support this bill for the last several months.
7477	Roth	Richard	106	JZLdEqkqLz4	1038	1060	Right. Which I think may be the Finance Department's concern looking across the 400 plus cities, and however many redevelopment agencies, we have in the state of California with these, I want to get to the interest rate, but with these reimbursement agreements. How do they sort through ones where they are fully documented in resolution,
7478	Leno	Mark	60	kGpKuwTOA0g	48	62	Many people don't know their tenant rights. Sometimes they have the wherewithal to get informed, sometimes, not. Sometimes they're offered five or ten thousand dollars, and they think that's better than being kicked to the street without anything, and of course, that will last them another month or two, but not much longer,
7479	De Leon	Kevin	102	SU8_KAMcIaE	910	938	Especially given in light of Kern County, Stanislaus and everything in between, the air quality is not the very best and the public health aspects, are especially cute.  So, I do really appreciate the question from Ms. Mitchell because you're not like any other member of this committee or its a de facto appointment by mere nature that you happen to be a county supervisor from a particular county.
7480	Stone	Jeff	26	VbSjp8j5tnU	1396	1410	The bill contains important protections for all parties, so that the doctor, and the hospital advising the drug, and the pharmaceutical company providing the drug will not be subjected to a lawsuit. This bill has received no no votes throughout the process. I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
7481	Mitchell	Holly	64	sFefduhHol8	666	701	Thank you very much. We've got a second panel that'll be joining us. On the Continuum of Care Program, Allison Bindel from California Youth Connection, Susanna Kniffen from the Alliance, Mr. Mecca, Welfare Directors Association, Jennifer Rodriguez, Youth Law Center. And then we'll ask the Department to return after your three to five minute presentations each, to respond to issues you've raised.
7482	Kim	Young	82	LTEBLbyRjnQ	1522	1543	I'll second that, and I do have some comment I'd like to make, Chair? Okay, great. Thank you, Senator Fuller, for bringing this bill forward. I've raised four kids, and I've been with my children in every step of the way and I've seen also the physical activities that they undertake.
7483	Thurmond	Tony	4	ljTMAR3_jHw	1685	1706	How do we, do you have any data that demonstrates reduction in services in general to those served in the developmental disability community as a result of the number of programs that have closed because of rate issues?
7484	Leno	Mark	60	OYxOD7KdZAI	1342	1364	Now, if you're having some second thoughts about voting for these bills today I suspect you will have some second thoughts about voting for the two water bills that will have on this floor tomorrow because they will be Assembly bills that they are sending over to us today. They are vehicles with for public process, I would ask your eye vote.
7485	Hill	Jerry	66	OcW4SGQXlmw	845	861	Do you agree with what I think my understanding and the auditor's assumption is, and understanding that that authority is yours, and if it is yours, have you exercised that in this particular case and in others that you're working with?
7486	Chavez	Rocky	83	NULZ8SoEhtM	32	51	Research has continually shown that the most significantfactor in a child's education is a quality teacher. Teacher training programs incorporate numerous textbooks to learn, but the hands on trainingin the actual classroom is insufficient, leaving many new teachers unprepared for the classroomonce they're on their own.
7487	Dodd	Bill	71	taVqkacMZr4	973	985	Clear Lake has already lost 79% of the wetlands that have historically surrounded the lake. Therefore, the lake has lost an important means of trapping nutrients that feed the algae blooms.
7488	Mitchell	Holly	64	2tOIPOStcDA	1367	1382	According to a 2010 Foundation study, nearly 65% of students who took Algebra 1 in eighth grade successfully, were made to repeat the class in ninth grade. Particularly students of color, Latino, Black, and Pacific-Islander students.
7489	Allen	Benjamin	70	TzXQpLlHzt8	712	731	You know, for instance maybe more inland residence from disadvantage neighborhoods travel everyday to the west side in Los Angeles and there are similar patterns going on all over the state, but particularly not areas, just to make a living. And I'm just concerned that there may not be enough affordable, I know they're not enough affordable low carbon transit and transportation options available to them.
7490	Dababneh	Matthew	50	ml_foCY5OhM	675	703	Thank you Mr. Chair. For our next panel, will be an overview of the state and federal programs to assist first-time homebuyers. We have Tia Boatman Patterson, Executive Director of the California Housing Finance Agency. Gail Hall, Director of Legislative Services Bureau Franchise Tax Board. Todd Dal Porto, Senior Director at Residential Lending Strategy & Growth at Fremont Bank. Thank you all for being here. And we'll jump straight in with Ms. Patterson.
7491	Mullin	Kevin	31	ch3qK2_FbyA	1740	1763	Thank you, Mr. Jones. As I indicated previously I ruled in favor the point of order, that the point of order was well-taken that your comments were expanding outside the immediate content of the bill before us. That is why I made that determination, and the question before the body is shall the decision of the chair be overruled. Mr. Jones is asking for an
7492	Mitchell	Holly	64	eb2YaRQ7J5Y	73	91	We think that's the most efficient way of handling public comment. Are there any questions or was anyone confused by what I just suggested? Excellent, thank you very much. We will get started by hearing from our first panel. Thank you all for coming to the table.
7493	Fuller	Jean	49	fkvme1Ux-zg	531	553	Myron Smith, and maybe give a little wave as I read your bio. Myron Smith is an EMT and the manager of Hall Critical Care Transport. Smith is the third-generation emergency medical services worker. Smith has been nominated for star of life in recognition of the many lives he has touched through his dedication to EMS Education.
7494	Lara	Ricardo	107	tIl0bzr-tVs	434	445	And I applaud your efforts to continue to remedy this, this continuing issue that continues to be a problem for a lot of us that live up and down the 710 freeway. So, thank you. Once we have quorum, we'll continue, we'll move the measure.
7495	Levine	Marc	8	9CBpVwqHDr0	1137	1161	As the Committee analysis points out, this bridge was build in 1956 with three lanes of traffic in each direction. Consequently, restoring the third lane now does not involve major bridge construction. However, time estimates for completion of this project are as long a three years. AB 157 will help speed up that process by as much as 18 months, by requiring that the design work be done concurrently with the environmental review.
7496	Gordon	Richard	117	9MQl_MfHN90	478	489	Now this legislation attempts to address a narrow circumstance where there is a practical need to share information for the organization of retired employees. I respectfully ask for an "aye" vote.
7497	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	Uu6l955bq80	13	26	I also appreciate the need to try to prevent the problem from occurring in the need for better educational opportunities for young women and men on issues to avoid unintended the teen pregnancy.
7498	Stone	Mark	20	bzJzCS8XdVc	1362	1376	Thank you. Do you have any witnesses in support? Anyone in support? Seeing none, is there any opposition? Seeing none, I'll bring it back for. We do have a motion and a second. Questions, comments? Mr. Gallagher?
7499	Thurmond	Tony	4	IRk3z3ZISoY	1761	1791	Yes, thank you Mister Chairman and thank you Senator Jackson for bringing the bill. I just cannot get past the idea that in 2015 that we still have to have these conversations. I appreciate that you brought the bill forward. Ms. Resso I want to thank you for your testimony and for your courage. I can't imagine how hard it is to raise these issues when you work at a place that is causing the issues in the first place and I want to thank you for speaking to it you know what you shared, and that you're bringing it forward.
7500	Mullin	Kevin	31	dKlfu24NXRk	1777	1802	Thank you assemblywoman for making me aware of that. I must confess, I'm not conversant in the digital plate piece of this where we've been focused on this issue for the past couple of years. I'll just turn my witnesses to see if anybody's aware of the pilot with regard to digital plates. I think our focus is the here and the now and the various very obvious sort of omission here in law, but we have an information on that.
7501	Dababneh	Matthew	50	HdobNWq7f3c	576	587	Thank you. At this time I would like to open up to questions, I would like to have you wrap up after that but if you like to respond to any of that.
7502	Mendoza	Tony	52	ewcXToh_gOY	250	263	In addition, the bill represents a solution to a problem that wa-, cannot wait. We cannot keep our communities in harms way by allowing the storage of hundreds of thousands of pounds in warehouses and fire stations throughout our communities.
7503	Mitchell	Holly	64	LrUb6Z3dcdU	1402	1414	Thank you let's move on, if you're done on this program. Thank you let's move on to your final item which is your BCP the state-wide Social Security Beneficiary Work Incentives Planner.
7504	Anderson	Joel	57	-v1uD0LX8sQ	773	787	Because meanwhile these are lofty goals. They've come at a price. They've moved people from the middle class to the lower classes and people in the lower classes to the unemployed and I think that's wrong.
7505	Gomez	Jimmy	80	2b3SgDbb8jI	943	959	Thank you, Mr. Allen for giving us that close, and we definitely appreciate that You know, every Republican bill is a work in progress, so thank you so much. This bill is out on an A-roll call. Gordon, not voting.
7506	Rendon	Anthony	120	DE6Za__0TWg	2	24	Thank you. It's a little bit after five. I want to be respectful of everyone's time, and I definitely want to get to public comment in a bit, but I wanted to ask one more question before getting to public comment. Both of you have talked about the PUC as an institution, and the the current regime at the PUC is doing some things right.
7507	Monning	Bill	25	Tf4H31hlCr4	935	955	I had a question, I think it's Ms. DeMarco in that NMT program. So, you mentioned there were certain therapies that have proven to be very useful in terms of the relation building and
7508	Leno	Mark	60	GBt-hlKdDjQ	1837	1847	I think you'll be very impressed by it. It's really amazing what they have accomplished. I'm told a few other states have already taken advantage of this Ford Foundation challenge?
7509	Hancock	Loni	98	B0PWp2aeSfk	301	332	Again, I would remind everyone that when the blueprint was released it was billed as something that would save us billions of dollars specifically, and I'm reading from the blueprint, upon full implementation of realignment the department's annual budget will be reduced by $1.5 billion through you reduced expenditures associated with declining offender populations and new efficiencies.
7510	Mitchell	Holly	64	2tOIPOStcDA	1272	1300	Again, thank you Senator Beall for raising those issues and  we will be working with the welfare directors to look at those cost savings opportunities. But, you know, to be perfectly frank Mr. Chair this is gonna require an investment on our part because we have to build a system that protects the best interest of these kids. And so I'm not gonna suggest to you that their will be zero cost. But it is ultimately our responsibility to protect them, and so I ask for your favorable consideration.
7511	Gipson	Mike	28	cmFW6p4IGdA	44	61	And so, the district attorney in Los Angeles actually went in and shut them down and confiscate and gave citations. Is that issue resolved as of yet? Or still ongoing?
7512	Gallagher	James	108	AJJV4Jngl_c	1374	1390	So there is money for the things you described. What I don't want to happen is that we start funding ecosystem restoration projects that aren't part of the storage component of this bond and I think we need to take that oversight very seriously.
7513	Wieckowski	Bob	55	7zfeQPMxSJ4	781	797	I think that the other concern is that, as where the legislation is going through and we have these-- DOGGR is looking at the wells and these aquifers that may have, you know, some fresh water.
7514	Leno	Mark	60	Ir2eiizDgdE	997	1025	They go on to say that they heat liquid containing nicotine derived from tobacco. It goes on to say that this product is a tobacco product under federal law. And then just one more. As the industry continues to grow, and as has already been noted in any number of studies in the past couple of years, the nicotine content in e-cigarettes has more than doubled.
7515	McGuire	Mike	93	1JV-wI6cFUY	361	382	And also, to the work of the Western Center on Law and Poverty as well, thank you so much for your tenacious advocacy, and you are tireless, so thank you. And, I really do believe that the conversation that this legislation has started across the state on poverty and homelessness is one of the most important that we can all have.
7516	Berryhill	Tom	54	H5As3s88-Eg	481	510	Yes, thank you, Chair, and thank you members of the committee for hearing this today. We'll try to be brief, knowing that many of you have to head out. My name is Scott Moak, I'm the executive director of the Sacramento Kings Foundation, honored to represent here today many of my professional sports colleagues around the state, Major League Baseball, National Basketball Association, obviously, MLS, USL from the soccer world, NHL here today, and the NFL as well, so well represented.
7517	Perea	Henry	33	3kfM97VupkU	2123	2161	I heard concerns about carve outs and making it harder for other technologies. I mean, look, colleagues, we do a lot of carve-outs around here, and we've done a lot of carve-outs on this particular fund. In fact, unrelated to this fund, but a bill that I ran two years ago, AB 8 specifically called out hydrogen. Hydrogen is a technology that will benefit, I think, a lot of members on this dias in their districts. It's not gonna benefit mine. There's not gonna be a lot of hydrogen in the Central Valley, but there could be a lot of natural gas, which is a great opportunity to create a better future for our communities in terms of air quality.
7518	Allen	Benjamin	70	2VqeTA_wPPM	390	398	Usually a lot of people will go out, they'll vote for governor, for President, somebody in Congress, et cetera. And then they may skip the judges and then they'll vote for mayor. Doesn't that happen a lot too, or?
7519	Campos	Nora	76	OqtPmd4MeNE	55	85	Currently what this bill do, and, and I think it is timely. The bill will extend the statue of limitations to 15 years AB 538, would ensure ample time for victims to pursue civil remedies, where an offender has entered into a, contractual agreement with the media entity for sale of their story about the crime that they have committed.
7520	Wagner	Donald	88	v8Lqd5JpuF0	1475	1494	kinda follow, followed our lead in asking that they be done there. I think is sorta unfair to then pull the rug out from under them. So the opportunity to support this bill and to make sure that doesn't happen is important, but I do appreciate your representation of, of continued working with that with CDA.
7521	Pavley	Fran	104	b4USpkALPiM	475	501	You thought we were going to take away everyone's cars lawsuits. You mentioned that, Senator McCarty. A Supreme Court decision, a waiver denied and then finally achieved by the federal government. So today, one of the arguments originally on the clean car law was, we would have one standard for California, and we want one national policy.
7522	Baker	Catharine	74	hoyJIOxa8uU	636	652	Thank you and I'm gonna put a pause excuse me if I may on the public comment for just a moment. I see our good chairman has an additional witness that I have not made opportunity for, excuse me for that. Please we look forward to your testimony and, and stay where you are in line by the microphone please, thank you.
7523	De Leon	Kevin	102	9celf0om_Bo	1124	1140	So we'll pick up at 5 and work all the way through. So file items number 3 through 19, minus file item number 4. Madame Vice Chair, do we have an- I'm sorry. Can we have a motion?
7524	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	8_h1Rf31Czc	2065	2075	All right. 5-2, that bill is out. I would like to ask your indulgence, Senator Hueso. So you have a final bill up I think that will take a little more than 15 minutes
7525	Moorlach	John	4657	xL36G7ytN6U	267	288	So that's sort of a double dip of sorts and I know that schools need bond financing to build, but why are we paying it out of our limited funds when we know we're going to get squeezed with higher CalPERS contribution rates with perhaps retiree medical increase payments.
7526	Gipson	Mike	28	r0_c68VZXFY	798	807	I think we have learned, people of Watts, and I believe, Los Angeles, have learned, in a lot of ways, not to repeat what has transpired in the past.
7527	Grove	Shannon	77	ch3qK2_FbyA	1301	1316	we think about how all of us were raised, especially my age group, we were taught about how to, you know, not use electricity in the day-time, but then gear up and use electricity at night. Like, do your laundry at night and things like that. And that makes a huge difference when they're trying to balance the energy on the grid, or make sure that there's no breaks
7528	Dahle	Brian	47	yrj_FS0kMm8	554	571	So, I would like and, I know the Chairman, I've been to his district and we've been talking about this for the time that I've been here on this committee, and I know he's committed and I will commit to you that I would be willing to try to help, legislative wise, fix the problem.
7529	Irwin	Jacqui	16	iylj0sWv7JI	1486	1507	So, thank you for focusing on the issue of non-residents and what's been happening on our campuses in higher education during some of the downturn. My sense is that the non-resident issue or problem has not been much at CalState, it's primarily been at UC.
7530	Hadley	David	40	4tou47dRNaA	299	317	lawsuits do come from a very small number of points of attorneys. The solution here is not to create a new state agency a new fund and a new draw on the taxpayers the solution is to reform the abuse of
7531	Stone	Jeff	26	npLG8Ena6eQ	590	628	Let me repeat myself. Suicide is not a crime. Anyone, in the United States of America can take their life on their own without the government saying they can or they can't do it. Government doesn't have a place when it comes to the most sensitive and critical decisions of our lives that remain private by patients and their families, their clergy, and their God.
7532	Dahle	Brian	47	GUxOzh3Wh0Q	1641	1651	Obviously, we don't have a problem with that amendment either, but when we do get down to the financial part of it, if you slice it up so thin that we don't save some of these plants.
7533	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	9BeGgNFnShg	1816	1829	Or if you could just give us a brief explanation. It's a little off-topic but this story is so upsetting that it deserves some kind of response, so thank you for your courage and stepping forward.
7534	Gatto	Mike	46	CRMwg6_WO3E	505	523	a fee. Most parents are poorly informed, if at all, about the storage and medical research conducted on these samples. Under current law, parents of the right to opt out of having their child's sample stored forever and used in research, but this information is buried on the second to last page of a 14 page pamphlet that is given to parents at a very emotional time.
7535	Stone	Mark	20	uUsytMtXn1I	27	54	Good afternoon. Thank you, Mr. Chair and Senators. I'm here to present AB 848. For we need to solve a problem with residential treatment facilities that are licensed by the state of California and the fact that they cannot provide incidental medical treatments at their facilities, under their license.
7536	Cooley	Ken	45	gGp8Cmz89Vo	937	956	very important as a counter-cyclical feature to help drive the economy, even in the midsts of a downturn. So, with this resolution we're actually saying we can call upon the Congress to do something which will help make more dollars available to California retirees. In good times and bad.
7537	Mitchell	Holly	64	gCh9-ng4HsU	781	802	And in closing, again with regard to the fiscal impact as reflected in the committee analysis, according to the Urban Institute, the study titled The Effect of Specific Welfare Policies on Poverty. The family cap policy increases depoverty rate of mothers by 12.5% and increases the deep poverty rate of children by 13%.
7538	Stone	Jeff	26	_I82MBaJ6Dg	959	977	Then just the last question is that obviously there's just a finite part of money that we have in the state to provide services and to help people find jobs. Is there any nexus between DSS and Workforce Development throughout the state in mandating, if it's not mandating already, that they're working together?
7539	Pavley	Fran	104	QnBcTK-as8k	1777	1798	My concern is as Chair of the Natural Resources and Water Committee is putting our ground water resources at risk, which in a drought, is 60% of our state's water supply. This bill, I won't go through the three reforms because that's not what you're primarily concerned about, but love to talk to you at a separate time to learn about this bill.
7540	De Leon	Kevin	102	FmUMuqWK62w	1049	1068	Thank you very much, Madame President and colleagues. We do have one last adjournment in memory before we adjourn our floor session and go back home to our districts. I rise to adjourn in the memory of a dean of Los Angeles journalism, a thirty-year reporter what the Los Angeles Daily News and that is Rick Orlav.
7541	Jones	Brian	42	xxo2ATBDxJE	1104	1117	And I do ride one of those air-cooled Motorcycles, so the, my understanding on the speeds there was some agreement on the speeds. Can you explain to me where there might be, where that might be the case?
7542	Bloom	Richard	2	xDQm4xTXlMg	1766	1786	And it is only within the last three weeks, as Mr. Wilson and I have observed. That we have an inkling of what the products might look like. And that helps us determine what the process for approval of a new product might look like. We're not opposed to coming up with a pathway. In fact, we think it's a great idea to have that pathway.
7543	Stone	Jeff	26	2afEpcU9CME	1342	1357	Doctor Ride should serve as an inspiration to us all. She truly is an American hero and her accomplishments should be recognized to the best of our ability. I would be very supportive of creating a statue and having it displayed here on the state capitol grounds
7544	Nielsen	Jim	68	0J9n2c3eCds	193	220	then suffer the burden of the cost, of the suspension. We don't forsee any delays other than this impediment right now. There are some issues of artifacts and I have met with the tribal folks. It appears that the there's going to be some resolution of that issue. Nobody seems to be, there's not an acrimonious discussion.
7545	Thurmond	Tony	4	oRmeSyrF0cc	159	172	We know that there is a tremendous amount of youth of smokeless tobacco by young people. Five hundred thirty five thousand kids between the ages of twelve and seventeen have used smokeless tobacco and do so for the first-time every year.
7546	Monning	Bill	25	qjDm_sZ-lfo	797	820	You mentioned to me the possibility of a letter to the file. That's helpful maybe if somebody's in court trying to defend themselves and show the intent of the law. But if time permits, I would rather see anything that might be specified in a letter to the file referenced explicitly in the bill. Where does the bill go from here?
7547	Beall	Jim	92	suW9diU5Tzo	1589	1609	In November, Senator Mitchell and I submitted a data request to the Department of Healthcare Services about the use of psychotropic meds for foster youth to understand the depth of the problem. From what we learned in the release of the data, we got this information so far.
7548	Beall	Jim	92	gGp8Cmz89Vo	1031	1054	Let's get behind it, support it. This particular provision of letting people have their money. They've already put in Social Security essentially. They've already put their money in and now they just wanna get their benefits that they earned. It particularly affects California more than most other states. So this would particularly benefit California. I urge an aye vote on this.
7549	Hancock	Loni	98	LCBofa05MII	1866	1874	OK. And I like everybody to be as succinct and get to the point as possible or we are not going to be able to hear the bills today, so.
7550	Mitchell	Holly	64	FmUMuqWK62w	108	125	Sifford challenged the caucasian only clause and the PGA rescinded it in 1961. He later won the greater Hartford open in '67 and the Los Angeles open in 1969. He also won the 1975 senior PGA championship five years before the champions tour was created.
7551	Monning	Bill	25	I17DTXkdVm0	1712	1739	For treatments with the greatest risk, a second opinion from a psychiatrist must be obtained. The data is very troubling. Nearly one in four foster youths receive powerful psychotropic drugs. Of all the children taking psychotropic medications in California, 52% are antipsychotics, which have risk factors that can lead to life-long disabilities such as tremors, obesity and diabetes.
7552	Mitchell	Holly	64	FmUMuqWK62w	93	108	His love of golf despite many barriers in his path strengthened him as he became a beacon for diversity in the game. By his courage Doctor Sifford inspired others to follow their dreams. Golf was fortunate to have had an exceptional American in our midst.
7553	Hill	Jerry	66	92Qm5msEnYk	748	762	Is there any reason, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but I just wanted to keep this kind of going on track to these issues that the stakeholders, the nurse midwives have stated that their concerns have been dismissed by the committee?
7554	Bonilla	Susan	3	llrxaJMn6L0	945	959	Maybe, thank you. Maybe now we can go back and talk a little bit about the Institutional Review Board for the benefit of the members in terms on who sits on such a board and what role they would potentially be playing in what seems to be kind of a new frontier.
7555	Lackey	Tom	10	9-tqw489jZ4	1078	1097	that this is a better method to empower working families instead of raising costs on business. Studies have shown that the EITC is a proven way to reduce poverty. My district is still recovering from the economic downturn of 2008. A yes vote on this bill will help restore dignity to individuals who are working members of our society
7556	Block	Marty	59	6FS_MTpGrZk	0	27	Gravity and clarity I will have a couple of questions and the rest the Committee will have an opportunity to ask questions. First, like to welcome my Vice Chair and the Senate Banking Committee and Senator Andy Vidak to the room. Two quick questions one for the first to panelists who spoke to us Miss Molina and Mr. Leonard yes.
7557	Block	Marty	59	NlG9S3jpnwA	1635	1650	Thank you Senator Morrell. Vice Chair Vidak? Just one quick follow-up. You'd mentioned a couple times, the  five-hundred and ten complaints, or whatever. How do you inform borrowers about the complaint process?
7558	Wolk	Lois	94	SwF1WjZp4L4	518	530	Well, I'd like you to report back to us what the plans are to fill those and if there are applicants? I mean if that's just a designee, is that a designee?
7559	Dababneh	Matthew	50	bWj7FpZXUfY	20	47	I would like to present AB 160 which will stop counterfeiters of profiting from their crimes, will hold them financially liable and capture tax revenues lost as a direct result of their criminal activities. California is home to many key industries which are prime targets for organized counterfeiting and piracy, for example, the film and television industry which provides over 190,000 direct jobs and over $17 billion in wages.
7560	Thurmond	Tony	4	DunUs63qSXI	1103	1118	And I wanted to ask if either of you aware of how much or how little there has been IDA or similar programs made available to young people who have either been in care or are about to transition out of care.
7561	Dababneh	Matthew	50	gCJqYiGvi7w	424	435	We've already seen two other states, Iowa and Delaware. I don't think anyone will consider Iowa and Delaware with all due respect to those fine states as a hotbed of innovation or technology. We have Silicon Valley in our backyard.
7562	Bonta	Rob	85	Uoe2v6pAgNg	2181	2198	We've seen multi department price tags on similar bills in the past be in the multiple, multiple millions. We've also crafted this bill so that it's consistent with the data collection, collection processes that already exist.
7563	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	U75LWC7ksak	338	352	Thank you Chair Medina, if I could just add, for the audience and those listening, there are links to all the background material that we're discussing today, on all three Committee websites, so the links again, are on all three Committee websites.
7564	Nguyen	Janet	65	XBK8TgfRp6Y	505	521	Because right now, it is so mixed in, I mean I've talked to, I've gone to a lot of places and met with owners and workers in small town halls and meetings, and that's really where it is. No one really to understand what this is.
7565	Melendez	Melissa	41	aQ6aAhb2NJo	342	354	I'm happy to support this. I'm not, I didn't see anybody opposing it, so I hope it stays that way. I don't know why anybody would oppose it unless, of course, you couldn't fit in the golf cart, and then I could certainly understand.
7566	Hueso	Ben	48	TrPgAQvjTc0	1293	1308	The credit belongs to the man, or in this case the people or the woman who is actually in the arena. Whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errors and comes up short again and again because there is not effort without error and shortcomings.
7567	Mitchell	Holly	64	H96qDKzw-Aw	860	874	For a child in foster care who has been removed from his or her home because of physical or emotional abuse and neglect, having a competent and dedicated attorney is critical. A child's attorney may be in the best position to prevent other horrific outcomes.
7568	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	H8Ib2A9DciA	738	780	So anyone else in support, anyone in opposition, I note that there was late opposition by the courts that's frustrating as well so far and going to chide one side I might as well chide the other we really would appreciate to have the timely opposition so that we can give the authors of these bills the opportunity to engage in meaningful discussions but given who this author is I'm sure that he will continue to work with the judicial Council and note that they would like to see further amendments.
7569	Medina	Jose	81	bencsnxh2-c	1257	1277	Yes. Thank you. Again, I want to thank Tiffany and Darcy for coming here, for being the face of the 13,000 students that we read about in the newspapers and maybe see on television, but they have presented, you know, their real life situations to us.
7570	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	IRk3z3ZISoY	278	312	For example, a grocery out clerk who works at a store in West Sacramento, could challenge the higher wages being paid to the grocery check out clerks who are of the opposite sex and working in grocery chains in Natomas. Workers can challenges pay discrimination based on wages paid to workers during substantially similar work. This is an important phrase, because up until recently, equal was defined as virtually identical.
7571	McGuire	Mike	93	qbDN-8u61LI	1380	1390	And I will tell you, there is no reason why we would ever weaken. I think that 266 is an extremely strong bill. I think that the bill that we have right now in front of you is also strong.
7572	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	qjDm_sZ-lfo	447	473	Well unfortunately, I think, as Senator Wieckowski can probably expand on, I think this was a note of concern with the bar versus an older leadership of the bar, and the newer leadership of the bar, it's still being worked out with the State Bar, what, if any, role they have in the unlawful practice of law or the unregulated practice of law.
7573	Quirk	Bill	23	_Z7ChiMRbIg	766	806	Without some certainty that there's a purchaser, it's very hard to get a bank to loan you the money to do those investments. This would allow the state to be that purchaser. With me to testify and support of the bill are: Dr. Graham Noyes, Dr. Noyes, Executive Director of the Low Carbon Fuels Technology, Mr. Louie Brown, Legislative Representative of the California Bio Diesel Analysis. I also have an expert witness whose organization is not taking a position on the bill but is here to provide background. Mr, Dr. Colin Murphy. Thank You.
7574	Levine	Marc	8	pY9wY6wExdc	52	67	From 2009-2013, 32% of all boating related fatalities in the state involved alcohol. Here to speak in support of the bill is Corey Souzillo - no. I didn't look over to my rights. We got a few other folks here who are speaking in support for the bill. Thank you.
7575	Quirk	Bill	23	tEhMYBdIqkE	1566	1582	Great. All right, members, who would like to ask some questions? Sure, do you want to say something, just to give a little introduction of yourself and your interest?
7576	Wieckowski	Bob	55	6q5JSfST1YQ	1667	1682	They call it-- the term of heart is a woblette. You know, if you're between a misdemeanor and a felony, we call it the wobbler. But if you're between administrative and a misdemeanor it's a woblette. So we're trying not to get them into a misdemeanor.
7577	Brown	Cheryl	13	MXopMyL2hsg	200	222	Today three bills will be heard: AB 1136: Steinorth, The plastic bag ban fees charged at a point of sale, ACR 38 The Caregiver Task Force, AJR 8 The Anniversary of the Older Americans Act.
7578	Roth	Richard	106	Q9LdqK3BIlI	1032	1064	That the comprehensive plan that's developed include a rather detailed, what we would call in the military, personal action plan, regarding the displacement of employees there. I'd like to see some thought given to that. And I'd certainly like the legislature to have an opportunity to see what plan the administration has for the folks that have, in many cases, worked for years at that facility. So thank you Mr. Chair.
7579	Cooper	Jim	21	3GyLoQagQk4	17	34	And law enforcement does have a hard time hiring women and minorities and quite often it's opportunities. Look at paid academies. I went through 30 years ago, I paid myself to go through and I worked. So most folks that are going through academies, majority of academies, are putting themselves through.
7580	Monning	Bill	25	nfRac3nHOas	558	574	Isn't there a... I know you're not lawyers necessarily, but seems to me there's an equal protection issue to have to be charged with a similar crime in county A as in county B but to face differing bail schedules.
7581	Allen	Benjamin	70	pjSDFWGC8xY	1545	1562	I just wanna associate myself with Senator Wieckowski's comments. I mean we've all talked a lot about all the various needs including transit. I just wanna make sure that, as we're moving forward, we're not undermining some of the core goals that this community was brought together to discuss.
7582	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	HayxEPtHuzU	119	135	They'll know who the officers is and frankly, I suspect if we have Title IX officers who are properly trained and schools who believe they have to take this seriously. It would almost in of itself, you know, correct 90% of the problems.
7583	Williams	Das	12	FUMnQyMymrQ	1717	1739	I just was pleased number one that you were looking at it from the all of the above perspective that transit also would deserve a portion of that. I also just think it underscores how important it is that there is so much deferred maintenance. Civilizations are built on infrastructure.
7584	De Leon	Kevin	102	Kg4hNcGh7pk	1117	1143	That I will bear the truth (that  I will bear the truth) and allegiance to the constitution of the United States (and allegiance to the constitution of the United States) and the constitution to the State of California (and the constitution of the State of California) that I'll take this obligation freely (that I will take this obligation freely) without any mental reservation (without any mental reservation) or purpose of evasion (or purpose of evasion)
7585	Alejo	Luis	9	_skeu0yft7s	1813	1823	We're setting the example for the entire nation, whether it's driver's license, whether it's Senator ID Videx, resolution, calling for immigration reform, that had never happened in the history of California.
7586	Leno	Mark	60	13FyHcfWoOM	1502	1539	Thank you, Mr. Chair again. Thank you for your generosity of time. Clearly, a very important issue for all stakeholders. I just want to clean up few things that have been suggested here. I don't want to get in a debate over it, but figures that we have show that if you take the original California minimum wage adjusted for inflation that would be closer to eleven dollars an hour today, not nine dollars an hour, so I think it has lost its purchasing value.
7587	Hertzberg	Robert	99	6r30p-6PJFA	335	352	Another biomass facility's closing at the end of the year because one of the investor owned utilities is not renewing its contract. There's a geothermal facility in Sonoma which is looking for new buyers in the near term and much of Altamont wind farms remain without a contract, among many others.
7588	Huff	Bob	105	j_gGP70jLkM	488	516	Thank you madame president. I rise today to honor the birthday of one of California's greatest governors and one of the country's greatest presidents. Tomorrow February 6th marks the birthday of President Ronald Reagan. He would habe turned 104 tomorrow. It holds a special spot in our history as the only California Governor to become President. Reagan was 33rd Governor of California, served as the 40th President, and was known as the great communicator, often using word pictures to drive his message home.
7589	Pan	Richard	96	mTcFXIImlIA	549	565	95 percent from Measles, prevent the disease from spreading throughout the community. And, that is why every state in the United States, including California, has passed laws requiring vaccination for school entry; to protect our children and the community.
7590	Hertzberg	Robert	99	wHx-nZg7Thw	1017	1030	I accepted all, but one I modified. There's one that says, that they want to give a year for the Board to make a determination, and I don't want to wait that long. I'm a little bit impatient. So my theory is, if it doesn't pass, it doesn't pass.
7591	Bonilla	Susan	3	N6EhWxD1_nY	1151	1160	I just want to say that this is a district bill. These were some of my constituents that came to me with this concern. And I'm happy that you'll be able to meet them shortly.
7592	Beall	Jim	92	ajUtne5r3JM	187	211	like, sort of like the federal government does, I think we could make, you know, not quite match them, but I think it would help us also get federal, it would make us have the ability to grant programs' funds and then they can go to the feds and say, 'okay, we already got this multi-year funding source instead of giving us 100 million, can you give us 200 million?'
7593	Bonta	Rob	85	q4zBCxFsiaA	387	396	The vote count on that bill is 14-2 and the bill passes. Next is item number 13, SB 614. Senator Leno for add ons. Madam Secretary, please call the roll.
7594	De Leon	Kevin	102	LhZTpLi6UbE	1831	1841	Okay, Colleagues we are going to continue on our agenda. We have filed item number two on our agenda, which is before you on your iPads or your hard copies.
7595	Lara	Ricardo	107	XQwWN6GsS_M	309	322	Not only helping them integrate into our society, giving them the opportunity to become citizens, if they're eligible to do so. And also, help them coordinate in terms of, how do we integrate them better in our society?
7596	Leyva	Connie	62	_3f-5R48ZaU	1108	1126	I, too, come from the labor movement, and talking about CEQA reforms was something that we have not done in the past, but the fact that we're talking about this now I think just shows a deep level of commitment on many different sides to finding a solution that will help everybody in California. So I thank you for that.
7597	Daly	Tom	118	D85P8H59LjQ	80	101	Thank you very much Mister Chair and committee members.  This bill, AB 999, allows landlords to dispose of abandoned mobile homes fairly and equitably. In order to dispose of an abandoned mobile home, current law forces a manager of a mobile home park to pay the delinquent taxes owed by the previous owner. Of the home.
7598	Hill	Jerry	66	843OfhKnV14	49	65	Thank you. The SB 541 will make improvements to the transportation enforcement branch within the PUC. Over the years, the branch has fallen into disorder, leading to poor program performance and the lack of safety enforcement.
7599	Brown	Cheryl	13	96m6mcmORow	170	195	Thank you very much. Moving forward will narrow the bill to address the education and qualification standards of the court appointees who conduct those evaluations. Our only goal with this bill is to improve the safety of patients and staff at state hospitals, and I ask that the committee move this bill so that we can continue to work towards a solution. And I ask for your aye vote. Thank you.
7600	Patterson	Jim	119	P6cBeme--dw	1001	1028	But, the departure from the standard approach of having a full complete hearing before the full Assembly Health Committee really is a procedure that. provides full opportunity for people with all of these various different points of view to have an opportunity in a period of time and with ample testimony and ample notification.
7601	Garcia	Eduardo	38	9aoEJ21mmKA	1440	1465	As was mentioned there is a significant amount of attention and momentum around these issues related to energy in Imperial Valley and the Salton Sea restoration. To the point that the governor has put together a working group, a task force of different directors of different departments who will play a role in this effort.
7602	Weber	Shirley	44	9NVb2cnRnt4	641	665	I know that the governor, there has been some zero-based budgeting that have occurred in the last couple of years, some in Caltrans, with Caltrans aeronautical program as well as its legal program, so there's been some done and there may need to be more of them than that to really put us on a schedule where we are doing 8 departments, 8 major departments every year I think would be overwhelming in terms of what we'd get out of it.
7603	Nielsen	Jim	68	_ES7C4KFvkc	462	474	But with 250 or some kind of limit like that, you cannot grow programs. I think you cannot even sustain them with that amount. I do like the governor's approach a lot better.
7604	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	G-cKeAHj51U	2557	2568	I don't carry many resolutions myself but I thought that this was important, particularly as a Chair of the Elections Committee and that we would respectfully request your support here.
7605	Cannella	Anthony	61	ogaPmR_89iU	774	791	The problem is, we're capturing zero of them because they won't come here and pay taxes They'll just have it shipped away and there's the hope that if we allow them to come here and not pay the taxes on the car. That they will do other things, come to Ceres to lunch or your district for whatever they have there.
7606	Cooper	Jim	21	6gxr39Gyjlk	10	20	Good evening, Mr. Chair and members. AB 1422 as the Transportation Network Companies, it's a list of entities that are required to enroll on the Department of Motor Vehicles' Employer Pull Notice Program.
7607	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	2aR0NxdG4rc	441	453	It gives project proponents precisely the option, they don't have to do it, but if they know, and again, we generally know when these projects are going to go to litigation, they can get ahead of the curve, if you will.
7608	Jones	Brian	42	R3SMzNAvRKs	1238	1257	And I think what scares them about it, I think what scares CTA about these few for-profit companies that are operating charter schools as our a colleague from Bakersfield pointed out, is that they're operating very well and they're actually educating the kids that they're charged to educate with.
7609	Mitchell	Holly	64	31W9cfaQWLY	309	360	Neither would many of my women's caucus colleagues, my constituent former LA city councilman David Cunningham would not have served with honor and distinction in LA City Council. Many my Latino brothers and sisters and certainely none of my LGBT colleagues would have had the opportunity to represent our communities with distinction and honor if those early marchers, the 600 fearless men and women who took their lives into their hands on Bloody Sunday who were turned away by fire hoses, shotguns, troopers, and dogs.
7610	Pavley	Fran	104	oUB8meWTgiM	1006	1038	This discussion on all the money needed right now to meet those deadlines, I think may be misplaced. There's vacancy positions that could be filled while we look at the longer term pictures. And the wells that have been identified for high priority are already identified and the State Budget Board is engaged in this, so the funding and the people using some of the vacancy in others.
7611	Gray	Adam	27	FZTo8zIUL5Q	519	542	Okay any additional questions? Seeing none I would like to take a moment just to thank the folks for joining us today and providing their expertise and testimony. And appreciate your work in helping us try to craft or look at what an iPoker framework might look like. Thank you. Thank you.
7612	Mitchell	Holly	64	iQQbLXy8ddc	69	93	Our position has expressed concerns that expanding current code to allow for minor witnesses as well impinges on defendants right to confrontation and will make it impossible to adequately represent a defendant with child witnesses. Closed circuit television does still allow for a minor witness to be questioned and cross-examined. So that right is not waived.
7613	Mitchell	Holly	64	iQQbLXy8ddc	52	69	The legislation was inspired by a recent court case from Fresno, where the child of a father who was murdered in front of her was forced to take the witness stand face to face against the main who murdered her father. In fact, it was on the local news this weekend, that case, was actually closed.
7614	Atkins	Toni	110	CoRx3ywt_ws	808	830	And I couldn't agree more with the person, tax reform, who spoke in opposition about why we need to make sure there are criteria and metrics. We want success. We want to reach in and help those companies to grow and to create good jobs, and also continue to spur innovation, economic development, and jobs.
7615	Moorlach	John	4657	RToDyZa8pHM	1717	1729	-- morphs into something different. I'd like-- I like this proposal. I'm a little concerned about the labor compliance component. Maybe Senator Wolk, you could help me with that a little bit.
7616	McCarty	Kevin	22	TW1YYeO9oEI	994	1015	Thank you. Okay. Again, this issue will be held open till the May revise. Last issue is informational only. I know Mr. Ting asked to agendize this. And so we wanted to wait a second. Is he on his way back?  Okay, we'll wait here for a split second.
7617	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	TgDKGcmi03Q	385	399	So, finally, we welcome any ideas on how these select committees could be of assistance to you, those of you we are hearing from today, we really wanna focus on this issue of passenger rail.
7618	Mitchell	Holly	64	SU8_KAMcIaE	619	637	And some of the statements that were made in this document, but to follow up on what we had a conversation on yesterday, with regard to general public health and specifically children's health.  We talked about the increased incidence of asthma in your catchment area, for lack of a better term.
7619	Pavley	Fran	104	45ZR2HT6sPs	371	393	We had an open door policy working with them. I have a record of doing that. Is that, we decided the best way to do that is make sure that the State Water Board or the Air Board, these agencies that have regulatory authority over clean water, clean air, had developed
7620	Linder	Eric	39	WYVxOJwtXj8	1178	1197	Thank you. I have a question for the opposition. You know, clearly there's a charge that, that a change is wanted by, by some of your constituents, and some of the, and some of the stakeholders in the, in the community. And according to Mr. Daley, that charge hasn't been met.
7621	Monning	Bill	25	_0FvACJKmKc	319	351	And maybe I'll withhold further comments until the direction of the chair as to how you want to address these. But I think what unites supporters, but supporters with some reservations, opponents, but opponents with some reservations, there does seem to be a common threshold of, how do we create these incentives or measurements that are going to result in greater access and compliance.
7622	Thurmond	Tony	4	Hc7WoMlUJqU	782	800	Thank you, Mr. Chair. And Assembly Member I know that you're filling in for the author, but if you know has it been considered that this would also provide a benefit for the employer of not having people apply for a job that just doesn't meet their salary requirements, right?
7623	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	2aR0NxdG4rc	362	382	That works out to about .35 percent. A small number. And we've just heard again during this CEQA hearing that confirms that statistic, and I think it's important that only about two percent of CEQA projects become litigated.
7624	Bonta	Rob	85	I6IkPPhOVjM	149	171	two, ensure that the department adheres to an appropriate timeline for fixing the program, and three, determine what supports or assistance the department needs to advance it's improvement efforts. We have a robust agenda today where we will hear from the Department, the State Auditor, the LAO, stakeholders representing consumers, labor, and the nursing home industry, and others.
7625	Monning	Bill	25	Zk_K_zhn8-Q	583	605	Because again I think the status quo is not only potentially a violation of protected legal rights, there's a human rights issue here as well. So, I appreciate any help from the Administration and the LAO's office in putting a microscope on this. So, thank you.
7626	Mathis	Devon	75	FsWgeFm-Dtc	1192	1206	Mr. Chair and Senators, AB 583 will provide employment protection to members of the National Guard who work in California and are called up by their Governor in another state.
7627	Holden	Chris	78	EgZgFkyj3MQ	279	296	Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I request unanimous consent to suspend Assembly rule 118 to allow Speaker Atkins and Assembly Member Calderon to have guests and photographers on the floor today.
7628	Anderson	Joel	57	npLG8Ena6eQ	1997	2024	Now we have these powerful medications that nobody should die suffering in pain. I think that that changes the equation just a bit. I reject that we compare yesterday's medicine with today's miracle therapies. I would encourage you to work on this bill some more.
7629	Chu	Kansen	32	JqxWtsdpeUk	6	27	Good afternoon, it's about 1:35, I'm going to call the Assembly Human Services Committee meeting to order. The first line of the business is definitely do the roll call, so Madame Secretary.
7630	Hancock	Loni	98	k_l5daYZc00	892	917	I have to say that I would come down in favor of the ABA. Because in my view, a three-year limited term funding needs to allow all districts. Large, small, medium, whatever, to plan with some idea of stability. And I've experienced when I worked for the US Department of Education.
7631	Allen	Benjamin	70	gWhhKfvsU08	939	953	Just quickly, I wanted to align myself with the comments made by Senator Mitchell. I served on the school board before I got into this Board and we were constantly grappling with these difficult issues of the achievement gap and underperformance.
7632	Nguyen	Janet	65	0XEmXVzSg6Q	1452	1465	And the million civilians have died because of the war, whether starvation or being bombed because they were standing next to a bomb, this is just in remembrance of those and the history of this and that we don't repeat it.
7633	Fuller	Jean	49	Q5Q2oc0ttio	220	246	Okay, quorum has been established. Returning to item 6, SB539. Members, are there any witnesses in favor of this bill that would like to come forward? Are there any witnesses opposed? Seeing and hearing then, would you like to close? Or if-- unless there's comments from any of the members.
7634	Mitchell	Holly	64	oFD3dFY_sMo	1734	1776	And how she prepared meals on a single burner skillet. And the aha moment I had listening to her testimony, senator, is when we talk about job preparedness and getting people ready to interview and work, how can we expect that of her, when she has no safe place to safely bathe her children, prepare meals for her children, and for her children to sleep outside the elements.
7635	Dodd	Bill	71	CD2KiD3xDgY	1088	1102	AB 677 would require K through 12 and higher education institution to equip the doors of every classroom with locks that will allow the doors to be locked from the inside by January 1st, 2022.
7636	Irwin	Jacqui	16	d4pMcLnXU0U	797	824	Over the past two years, CVSO's have received $5.6 million in funding from the state budget and that has generated $546 million in new or increased funding for California veterans. That, for those of you that can't do the calculation that quickly, it is a return of ninety-eight dollars for every one dollar invested by the state. This money not only benefits California veterans, it benefits the California economy as a whole.
7637	Block	Marty	59	pmfMdqMvBTk	191	208	Okay, in that case, we will separate item 44 and have discussion on item 44 after we take a vote on all of the other items, items 1 through 47 excepting item 44. So the motion, the individual.
7638	Wood	Jim	72	ASNmI2rHU9I	1415	1429	It ultimately improved the quality of his life. He succumbed from cancer months and months later. But that weighs heavy on my mind as I look at this particular issue. This is, this becomes very personal very quickly.
7639	Mitchell	Holly	64	rD0VjcELenc	1030	1070	Moving on to Senate third reading. File item number 11, SCR 17. Senator Jackson? Pass on file. File item number 12, SJR 4. Senator Lara? Pass on file. File item 14, SCR 33. Senator Fuller? Pass on file. File item 16, SBR 138. Senator Fuller? Mr. Secretary, please read.
7640	Hancock	Loni	98	kIQkyQM4CnQ	1824	1845	Three million to the board of state and communities corrections for the Miocre Grant program, and 8 million for additional community recidivism reduction grants, and 1.5 million for the Supervised Population Work Force Training Grant program, which is Caltrans and stuff like that.
7641	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	f1-nJuHExxE	169	181	The state provisions which are based on the federal equal pay act are rarely utilized because there are so many loop holes that exist it makes it virtually impossible to establish a successful claim.
7642	Wolk	Lois	94	qTf-RqJKEFo	728	748	They're experiencing delays that were unreasonable in my view and in their view. So, we have an administratively challenged department here and I hope that this will be the first step in improving the process to get the money out the door.
7643	Pavley	Fran	104	WJQRNP9q0xQ	1386	1408	You cant, but there could be a, that's what we're looking at, if there's some language that, because part of the challenge is if these parks get built, when these parks get built, how do we operate and maintain them? And many cities are struggling with that now, so how do we come up with a financing source or a way to talk about?
7644	Hernandez	Roger	37	rNW_uEjgPtM	1390	1413	AB 621 is an important first step in the effort to modernize and improve efficiency at reports, which represent a vital component of our state and federal economy. AB 621 will incentivize motor carriers in the port trucking industry to make the right decision for the benefit of all interested stakeholders. I have with me today Mr. Barry Broad, on behalf of the Teamsters, to speak in support of this bill.
7645	McGuire	Mike	93	aV9Tl1RLzFc	904	924	In addition, as recognized by the administration last year, you have a percentage of those that are at the Sonoma Developmental Center that are the most medically fragile in the system. And would be challenged to actually move at all, in taking that into account of any type of transition planned.
7646	Hertzberg	Robert	99	X49dPLJib5g	1032	1043	And we should all be, every member of this body, should be a part of that and then we can find a vehicle to get this going and make sure that this transportation occupancy tax is collected.
7647	Grove	Shannon	77	54O2UbeLCuE	1664	1676	students who are at risk and need additionally high quality options that can help themselves achieve their academic goals are the students that we're trying to reach and create options for these parents.
7648	Mathis	Devon	75	fmIaR7hDQ6w	2231	2254	like Chairman Salas said, it's anything that we can do to help. I know back home we've done the Summit, we've done several things. But it's, the communication piece is vital because the things that we hear as legislatures, versus different state organizations, versus the guys that are boots on the ground,
7649	Wood	Jim	72	gXZO0cZqlQg	1381	1392	As work continues to progress in achieving greater broadband and expansion, it is important to continue the state's commitment to help ensure universal access to basic telecommunications such as broadband.
7650	Leno	Mark	60	EP8eVPLyUZg	292	316	To have lied to our committee, Senate B&P where our bill died by dreaming up a story about an infant that had died in a horrible fire in its crib. A candle supposedly fell over and there were no flame retardants in the crib and the child died a horrible death. He traveled from state to state, was paid significant amounts of money.
7651	Olsen	Kristin	15	d_EaaILk1VE	141	156	Frequently, the legislature passes bills requiring greater transparency of   other agencies and local governments and yet, we continue to hold ourselves accountable to the same standards of open, transparent, citizen driven government.
7652	Weber	Shirley	44	0LdXFnPqPCk	1032	1053	I'm constantly reminded of the fact that in the midst of crossing that bridge, those individuals were fully aware of the fact that they had been some death in Mississippi, that they hd killed Medgar Evers because he wanted the right to vote, that they had bombed the church in Birmingham and kill three innocent little girls in the area of civil rights.
7653	Stone	Jeff	26	ze-YP1FOzwQ	682	720	Coal is the world's most abundant and widely distributed fossil fuel source. According to helpers, they invest nearly 6.5 billion in coal and coal related companies. Helpers invest over $800 million dollars. At a time where our combined helpers unfunded pension liabilities, approximate $300 billion dollars. This is honestly makes sense divest in something that is an important  piece of our economy and energy and dependence.
7654	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	eiRf682j8LU	810	825	And as I was reading on the website of UCLA when it was discovered, the history of the University of California Los Angeles starts in 1919 when it's the southern branch of the University of California, which was created by the state legislature.
7655	Patterson	Jim	119	nZglKWPAZEc	288	310	is there additional information about the energy use, has that energy use significantly moderated as a result of those policies. And whether or not we actually are having some kind of a economic analysis of energy use, job creation, those kinds of things.
7656	Leyva	Connie	62	7E5hMfSVPig	816	838	That said, I want to ask about the peace officers that are employed by DTSC, and I have some information that in 2005, the department Investigators asked prosecutors to bring charges against polluters involved in 45 investigations.
7657	Gatto	Mike	46	oWaFMHsMqpI	33	44	Now if you kill someone with a gun or a knife in California, there's roughly a 65% chance that you'll be brought to justice. If you kill someone with a vehicle in California there's just a 20% chance that you'll be brought to justice.
7658	Gomez	Jimmy	80	QXW5aikdMmE	37	52	AB 1445, Brown, increase contract value limit for use of streamline contacting process Holding Committee. AB 1461, provides automatic voter registration upon submission of driver's license application with opt out provisions do pass. B roll call.
7659	Hernandez	Ed	103	7ULUe19PTjQ	2003	2016	Thank you. The Chair is recommending an aye vote. We have item number four, SB 149 Stone Investigative drugs, biological products. That is going to be do pass to B & P committee. Call the members please.
7660	Mitchell	Holly	64	NOpjVjVZw80	28	63	Hopefully everybody has a copy, all 56 pages of it. Let's go ahead with the first panel, Department of Managed Care. Have five areas we'll touch on. We'll start with the overview, move into the Federal Mental Health Parity rules, enrollment in individual market, large group claims data exposure, and delta plan's medical loss ratio.
7661	Fuller	Jean	49	bkbYI6-vC30	1532	1567	And now we're at a state where we still haven't been able to adequately control for the problem nor are we aware of what  the potential over-arching financial impact will be and how we will deal with that, and that's just that's important information for me to be sure that we are able to contain this in a cost-effective way.
7662	Monning	Bill	25	34DjaBqbEpQ	1828	1847	Well, appreciate the framing and the prioritization and we just incur not to denigrate your efforts to try to find partners. If these assets are sitting there collecting dust and we're paying rent, I don't know maybe someone would be interested on Craigslist.
7663	Mitchell	Holly	64	34DjaBqbEpQ	1817	1828	But, then it must have been 11 or so because we heard this every year in sub one that they began to kind of scale down. So we had them and not used them, and we've only had them for a relatively short period of time.
7664	Hancock	Loni	98	zieucXg-cLU	29	47	One of my big takeaways from today is the business about in the end it's all about relationships and somebody being a friend as opposed to whatever. And so I sort of wanted to go back to something that Ken Berrick said.
7665	Chau	Ed	116	2Dc5I9_7zFA	828	854	I think when it comes to affordable housing the state of California, we are at a crisis state. And I think the overall goal is for us to build more affordable housing. Now the issue is how do we find that balance between providing sufficient parking or creating some kind of a spillover versus unused parking spaces, and we have taken that approach and essentially used the existing numbers and lowered those numbers and then meeting the opposition half way.
7666	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	n81cNAsH1gw	1005	1021	Recent expansions in insurance coverage under the affordable care act and expanded Medical have improved healthcare coverage for this population yet, even with the expansion, children from low income households face significant barriers to access care and services.
7667	Atkins	Toni	110	CY8dWb1-gXw	2052	2079	We don't want the small people from Allergan, and Qualcomm, and all of those who are coming up with their own ideas, not to be able to do that here. We want to compete for those businesses to be in our regions, connected to our higher education institutions, to actually help California become, again the seventh and sixth largest economies in the world, and to support small jobs.

7670	Maienschein	Brian	84	X4Bkp9BrIdE	1359	1381	These risks already exist. They're already there. No one's talking about providing personal social security numbers of city employees. That's not what this does. That's there. That is and obviously the city of San Diego has 12,000 employees. That information is sitting in computer files somewhere. That's at risk of a cyber security attack, period.
7671	De Leon	Kevin	102	rEreViIPqP0	661	677	Madame President as well as colleagues, this morning I'm very pleased. I'm very pleased to have the opportunity to introduce a delegation of six Chilean grid officials. They are visiting California to obtain strategies to help Chile move from a 1% renewable energy portfolio to meeting its goal of using renewable sources for 20% of its energy consumption by 2025.

7673	Gatto	Mike	46	uUsytMtXn1I	1376	1395	Well, you can't opt out of the screening. But there's three stages. There's screening, there's storage and then there's experimentation. My bill has to do with stage two and stage three, the storage and the experimentation. It has nothing to do with the screening.

7677	Pan	Richard	96	1ThUxLCsowo	42	73	In 2003, the UC lost a court ruling. The Superior Court ruled that UC must be disclose the performance of venture capital funds in which it invests. That ruling followed two similar rulings, which required CalPERS to disclose the performance of venture capital funds in which it invests, and the management fees it pays venture capital funds. In 2005, the legislature responded with SB 439 by Senator Simitian that required the UC and other public pension funds to disclose, fund-by-fund, performance data for its venture capital investments.
7678	Wagner	Donald	88	4tou47dRNaA	501	514	that can't get the big relief, because we're going to pass it that we ought to do, at least get a little bit of the small relief. So for that reason I'm going to be in support of this bill despite the recognition that it's not perfect, and not a total solution to the problem.
7679	Mitchell	Holly	64	IO307YMxf6Q	1217	1237	So my point is, if employers continue to have that information, what prohibits them from having these policies, like the Legislature, where you can't earn more than 10%? See what I'm saying? Because that has nothing to do with the value of the job. You just can't make more than 10% from your previous employer.
7680	Allen	Benjamin	70	QF0xTMWqn0g	1284	1319	At the end of the day, you know, I guess in these kinds of circumstances you'd want to have more public process and you want to have more engagement given the ambiguity associated with the impact on the aquifers and also the impact on the aquifers I suppose. I hope you share that view.
7681	Beall	Jim	92	84LBK3fic7E	461	488	Just a couple of responses regarding gaming, the greenhouse gas emission situation, the Air Quality Board has set up a research group or a group of study to set up some consistent standards regarding air quality and how they calculate those air quality issues.

So the statement that it would not have particular harm, I think is factually incorrect. And I just want us to identify and focus on this particular issue which is at hand, this language here.

7685	Leno	Mark	60	QoWDHxezaEY	312	333	Alright. I would agree with the chair that you're completely on the right track. This is a problem that impacts my district as well as yours and probably all of ours. But the assessments really do add up, and then I understand that these fines can be accrued daily.
7686	Hertzberg	Robert	99	xvcU4IJP8VQ	543	554	That's what we're trying to do, and to take a more holistic view and begin to elevate that discussion a little bit and engage. I think it's exactly right. We gotta answer those questions. Any other opposition? Anything further from the members?

In the early 1950s, it was unheard of for a woman to serve as a lawyer in a District Attorney's office, but Mr. Sorenson saw her potential and helped launch her career. Mr. Sorenson also hired and trained both of his successors, Jim Fox and Steve Wagstaffe,
7689	Mullin	Kevin	31	xdTTK0YoutY	1824	1843	Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I rise today to honor one of San Mateo County's most dedicated public servants, retired District Attorney Keith Sorenson, who passed away on March 20, 2015 at the age of 93. Mr. Sorenson left a legacy and standard of excellence
7690	Garcia	Cristina	112	4sq_B6zlasQ	1741	1758	AB 302 would specify that schools that one or more lactating students shall provide these students with access to a private secure room to deal with any needs associated with breastfeeding or expressing milk. This bill leaves flexibility for the schools to find the solution that best meets the mothers and schools needs, and allows schools to use existing facilities. This bill also helps

7693	Gomez	Jimmy	80	omT12LxK-8I	851	873	And it's something that we can address in an amendment when it goes to appropriation, as long as their concerns do not morph over time, I'm okay with that. Anything that moves goalpost on an amendment, then I'm going to have some disagreements.
7694	Cooper	Jim	21	gKbbsG2YN94	1502	1525	AB 732 would create a brand inspection exemption for cattle being sold on the account of not being moved out-of-state and when the controlling interest of the farm remains the same. Under the current law when cattle are sold they must be inspected by the California Department of Food and Agriculture. Inspection includes a fee and is unnecessary cost to families that are just adding minority owners and the cattle are not moving out-of-state.
7695	Leno	Mark	60	aItBzVMycEU	740	771	Well, within a few years we saw that we not only could reach the 20%, but we could do it sooner than we thought we could and our former colleague Joseph Median picked up the banner and led the charge to raise that 20% to 33%. Same arguments were made against it and guess what, few years down the road we realize we're going to get to that 33% faster than we thought we could and what happened in the meantime?
7696	Dababneh	Matthew	50	w8nI6ofQavM	585	600	Nowhere in the bill does it say this. It is a little alarming that these institutions that are publicly funded or take publicly funded money are so upset and objecting to the ability for taxpayers to have an ability to have oversight in any shape.

7700	Irwin	Jacqui	16	IBKt_ere1yc	609	631	Given the size of California government, a breach can be similarly costly and this bill represents an investment in security that is well worth the cost. For example, of the assessments performed in the past two years, an average of 13 vulnerabilities were identified on each state system that was assessed and through the process there was a collective tenfold reduction in risk.

That's something that I've been interested in from the ground-up, having helped begin a biotech academy in our local public high school and local government and continuing on our work in the Education Committee.
7703	Nielsen	Jim	68	J-efxTqVOiQ	339	350	I believe that we can find that common ground and maybe this year it'll be a little bit easier. It is a pleasure to serve with you. Look forward to our deliberations.
7704	Wagner	Donald	88	r0_c68VZXFY	930	949	Thank you. If the resolution went in, and I mean I know it mentions the Martin Luther King Hospital and whatnot, but I'd be much more comfortable with it as my colleague Mr. Gallagher said, if we were talking about the great things going on in the community now.
7705	McGuire	Mike	93	MpQ4SGzO7GE	1190	1213	You're, you're absolutely correct, but I'll tell you this though, it costs County Sonoma $100,000 a year to try to figure out who is on vacation rental websites and who's not because right now it's a in-opting. You pay if you choose to be a good citizen it's so that's the challenge.
7706	Alejo	Luis	9	99NWh04_JOI	77	91	For these reasons, I've authored AB 595, a bill that would have updated that code, but I believe that our vision laws need to be updated in a way that reflects the modern realities and protects optometrists clinical judgement which was the goal of that bill.

7708	Stone	Jeff	26	Tb_ZR86SMpk	996	1014	I must note that the talks about fogging. Well, landlords don't have a legal right to go into an apartment or go into a home that releasing and set off a fog bomb in there because you may have some type of infestation whether in these units.
7709	Pavley	Fran	104	9ZvAfunEMro	887	914	Probably not a good idea to bring up Senator Allen's district in the middle of this discussion, but anyway, thank you very much for all three of your testimony. Any other people wishing to add on their name in support of the measure? There's a few coming up I think, yes. Just name and affiliation and position of support.
7710	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	u_HcGIAoQdY	840	854	You don't drive down the 710 and see a 10, 11 year old truck anymore. And where they just don't exist in then Southern California region by and large. And that's because of the efforts we've made down there coming from Long Beach. Okay, representing the two ports in the state Assembly.
7711	Mitchell	Holly	64	Ynfh3sF9xbU	348	369	I don't know if it's the case-- if I may Mr. Chair.I've seen a variety of actual forms, various hospitals, you know, have an actual booklet that you can go through that provides questions that are very helpful I think to initiate, as someone mentioned the importance of collectively having these kinds of conversations with family and loved ones.
7712	Hueso	Ben	48	dmdc2oNqHGQ	244	260	With over 10 million immigrants, the largest population of immigrants available for administrative relief and naturalization in the nation, California has a unique opportunity to lift families out of poverty and increase their financial security.
7713	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	I1DeZTgw_DI	1544	1560	And quite frankly, I think it's fair and just to establish, just like we have minimum wage and overtime protections, that when large, rich corporations are choosing to operate on Thanksgiving and Christmas, that they should compensate their workers, yes.
7714	Achadjian	K.H. "Katcho"	5	UonYQneKEjk	1662	1681	Thank you Mr Speaker. I rise to present AB 1178 which will strengthen the California's current laws by limiting manufacturers from taking negative actions against a dealer when a vehicle is exported or resold after the dealer has collected sales tax and registered the vehicle in California.  This bill has received unanimous support. I respectfully ask for your Aye vote.
7715	Liu	Carol	63	43wK_WUALhw	183	201	I just, I don't quite understand. I mean we've been, and I've been sitting here for a long time. And it's very, if we just talk about money, it's really hard. But if we try to change the conversation about how we address the problem, maybe we can look at it another way.
7716	Waldron	Marie	29	y3urT0JPp1g	428	440	Regarding people who are using those little Wi-Fi devices but they're close to the border, say, of the state, I could see maybe they're picking up a signal from across or vice versa.
7717	Lara	Ricardo	107	kyRwF6Xn7UY	341	357	Moving on to AB 1366, Dream Resource Liaisons, do pass as amended to authorize high schools to have a liaison and to remove the mandate. Substitute the roll from AB 2. The bill is approved on a 5 to 2 vote with Republicans voting no.
7718	Lara	Ricardo	107	kyRwF6Xn7UY	357	369	Next item is Assembly Member Low, AB 8578, occupational safety and health, do pass to the Senate Floor. Substitute the roll from AB 2, this bill is approved on a five to two vote, with Republicans voting no.
7719	Mullin	Kevin	31	tI-QOGtgDxM	602	650	Thank you Mr. Bonta. Seeing no discussion or debate on the item, clerk will open the roll. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote.
7720	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	2W00giXvusA	628	646	And the analysis speaks to also reimbursable cost to the Department of Toxic Substance Control and the like. So it's new encumbered responsibilities that exacerbate the funds in addition to the labeling requirements. And as you see in the analysis as well, the industry trade associations are supportive.
7721	Gomez	Jimmy	80	rzSOQHmJW3U	1579	1618	before being subject to penalties. Six, clarify that individual liability does not impact current litigation on the definition of employer. Seven, add a co author. B roll call. SB 599 Mendoza, employment public transit service contracts, do pass. Thanks. B roll call. Okay.
7722	Lara	Ricardo	107	aItBzVMycEU	1044	1083	So I do understand the importance of being at the vanguard of these technologies and promoting these important policies, but as we move forward, I asked that we seek that balance and I think this bill seeks to do that and I think if we look at the fact that we need to prioritize, if we're going to continue to need oil, that is prioritized for California oil extraction.
7723	De Leon	Kevin	102	-v1uD0LX8sQ	1335	1353	But, in this legislation and 350. We have the ability to democratize a process where we'll have electrical charging stations throughout the State of California irrespective of your zip code, irrespective of the color of your skin or your social economic strata
7724	Pavley	Fran	104	4MjmF7EnXtg	1490	1504	And so that??s something you can address, I guess it relates to level of due process. It??s in your jurisdiction, not subject for today's discussion. So, questions of members?
7725	Weber	Shirley	44	iylj0sWv7JI	1134	1164	Yes, I really appreciate and thank the fact that the CSU, we held off really putting forth the recommendation for this particular policy until the CSU had an opportunity to weigh in on it. This coming year we had a bill, last year we held up waiting for them to, obviously, to give us some guidance and input on the policy, which we've taken. They still have authority to accept or reject the fee in terms of the students; the recommendation goes basically to the Chancellor's office to decide if the fees will be there or not.
7726	Leno	Mark	60	EvXJx3b_7-s	927	945	But I think if we go back about thirty-five years, LAO will correct me if I'm too far off, but about thirty-five years ago, we spent 7% of our general fund on the UC system alone. We're now at about 2%.
7727	McGuire	Mike	93	GHyOxyKfubI	1648	1661	We agree with the chairwoman and the committee that we should adjust the language to require the board of equalization to establish clear policies for the state taxation of licenses. Our bill does differ from others that you may have seen in several ways.
7728	Burke	Autumn	6	R5jZe-4pYBI	1985	2007	And also, 90% of hospitals are nonprofit hospitals, right, so they work under that auspices, 90% of hospitals. So when we talk about the concerns about for-profit and nonprofit hospitals, obviously, that exists in both spaces.
7729	Bloom	Richard	2	9fvwP7KwrvY	243	276	Let me see if I can ask a couple of questions that are specific to the exemptions, excuse me, specific to the amendments. With respect to the medical board oversight issue, I'm wondering if both sides can address why the oversight that is proposed in the bill is superior, the same, or inferior.
7730	Leyva	Connie	62	_yhFBNo6QkM	1685	1695	We all use the roads, so it's going to be up to us to fund that to make sure that we can still use those roads and that they're safe. So those are just a couple observations.
7731	Hertzberg	Robert	99	7wM-SWUAGJQ	1190	1203	We have a case where someone got a $25 ticket for failing to make a change of address and because of all the penalty assessments, lost their driver's license, and the bill amounted to $2900 bucks.
7732	Beall	Jim	92	2Dc5I9_7zFA	1766	1796	Okay, so possibly that affordability component will continue, and the parking ratio allowed will continue as long as the affordability is in effect. You do something like that. That's another way of locking it in a little bit more in terms of. So, this goes to Government Finance so, after this committee. So, we can, if you want us to start-
7733	Brown	Cheryl	13	k8jlrtfy69g	0	20	Thank you. Now we have public testimony. We're getting late in our day, I really would love to have the first panel come back. But right now, I think it's only fair that we have the public testimony.
7734	Leyva	Connie	62	m65WWf8IMs4	464	476	I was working, my husband was working, and I don't even know that I would have been the best person to home-school my children. They would probably agree with that. They are college graduates, and that's because they had a great education.
7735	Frazier	Jim	114	3Luw7tOrBzg	470	483	And I just have on more question. Both the US Department of Education and the Department of Veteran's Affairs have real customer measures, but they ignore each other, making them basically ineffective.
7736	Dababneh	Matthew	50	0BI7ZwRm0UU	1533	1548	But for higher incidents that obviously have greater consequence could an officer in your department, or another department from out of state, before they do their report, could they ask to see ATM footage?
7737	Allen	Benjamin	70	sVrNV-ZoGOI	254	265	I'll now turn the microphone over to my dear colleague and friend from the valley Bob Hertzberg, he'll make some opening remarks and then we'll turn to our Secretary of State, Alex Padilla.
7738	Beall	Jim	92	CY8dWb1-gXw	1270	1302	The tendency is for small business to get an R&D tax credit where they haven't had a significant portion of the existing R&D tax credit is a logical one. We should maybe look at the disbursement between the types of businesses we have in California and the types of businesses that create jobs, and then look at where the R&D tax credits are going in terms of the creation of those jobs.
7739	Liu	Carol	63	ZozhIodyLFc	174	193	The bill is part of a package of legislation recommended by the Senate Select Committee on Aging and Long-term Care, which I chair. Consumers may be eligible for contingent benefits if their long-term care insurance premiums rate dramatically increases, and they don't have a nonforfeiture option.
7740	Beall	Jim	92	pJxZbc1RoIw	964	977	But you see what I'm saying? Because the mistake was made when we sold those bonds in the first place without backing them with some kind of revenue base to pay for the bond debt service. We didn't do that. So we don't wanna make the same mistake again.
7741	Mullin	Kevin	31	D1U0Ojzunqk	739	759	Those kinds of things. Is this the kind of regulatory framework, if we put in place that can be scaled up if that were an eventuality? Or are those really two, is that a twin-track conversation, or can this be built out to address the larger legalization issues? Could you address that?
7742	Chiu	David	7	ASNmI2rHU9I	1363	1376	I very much appreciate that, and, and I, in my last conversation with pharm I had requested to see if there was, if there was a way to, to gather all the information that's out there because frankly, if any of you have tried to take a look at it, it's very hard to, to discern.
7743	Chiu	David	7	1ULf869aoVg	1407	1421	At this time Mr. Dodd has asked for an aye vote. The clerk will open the roll. All those vote who desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote. All those vote who desire to vote.
7744	Chu	Kansen	32	JqxWtsdpeUk	122	159	Great, thank you very much. That leave seven more items on today's calendar and I'd like to limit the testimony to three witnesses on each side and three minutes for each of the witnesses. and any public that would like to add please line up to my left, your right, and the microphone and state your name and the affiliation. So we will begin with AB 743. Ms. Eggman.
7745	McGuire	Mike	93	HU5u3bnal2k	1035	1053	Thank you so much Mr. President. I want to first thank the author for all of the hard work and obviously as Chairwoman as well as the Education Committee. I know that there is an additional bill that's going to be coming from the assembly and this bill is a continued work-in-progress and would hope that there's going to
7746	Santiago	Miguel	17	eYTxGLtgMco	675	689	Yeah. No. Thank you, Mister Chair and, thank you for the authors for been this, this robust conversation. And I think this is a tough issue cuz when I first looked at it I, you know, I, I, tended to want to a, agree with, with the intent and I still do.
7747	Wieckowski	Bob	55	nGcU-tnoqVY	1251	1270	And then come February, they're washing their windows, and they got cited by the franchisor of some horrible non-compliance. How would this legislation protect those folks? They have sixty days to correct it, I guess stop questioning them?
7748	De Leon	Kevin	102	5cbDr55Nnpw	1824	1844	And to increase the pressure on your friends. So, we can actually get this to happen and come to fruition. Symbolic resolutions are very important because they unify us together and send a very clear message, But we're also very close to getting something that historically is very important for all individuals
7749	Bonilla	Susan	3	Dis8InqVM6k	688	706	That we're not adequately communicating that the scope of the crisis that we're in and what the outcomes will be if we don't achieve restoration and then a long range plan. Do you have any suggestions? What are you thinking? And how can we as legislators help communicate beyond a sense of urgency? I think a sense of urgency we passed a few years ago.
7750	McGuire	Mike	93	IKy1yzt0SRs	1363	1377	Again, and Mr. Beall and I have talked about this related to transportation. Keep your in issue of a surplus. Because of voter mandate, the vast majority of dollars are going to public education. Number one, backfilling recession era cuts and bringing this up, hopefully, to the middle of the pack down from 50 in the nation when it comes to approved people spending.
7751	McGuire	Mike	93	IKy1yzt0SRs	1343	1361	Mr. Hernandez has brought forward practical bill, that will tackle some of the toughest subjects of this special session, and I do appreciate that. I do appreciate also, Ms. Kent from the Administration, engaging on this important issue. A few items. Would like to talk about budget; would like to talk about tobacco, as well as disability services.
7752	Bonilla	Susan	3	Dis8InqVM6k	646	688	And I guess, I'm just wondering if you have any suggestions in terms of how we can frame this in a way to make sure that we have all the tools we need to actually address this because I just continue and I've met with many advocates and there's a real sense of frustration that we're not getting the message out.
7753	Pan	Richard	96	FVQ4YG_BqFE	100	118	Some pedal-powered operators have gone out of business already due to over-regulation by cities that never encountered these types of vehicles. So SB 530 would provide regulatory clarity uniformity, as well as minimum safety standards that lend themselves to successful operation and for these innovative small businesses to grow in California.
7754	Bigelow	Frank	91	taVqkacMZr4	1195	1206	I'm sorry, but with, with all due respect, I'll, I'll recognize the author's request and I'll start with his two witnesses, reminding you that each you each have just a couple of minutes for testimony.
7755	Hill	Jerry	66	1KGu-z0GNGc	173	192	While at least seven other states have passed laws governing the use of license plate readers, current California law has not kept up with the rapid adoption of the technology. Current law addresses license plate reader use by the CHP and transportation agencies, but it ignores local law enforcement and private uses.
7756	Stone	Jeff	26	LrUb6Z3dcdU	507	525	How can we give a secure feeling to those that have traumatic brain injury that want to get back into the workforce, want to be independent once again without the fear that they're going to have to go through mazes of federal and state bureaucracies to get back on assistance if they need to.
7757	Gomez	Jimmy	80	oC8-KbPE6Yo	1120	1132	Questions or comments from the committee members? Seeing none, well, thank you for bringing this bill forward. 150,000, it just hit the mark of the suspense threshold, so there we go.
7758	Bates	Pat	58	-kB_gg_15b8	131	141	I just want to express my appreciation as certainly from the 36 Senate district where we do have an issue regarding an emergency room that's going, let's say, it's under a change.
7759	Hill	Jerry	66	LVzFkfmZq9U	153	169	SB 34 updates California law to do just this. First, the bill requires a public agency considering to use the use of license plate readers to provide an opportunity for public comment at a regularly-scheduled public meeting of its governing body.
7760	Mendoza	Tony	52	RChcWpGW4gA	950	965	Just to note here that the Committee analysis notes that the cost to the Department of Social Services with licensing these child care facilities, are expected to be minor and absorbable. And we have some witnesses here in support.
7761	Irwin	Jacqui	16	SfuHS4UPco0	1190	1206	So I just had a couple of questions. The first is, I think everybody really mentioned funding for services. But you tell us. What are possibilities of, where will that funding possibly come from?
7762	Hancock	Loni	98	RplCDWdFT8I	263	270	So, the bill is very simple, very straightforward, and clarifies an important but complicated area of the law. There are no other questions or comments? Please read the roll. Oh, would you like to close?
7763	Mathis	Devon	75	24W2oeMkjbI	1722	1734	Just, I, I wanna let you guys know I'm definitely willing to work with the committee on any concerns moving this forward. And I just wanna make sure that we continue to take care of our veterans.
7764	Moorlach	John	4657	m8iyuGdEmL0	1532	1556	But you're working on a project and I applaud you on that cuz we need to figure out, how does everything fit in the whole because this bill is pro-business, I'm there. This bill is fixing ADA concerns, I'm there. But I just don't, see how it all fits with this tax component which is the third leg of the stool, how it all fits into the whole.
7765	Weber	Shirley	44	Vh_5v2RZyR4	482	504	So since they want the bridge and they need the bridge, and they need the ability to create transportation across the bridge with this new rail system that they're hoping to put in place that they're still working on. That that would be a condition. That we would do the 15 million to help with the renovation of the bridge for the transportation purposes.
7766	Hancock	Loni	98	670ewxdSqNM	764	784	Thank you, Senator Liu. Senator Block and I both deal with budget subcommittees, and this is where it would be very helpful. If there are times when the law, there's a decision not to implement something that was in a budget or a piece of legislation.
7767	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	lkVCXXoPpBw	310	320	These Californians also include school children who, according to the California Department of Public Health, face increased rates of asthma due to chemicals from cleaning products in the air.
7768	Monning	Bill	25	YaTK7ym74zw	586	597	SB 253 seeks to address this issue. I respectfully ask for an aye vote when suspense is considered. Thank you Mr. Chair, members. We have a couple of witnesses in support. Thank you.
7769	Hancock	Loni	98	rW1B4Jx9iIw	1871	1894	I think there's a great deal of interest on the part of the committees in seeing if there are places that are doing very, very well. Places that are outliers, again, and where there's more use of force, perhaps more deadly use of force, how can those places be helped. You know, data is useful.
7770	Hancock	Loni	98	YzFtbDOOfn0	2	17	Thank you. I'm going to ask if you guys could stay here while we hear from PPIC because the two studies, or the work that's going on I think is very complementary. I'd like to welcome Ryan, and I take it it's Garay?
7771	Monning	Bill	25	YaTK7ym74zw	540	575	The data is very troubling, members. Nearly one in four foster youths receive powerful psychotropic drugs. Of all the children taking psychotropic medications in California, of all children, 52% who are given antipsychotics are given antipsychotics which have risk factors that can lead to lifelong disabilities such as tremors, obesity and diabetes. 48% of foster youth are given antidepressants that have an FDA black box label warning for use by children.
7772	McCarty	Kevin	22	ZcJSZ4qEe4Y	1224	1238	One of the issues that we, that, that, that came up are facilities especially school districts that want to provide more early education that some of the districts that don't have or that don't have declining enrollment are facing the, facing the facilities crunch.
7773	Monning	Bill	25	nhiEIYehp1Y	1146	1170	Thank you Madam Chair. I just want to thank the author for bringing this forward and those here in support. And I think it's important to underscore the importance of this curriculum for all students. It's critically important to students who come from our diverse ethnic communities, but also for those from those historically dominant communities in California.
7774	Chiu	David	7	IhpbvS6HoRM	513	537	At this time the clerk will open the roll on the consent calendar. All those who vote who desire to vote. All those who vote who desire to vote. This is on the consent calendar. All those who vote who desire to vote. All those who vote who desire to vote.
7775	Cooper	Jim	21	EgZgFkyj3MQ	1880	1916	Kyle was known for his bright spirit and energy and was a dependable, resourceful, enthusiastic, and dedicated to the state's legislature. He was a native of Sacramento and is survived by his parents, siblings, grandmother and numerous other family members and friends. He will be missed.
7776	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	-OpN4Uo7BxE	1260	1277	It will require the Secretary of State to provide notice to the citizens stating that they will be registered to vote unless they decline to be registered within 21 days. It will require the Secretary of State to provide the records to the county elections official of the county in which the person may be registered to vote if eligible to vote.
7777	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	z7GYIGDOm-s	452	475	to the fact that that trainer doesn't know what he's doing. Or if you had that connection in mind, you probably wouldn't hire him in the first place. So I think there has been just sort of culturally, this lack of appreciation for the fact that a lot of injuries probably are associated with people who don't know what they're doing participating in,
7778	Anderson	Joel	57	MVCeSI-m6QA	1435	1453	I too rise in support in support. Title nine has been absolutely important. But let's not forget every proud father who's telling all his buddies "look at my child, she plays college ball." or in my case "I'm very proud of my daughter who played college puck".
7779	Hancock	Loni	98	g_HgBg8yC5k	72	84	They are forced to rely on public benefits and public services, even though many of them want more than anything else to be part of the community and go to work.
7780	Olsen	Kristin	15	d_EaaILk1VE	61	80	Thank you Madame Chair and Members.  ACA 1 will increase transparency and will let us alter by requiring all bills to be in print and available online for at least 72 hours before final passage by the Assembly or Senate. It does provide exceptions for states of emergency declared by the Governor.
7781	Leno	Mark	60	YrZrpwtmLSQ	489	507	These and other many challenges of homelessness can cause a youth not to finish high school and in fact 75% of homeless youth do not finish high school and do not get their high school diploma; 75%.
7782	Leno	Mark	60	Uqg2olh0M7g	597	614	Thank you. So first of all, let me reassure everyone and anyone. And I want to thank our visiting student who is so articulate. Congratulations on all your success and I know your future is going to be very bright. I also want to assure you this bill will not close the doors of Apex.
7783	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	keBQI17Ppm8	1280	1295	Thank you. Any persons in opposition to this bill? Come forward. Seeing no opposition. Members of the committee? Any of the members of the committee wish to comment? Seeing no members that wish to comment. Mr. Holden -- oh Mr. Chavez, wave, come on man.
7784	Hill	Jerry	66	XrOqCob7jCo	609	629	Lastly, this bill will make technical and clarifying changes on other licensees overseen by the bureau, including updating the site and fine structures for many license categories the bureau is tasked with overseeing. There were also policy issues raised in the analysis that we will be working on and looking to resolve, so thank you for that. Respectfully ask for an aye vote, members.
7785	Lara	Ricardo	107	-Ah0Dbgfor4	1287	1307	To SB 224, elderly parole program, do pass as amended to raise program eligibility to 60 years of age or older, or at least 25 years of years served. We will substitute the roll from SB 454. That bill is approved on a five to two vote with Republicans voting no.
7786	Jones	Brian	42	7dMs8PMx4Kc	1035	1048	I want to, as we're wrapping up, kind of go back to some things that were said earlier. Mister Dodd, Mister Wood, myself, Mister Hill mentioned our constituents being the licensees.
7787	Stone	Jeff	26	YSUIHVlik4w	250	267	So this is a good opportunity to Legislature to start a more robust conversation about how we can close on these gaps. And as we head into the need for telemedicine and other areas that will be relying on large transfers of data across networks that get to be developed,
7788	Beall	Jim	92	84LBK3fic7E	1965	1980	Okay? And then people say well we shouldn't have the general fund pay for the transportation thing. So we want the truck wave case to come back and put back into the transportation fund, which my bill does.
7789	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	OVIQdDmHNzI	1940	1966	I think we've addressed many of the concerns, I am very prepared to continue working to make it a better bill. I would like to say that with dispersants, since the beginning of OSPR they've never used them. And so I think it's fairly well accepted that this, although at one point may have been a knee jerk reaction to use them, we've acknowledged they are not a best approach to this.
7790	Gomez	Jimmy	80	NEf6zh-NPIY	995	1011	Today, I have Jenya Cassidy director of the California Work and Family Coalition, Kim Turner attorney with the Legal Aid Society Employment Law, and David Chase of the Small Business Majority.
7791	Stone	Jeff	26	tCaUe0Vt8NQ	893	919	And, I'm, I, I'm concerned about that. It's 63%, and the national average is 83%. Are we failing in a way in which we're sending to children to, to bed hungry, or seniors to bed hungry? How are we reaching out to these people that are not following up with these resources that are available to them I'm just puzzled, in seeing this for the first time.
7792	Patterson	Jim	119	nZglKWPAZEc	417	438	I appreciate the fact that we're the eighth largest economy in the planet. When I was Mayor of Fresno in the 1990s, early 2000s, we were the sixth largest economy on the planet. I would submit that we have some catching up to do, and I think we need to improve the business climate along with the approaches that we're taking to make California much more business friendly place.
7793	Mitchell	Holly	64	oFD3dFY_sMo	1399	1417	But we aren't doing what we could do as a state. Hence, the introduction of this bill to try to provide a few additional albeit meager resources to help families slip deeper into poverty. CalWORKS is not lifting people out of poverty. We're providing the basic, core safety net as a transition to them.
7794	Wood	Jim	72	N6EhWxD1_nY	853	865	At some point I fear we're going to annoy consumers with this kind of, every product having these long things like this with very small font that are difficult to read.
7795	Weber	Shirley	44	NTCK9Uu4-ME	993	1006	But also to ensure that there's no gap in services as we wait to try to implement the new concept. That there would be a gap in terms of people not receiving services. So as a result of that, we are still working on, I'm working with the finance, with all the agencies.
7796	Garcia	Eduardo	38	1fxZCVj9XoA	454	472	It is a metal theft task force bill that would create a task force under the Department of Justice in order to enforce the escalating problems that we see not only in California, but particularly in the 56th District has relates to metal theft.
7797	Gordon	Richard	117	9MQl_MfHN90	713	739	In 2014, there were nearly 64 million vehicles in the United States subject to recall. That amounts to about 1 of every 4 cars on the road today. While that number is shocking, early indications are that the number of recalls in 2015 may be even greater. Unfortunately, in many instances, getting the recall service completed is not as simple as calling a franchise dealer and making an appointment.
7798	Block	Marty	59	J0kwSkFFMEE	1616	1646	I mean, to give them funds and say the locals are in control when there are state imposed tests that don't include CTE, we have may have local board members would love to fund CTE at a higher-rate but they know that they are held accountable how they do in math and science and English and they're not really held accountable to how they do in CTE on the tests, on the tests that the parents look at, on the tests that people moving into the area look at.
7799	Hall	Isadore	1	J8Jo0_kPCZ0	1744	1770	But I wanna open it up for the audience. If there's anyone from the audience who would like to submit their comment or remarks. All right, seeing none. Again, I wanna also thank our staffs from both the Assembly GO and the Senate GO for their participation in helping to pull this hearing together.
7800	Hueso	Ben	48	woVTT_HPcvA	68	88	This is a very descriptive chart, and this is a daunting chart, I think, for our elderly population, to try to navigate through to obtain services, and I'm very saddened for them, having to put them through this system, this extensively over-bureaucratic system.
7801	Bonilla	Susan	3	goLRzsDXvfE	723	740	This bill simply says that this is the requirement that should be put upon the school districts themselves that applies to our school districts, our county offices of education, and our charter schools to say that you need to actually provide and pay for these induction programs.
7802	Beall	Jim	92	AitqXvQevXM	64	83	The law placed a flat $4 additional penalty on vehicle code violations. The penalty was collected and used to fund MediCal services specifically for air-ambulance services, and drawing down federal matching funds.
7803	De Leon	Kevin	102	45V7xUBPIec	63	78	And in fact, for that matter, I have no idea if the public had any confidence in the PUC to begin with since day one. But things ebb and flow all the time, but why don't you give us your observations as to why you're leaning towards these structural changes.
7804	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	i194v81Ek5E	792	805	But that is very targeted feature and quite frankly the cost of diapers is so exorbitant that, the need for, relieving some of those costs extend beyond those moms who are in Cal Works and really is a middle class issue.
7805	McGuire	Mike	93	qbDN-8u61LI	1303	1313	But, I just think it's an important distinction to be able to point out 266 had law enforcement support because they merged the bills prior to going to the Assembly floor.
7806	Hernandez	Ed	103	7vLzhqaEeV8	492	508	Thank you. Then the other set of questions to Mr. Lewis from UNITE HERE Local 12. Just some clarification on your breakdown. You had said 20% of your overall trend is for your drug pricing. Is that the correct number that you gave me?
7807	Weber	Shirley	44	7bdBeI04iMY	168	186	into a better position of being able to collect data in terms of what is really happening in California. Right now most of us look at the information and it's anecdotal information in terms of what is happening so therefore we're limited in terms of the kind of information we have regarding the incidents occurring in California
7808	Dababneh	Matthew	50	TSE2ocY_LpM	84	95	women in our state working on these projects in labor agreements. So it'll make sure they're making a fair wage to help build our schools and make sure they're at the topmost quality for safety and construction. Thank you so much.
7809	Weber	Shirley	44	7bdBeI04iMY	150	168	at the capital with the recognition even by law enforcement themselves of something called racial bias, that we all become victims of racial bias and hopefully we won't act on that and begin to engage in racial profiling. This bill that we present today as we look at the numerous issues that have happened throughout California gets us
7810	Liu	Carol	63	qCvvxF6FLEU	922	960	Thank you. My next bill is SB 527. Thank you. It's regarding the safe neighborhoods and school fund education grant program. The Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act was approved by voters as proposition 47 in November 2014. The act requires that 25 percent of the funds saved by the state under the initiative to be dispersed by the Department of Education to administer a grant program to improve outcomes for K-12 students by reducing truancy and supporting students who are at risk of dropping out of schools or who are victims of crime.
7811	Hernandez	Roger	37	I210RzVAPYs	593	610	Okay, our next presenter will be no other than our Senate Pro Tem, Senator De Leon. I understand that it's your preference to take up Senate Bill 548 first to accomodate-
7812	Hernandez	Ed	103	KTS25NPAjyE	187	366	Currently, that's five, we'll place those bills on call. Okay we're gonna move on to item number 7. AB 258 Levine, organ transplants, medical marijuana qualified patients. Good afternoon.
7813	Glazer	Steve	10481	sxH5Xtvq9A4	676	686	I think that, not just on this issue, but there are many others in state government where we might be served by giving something a good chance to see if it's there. Certainly be something that I'd be supportive of.
7814	McGuire	Mike	93	zieucXg-cLU	1038	1047	And always wanna say thank you to our sergeants, both Mr. Barrett and Ms. Bedford as well, for being here today. Thank you so much. And to our panelists.
7815	Liu	Carol	63	BQgV9eqQ2Tw	623	636	In addition to publicly noticing all meetings and allowing members of the public to attend these meetings free of charge, no more than two commissioners may meet to discuss items related to the commission outside of noticed meetings.
7816	Hall	Isadore	1	owIYV6IXgFg	70	90	SB 779 requires skilled nursing facilities to publicly post at all times the number of direct caregivers on duty and assure a minimum number of hours of care provided by certified nurses assistants by instituting specified staff-to-patient ratios.
7817	Leno	Mark	60	EkjCB3EukYI	154	182	and addictive nicotine is to begin to regulate the product as a tobacco product. And they are tobacco products, not just by definition of this bill, but by definition of federal law. And, proposed regulations that the food and drug administration have out right now and will be formalized later this calendar year. Centers for Disease Control along with our
7818	Wilk	Scott	19	iF8zLPAheNg	1599	1617	Thank you Mr. Speaker. I stand in support of AB 266. I want to thank all of the authors for all their hard work on this bill and I wanted to particularly salute my colleague from Palmdale who agreed to be a joint author, pun intended, on this bill which shows quite a
7819	Stone	Mark	20	4lx0MqjDD6Q	1388	1437	Thank you. Anyone else in support? Seeing none, is there any opposition? Seeing none, we'll bring it back to the committee. Senator, I think you have a very laudable goal. But as we've figured out, as we've worked through this. And I think the mayor of Fort Bragg would agree. It's a complex question, as we seek to untangle the history and the symbols that represent hatred in our community and symbols and individuals that persist in with that notion of racism and hatred. So I appreciate that you brought this forward. And the recommended motion is do pass as amended and this bill will then go to appropriations. Mr Gallagher?
7820	Williams	Das	12	-R4HGT4UbOs	149	189	Father, we live in a world of great confusion, despair, and problems. We need, therefore, the strength to recognize our weaknesses and the vision to identify what needs to be done. Give us, Lord, the wisdom to do what is right. The will and determination to stand for the truth, even though it would be at times unpopular.  But above all, Father, help us serve with dignity and honor the good people of this great state. Amen.
7821	Wood	Jim	72	2gM15KHmKpo	1138	1151	That's the kind of thing that we're seeing up there. Lots of tanks and things. Crudely constructed, streams diverted, pumped out, with little or no regard for anybody downstream.
7822	Block	Marty	59	iMCgrPZ8vzk	1470	1496	Thank you Senator. And while that's a very important question it's somewhat beyond the scope of the CFPB regulations. Thank you again for your testimony now it's my pleasure to invite up the Commissioner the California Department of Business Oversight Jan Owen, to talk about potential state regulatory impacts resulting from the proposal and Commissioner Owen will, again, have 10 minutes.
7823	Wieckowski	Bob	55	YaTK7ym74zw	1531	1551	The bill creates a mandatory meet and confer process that may be held in person or by telephone in which both parties provide specific legal authority to support their pleadings or demurrer in order that the plaintiffs may come to an agreement in ways that will avoid going into court for a hearing.
7824	De Leon	Kevin	102	_C-l6C8Fln0	767	812	Especially, you know, working together for immigrants, you know, it's been a pleasure. We had a wonderful dinner last night we hosted together. Democrats as Republicans alike that we hosted for all of our members. It's with great pleasure that I'd like to give the floor to Senator Bob Huff. Senator Bob Huff?
7825	Brown	Cheryl	13	SfuHS4UPco0	1111	1133	Yeah, I was gonna say, Inland Empire is kind of by itself. And whenever we add other areas in, it really dilutes, and we have probably more veterans in our area because of Norton Air Force Base and because of March Air Force Base because of the high desert Air Force bases.
7826	Wieckowski	Bob	55	ilwRLhZLtAc	1208	1219	One of the questions that the Committee asked on the training, I think I understand there's eight legal and moral classroom hours, and then there's a continuing education on the field on the discharge.
7827	Mitchell	Holly	64	Xps8YHyq2fA	289	305	Issue number three, the Early Start Program Restoration of Eligibility Criteria General Fund Back bill. The recommendation is to approve the May Revise. That's out with a three-O vote.
7828	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	aKK8kwy-F68	45	61	You decide how you want to use that twenty minutes and after the main support testimony has concluded, we're going to allow individuals to come up to the mic, state their name, affiliation, and their position in support.
7829	Leno	Mark	60	cKW0dtBGGXY	321	341	and the enforcement of it and they would have to do a lot of extra testing if those products that are made without aren't identified as such. So it would increase the cost of the bill and potentially be a poison pill because it could be held in appropriations.
7830	Moorlach	John	4657	1AD-QUnKZQc	709	726	So and there's reasons for that so we're saying if you put up a clothes lines it meets standards and so then all of a sudden you're saying community areas like I wouldn't be able to put it in a front yard, for instance, so everybody sees my clothesline.
7831	Leno	Mark	60	h8juzK-Kjc4	674	693	Tagging if two CPI. With millions of people out of poverty our goal again is to get our minimum wage at least to the federal poverty line. Which is about $24,300.
7832	Pan	Richard	96	5uh3qN9ccd0	175	184	For example, governments have used open data as a way to get feedback on private sector programs such as participatory budgeting efforts that better involve citizens in the process.
7833	Weber	Shirley	44	dic9GH4s49g	2006	2023	I appreciate you for bringing this comment forward. I think it's something that the Education Committee ought to be looking at carefully as we talk about how we're going to basically create a school district that's going to be responsive to the needs of our children and put us in a position where we can be proud of every school that we have in, in the state of California.
7834	Block	Marty	59	-TnUOxgh_ls	1765	1779	So, again, you have one minute each. Please state your name, the organization you represent, and we'll begin from left to right and fill in the empty seats as they empty. So, this goes to you.
7835	Holden	Chris	78	X5ZwfIJ2xIA	429	443	Mr. Speaker, I request unanimous consent to suspend Assembly rule 45.5. to allow Speaker Atkins, Assembly Members Alejo, Garcia, Gonzalez, Lopez, Jones-Sawyer, and Weber to speak on adjournment today.
7836	De Leon	Kevin	102	7E5hMfSVPig	1758	1776	The reason why I say this is that you need backup. You need support from the Secretary of CalEPA, Matthew Rodriguez. Obviously, the governor appointed you. But you need the governor's back up, and you need the horseshoe downstairs to back you up. You cannot do this alone.
7837	Hueso	Ben	48	G-cKeAHj51U	410	433	Just to respond to that, this bill wouldn't effect that. I'll explain why. If you are in an area or region where people are used to voting every November and it doesn't result in a decrease in voter participation off your elections, nobody can challenge those jurisdictions. If there's a general culture In that area of voting on off year elections, this, it doesn't kick in.
7838	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	iSM5Bpt31OQ	332	348	Alright, that bill has four to one, that bill is out. File item twenty, SB 589 by Senator Block. The motion is do pass to Senate appropriation. So, moved by Senator Leno. Please call the roll.
7839	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	csda2pMKJRU	411	428	As we've continued to take away the rights of workers in the workplace, productivity continues to go up. That, it, it, it doesn't matter, you have the ability, at any point, to reduce your work force for cause, if a worker is not doing their job.
7840	Monning	Bill	25	rrDz5IDQFPY	1562	1577	Thank you very much. I see no further public comment. We're going to move to our voting starting at the bottom of page 40. We have four items that we'll be voting on. I will be offering some revised language on item three when we get there.
7841	Block	Marty	59	BvEiMZK1K8A	885	913	Worldwide, this society is also the largest private supporter of research and has funded innovative research and advocated for government support of important scientific inquiry. The California chapters of the society have been working together to implement educational programs to raise awareness about the effects of MS and how those with MS can manage their lives with the disease. The resolution is sponsored by the National MS society and I respectfully ask your aye vote.
7842	De Leon	Kevin	102	IKESHE_NOXc	2324	2341	And when we have incredible African-American leadership, both women and men here today, it's a reflection of how far we have gone and also at the same time, how far we need to go still to bring about racial equality with all individuals, regardless of who you are and where you come from
7843	Allen	Benjamin	70	YCiZz_ZRK7I	0	27	Thank you so much for coming. I really do appreciate it. Okay, so this gets us back to our fantastic panel. I really appreciate everyone's comments and thoughts. I would love to ask Professor Sonenshein, but the other folks can comment on this too, Professor Levinson, why is it that we have a registration process, voter registration process, when, I know in Mexico, for example, you turn 18, you're automatically...
7844	Williams	Das	12	AY2GGpXPzCw	134	145	Further, as the state moves towards the 75% diversion goal, the resulting reduction in disposal will cause a sharp decline in tipping fee revenue which supports Cal Recycle's oversight of disposal and recycling.
7845	Hertzberg	Robert	99	20R5DjZ86C8	156	176	And in responding to the last question, why do we even need the PUC anymore? And I don't say that in anything other than all of us need to fundamentally reexamine, that's not to say that there's certain protections.
7846	Chau	Ed	116	R3SMzNAvRKs	738	751	AB 90 designates the Department of Housing and Community Development, or HCD, as the state agency responsible for administering new federal funding for affordable housing through The Federal Housing Trust Fund or The Trust Fund.
7847	Hertzberg	Robert	99	20R5DjZ86C8	176	195	You may have to do things differently in a rural area because the changes, because the demands are so different. You just said that you're trying to decide the issue concerning the oversupply, and we've got such a disbursement of agencies, it makes more sense. Telecom industries completely different and are regulated completely different than used to be.
7848	Huff	Bob	105	iJc5cTYtc4Q	211	223	So it's time for us to establish that transportation is a priority. These are funds that are being paid by truckers to fix infrastructure. That's where it ought to go. That's what this does as well as protecting any new revenues.
7849	McCarty	Kevin	22	vosSMVWPV7M	1657	1673	So, I'll get right to it, to the LAO. Your proposal on page five, that's really not the Department of Finances or, that's kind of a hybrid type thing that you're laying out as far as options for the Legislature?
7850	Gipson	Mike	28	xQtK7XDQgbs	1342	1369	Before I call on Senator Roth, I think that what you 're hearing and I'm gonna echo, how can I feed my kid, how can I feed my neighbor's kids, if my own children are going hungry? And so, how can we do all of the things out of state, when we have children and students here that need these opportunities provided to them, right here at home, in the most diverse state in America? Senator Roth.
7851	Liu	Carol	63	qCvvxF6FLEU	960	996	SB 527 provides additional spec, specivity [phonetic] regarding the awarding of the safe neighborhoods and schools grant. The bill targets the funding of the grants toward LEAs who have developed 3-year plans in their local control accountability plans to establish research-based school-wide strategies addressing social, emotional and behavioral issues. These include approaches such as school-wide positive behavior interventions and supports, restorative practices, community school strategies, school-based mental health programs and trauma informed practices.
7852	Grove	Shannon	77	Ve6b2OIjftM	838	848	Sounds pretty simple. If you go there, your name's not listed, you have the right to cast a provisional ballot. You have the right to cast a ballot if you are present in the line of a voting place prior to the close of the close of the polls.
7853	Block	Marty	59	AuGnonUgy28	274	291	Thank you. Questions regarding the enrollment study? See none. Any public comment regarding the enrollment study? Seeing none, we'll move to item number 12. Item number 12, California Dream Loan Funding. And for this, we will start with the Department of Finance.
7854	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	D-f_MBSX4FM	1492	1514	or use some of the methods that have been employed to avoid the harshness of prop 209 on the state side, that we can't get those local higher goals fulfilled and labor, labor organization maybe a part of subsequent panels and, or certainly a part of the conversation, but I don't know if any of you have
7855	Nielsen	Jim	68	BdgXqTHNkdY	1168	1193	He worked hard over the years to get those things into our budget process. He is survived by his wife, Sandy. A wonderful 38 year marriage. Willim and Samantha, Sarah daughter, and his grandson Jacob Peter. Now, it's very special that Peter's name will live on in the name of his grandson.
7856	Nguyen	Janet	65	QkQlxH8U7IE	1326	1342	Then I mean I heard the concern from you and the senator. I'm willing to work with the committee to find amendments that we can appropriately address these concerns, especially when it comes to the First Amendment that has been put into analysis.
7857	Wieckowski	Bob	55	jna-qIkO0Wg	826	842	We're not gonna have as much snowfall. I mean, one is the predictive data that we're gonna, or predictability about that. But, isn't another element is the, if we're in the field of resiliency, is how do we build our structures?
7858	De Leon	Kevin	102	SU8_KAMcIaE	960	971	Now, the issue with regards to economic growth, especially in an area with high unemployment rates is a really critical issue and I don't think there's a perfect answer.
7859	Stone	Jeff	26	J_Iq4rTF6rc	1161	1202	I can? Would you like to come up Chris? Okay, so my staff has review, the committees are not, per diem based. And these are the commissions that we came up with, and this is where we came up with the recommendation.
7860	Beall	Jim	92	i7abTEXGU1E	100	119	Mr. Chairman thank you for taking this bill up. This is California enacted in 2003. The cigarette tobacco products licensing act, established a statewide licensing program administered by the Board of Equalization.
7861	Olsen	Kristin	15	6y6CtxPlgMo	391	401	And then at the same time, evaluating their performance and providing them with meaningful feedback on how they can improve to make sure that we're having student success in California. With that, respectfully ask for your aye vote.
7862	Stone	Jeff	26	6XCg5Ws00TU	587	603	Okay. Well, I hope there's some way we can legislatively fix that because obviously one of the goals is to save the taxpayers' money, but I also don't wanna take away from the growing need of taking care of a developmentally-disabled communities that we are trying to help out.
7863	Lara	Ricardo	107	cXnV6IOLWSg	1427	1450	Thank you, Madam President. Members, AB 1352 allows a person to have their record expunged if they complete the deferred entry of judgment requirements. Current law already prohibits the record of a person who has completed the entry judgement requirements to be used in such a way that could result in a denial of
7864	Chau	Ed	116	v8Lqd5JpuF0	1908	1930	So I think it's not a bad idea to be proactive in our approach. And if we need to wait six to nine months to redo the certification, if they lose the designation, then I think we're losing of lot of care for these patients. So this is a, also a proactive approach. So with that I'd like to ask for your Aye vote.
7865	Thurmond	Tony	4	ljTMAR3_jHw	1592	1608	My second question. This I honestly cannot remember, if you qualify to be served at a Regional Center, is that an entitlement? Is that considered an entitlement in the same way that we have other, you know, I spent the last four years working for a mental health agency that uses MediCal.
7866	Mitchell	Holly	64	k4GcCA0Jbo4	1581	1594	But I would counter their arguments by pointing out that under my bill more cases would be kept in state, in which case the state would not need to split seizure pro, seizure proceeds with the federal government.
7867	Allen	Benjamin	70	7wM-SWUAGJQ	1411	1428	California's community health clinics offer unique option for low-income patients to receive quality, affordable medical care. Clinics that dispense medication on-site provide the added benefit of a one-stop shop that allows patients to leave their healthcare provider with medication in hand.
7868	Mullin	Kevin	31	DgVvXUz7n-U	397	427	Mr. Holden is asking for an aye vote. Mr. Gallagher is asking for a no vote. Mr. Holden is asking for an aye vote. Mr. Gallagher is asking for a no vote, this requires a majority of those present and voting. Requires a majority of those present and voting. Clerk will close the roll. Ayes 41, Nos 28. The ruling of the chair is upheld. Ms. Brown you have the floor.
7869	Chavez	Rocky	83	y1QKa01q6Wg	1649	1679	Senator Lara, I'd like to thank you for highlighting an issue. It's clearly it's an emotional issue, I've watched the recent discussion here. But I'd like to just go back to some specifics on your bill. You mentioned that part of this bill is a waiver to the Feds for reimbursement. Can you tell me in preparation of this bill over the past couple years, what those discussions have shown?
7870	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	Oggr1OKYFzQ	2193	2208	This was a lengthy, and sometimes contentious hearing, but everyone gave it a great shot and I appreciate your effort and your patience. So, with that, let's call those measures that have, still are open.
7871	Wolk	Lois	94	oTonvRu6EKM	1175	1190	One thing that's been suggested is that the State Water Board come up with a model, some kind of model ordinance, that would assist those kinds of agencies that don't have the adequate lawyering to be able to do it. Any thoughts, Lester, or we'll move on.
7872	Hancock	Loni	98	JI861kYqkEk	1239	1266	Finally,  I am interested in how we can extend the opportunity for community college education to correctional staff. I guess that model was in New York State and I wondered if you're looking at that at all. I think it would probably be good for everybody.
7873	Weber	Shirley	44	kJUQLNRw8o8	1244	1259	I know we did that with the early edge in terms of if you get in early there's a cost, but then you save money going forward. Because kids are no longer in need of intensive care. I, I a question I ask is this, for the those in the system is this a better method?
7874	Dahle	Brian	47	ch3qK2_FbyA	582	602	Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I have to rise in fairly opposition, I guess I would say. I think that the program that we had under AB 32 did not serve the rate payers and the taxpayers of California well. If we're going to lead the nation and the world in reducing carbon, we need have a little better policy than what we had
7875	Beall	Jim	92	QKPlYzaLDfo	109	118	Is, is there, we'll, we'll find out I guess in the May revise, but, but you are looking into that, correct? We have a letter signed by 41 legislators on this issue.
7876	Eggman	Susan Talamantes	73	PclGdiV7D64	515	525	I, I'd just like to say about Mr. Cooley, I wanna thank you for your thoughtful vision on this. I think this is one of those things that resonate with people both from a business perspective, as well as a populace perspective.
7877	Fuller	Jean	49	fkvme1Ux-zg	638	669	of 2015. The President's Award is the highest honor a paramedic can receive at Hall Ambulance, and represents a continuous commitment to customer satisfaction. Armando Lazaro is a paramedic relief supervisor for Hall Ambulance Service. Armando was nominated for the Star of Life after saving himself and other victims from an accident. And, Makenzie Stevens is a flight nurse
7878	Nielsen	Jim	68	TtIXT0N3vvo	1133	1149	And that's a pretty awesome burden for just somebody that's been working for a local agency and now they're sent out to enforce this, to be the water police for the State of California. And really for the state of California. The local authority just being empowered by the state to do the state's work, I would argue.
7879	Mendoza	Tony	52	hDgm6cKL8i4	83	102	We also have the state auditor and the State Legislative Analyst's Office to discuss the various challenges EDD has faced over the last decade and provide some policy recommendations. EDD will also have a chance to respond afterwards.
7880	Gipson	Mike	28	iq_O5tryJ2s	710	821	And I have a hard time understanding why your department can't implement something like that for nursing homes. I don't care if it's three people at the nursing home. You can still suggest that there should be x amount of skilled individuals to handle, to monitor, to watch that patient. And I'm very frustrated because at some point I may need a facility. And damn it, I would like to have someone to take care of my butt when, in fact, in that facility, that's gonna watch and monitor me. So if I want it now, then I should want it for the individuals who has to go to these facilities now. There should not be an answer given, at least while I'm on the committee, that you don't know or you can't provide the kind of answer that will address. I haven't even heard you say that we will add it into a plan. We will suggest it at our next roundtable discussion, or we will have it at our next staff meeting, something. But to suggest that once we leave from here, it's just a question that's out there in the wind, that's unacceptable. It's unacceptable. Mr. Chair and Madam Chair, I don't know what has to take place in order for that to be part of a policy. If they can't do it, then we should be able to do it. And if we can't do it, then damn it, we need legislation that demands and directs them to do it, because patients' care is in jeopardy as a result of that being absent. And if the hospitals can do it, why can't you do it? That's all.
7881	Hueso	Ben	48	8s6GBqKeNwE	686	708	that there are just some antennas, because of their location geographically, they are unsightly. But not all antennas require the same height. They don't require the same design. Some can be hidden very easily into the urban environment. Those are permitted now. I don't think those have ever had a problem being permitted.
7882	Hertzberg	Robert	99	qTf-RqJKEFo	588	597	going to say "Oh, look at what these guys did!" when all you're trying to do is to make sure there's enough money to actually implement a program and not be held hostage because I'm worried about,
7883	Wood	Jim	72	TYBUIhFGo6I	1066	1078	And then also heard about the challenges of applications and agencies and programs, and how difficult that is to navigate, especially challenging in rural communities, I know that firsthand.
7884	Pavley	Fran	104	cRT-vVNBfAE	940	957	So I for one, will use my chairmanship on my water committee on the next year and a half to continue to monitor this. But this is critically important, and I think it's important that the public knows this. I'll be supporting this as a first step, but this shouldn't be the last step.
7885	Wood	Jim	72	TYBUIhFGo6I	1078	1128	Mr. Chou knows this, so my challenge is with the Housing and Community Development in the State of California. And the challenge is, once again, of rural communities having a difficult time accessing, they don't have the resources to actually adequately get through the process. So we're making it much more difficult on the communities that need these technologies the most to an honorous process that we need to figure out ways to break down. And we also need to figure out ways to break down the funding to get these funds where they need to go. So thank you to all of our panelists and I'd like to give opportunity for those who have questions to come forward and on comments I'm not gonna be able to address the public comments today, but we will be taking notes, and we will address those as we go forward, so anyone who has public comment, please come forward.
7886	Chu	Kansen	32	ImdbglqlDDQ	873	905	AB 385 will ensure that the group will continue to meet. They have convened their first meeting in April and just as of yesterday I was talking to the operator of one of the facilities, and they are having difficulty to get the second meeting going in July, because they're involved with so many different agencies. So hoping that codifying that will ensure that the group will continue to meet.
7887	Nielsen	Jim	68	XQwWN6GsS_M	791	807	And the medical needs of that valley are unique and vast as well and I indeed will say, very unique. And Senator Cannella has long tried to achieve this accomplishment as well as many others, and it's certainly appropriate to continue the trend.
7888	De Leon	Kevin	102	OOj1xAhpXgw	81	108	And, you gotta pay for those enrollment slots. And, especially on the issue of the dearth of diversity, especially at the UC level, if we open up more slots we can encourage those students from impoverished neighborhoods, urban as well as rural areas to apply and to get into the system, but once you get into the system whether it's a Cal State or a UC school, obviously the question's about affordability.
7889	De Leon	Kevin	102	DDRuG0CC7zE	1844	1859	If, you know, dependent disproportionate on international students as opposed to domestic, California, Southern California students. I don't know what that is, you know, we don't have to get into details about that but how come some schools have a more of a reputation than others?
7890	Salas	Rudy	34	FVQ4YG_BqFE	1930	1945	Okay, so under your understanding then the state fire marshal would have that authority in the future to decide what the best method for annually testing these pipelines is. Whether that be the smart peg or some other technology, or the hydro
7891	Mullin	Kevin	31	3bQ_hUBlpio	25	36	The Assembly is now in session. Assembly Member Garcia notices the absence of a quorum. The sergeants at arms will prepare the chamber and bring in the absent members. The clerk will call the roll
7892	Thurmond	Tony	4	gvsFAuMIegs	1223	1247	But first, I'd like to ask the authors to have a chance to address some of the concerns that were raised by those who serve individuals with developmental disabilities, cuz I know that both authors have worked very hard and are very committed, like many of us, to supporting those individuals, and before jumping into it, I'd like to give them an opportunity to address their thoughts there.
7893	McGuire	Mike	93	J0kwSkFFMEE	1181	1209	It's the least funded program in public high schools in California and we're now going to fund it potentially less, less than $375 million from last year. So, I think it is absolutely critical that we walk our talk and we also need to hold school districts accountable to ensure that they're finding this critical program when it comes the jobs in the economy California.
7894	Bloom	Richard	2	t0rNuwc0CtA	1006	1021	But, the fact of the matter is you were directed in this process to do zero-based budgeting this year. And you've read I'm sure the critique of the LAO and the staff report that's before us today.
7895	Gordon	Richard	117	a4X1msw4NL8	648	663	Senate amendments added a January first 2020 sunset on the cost year caps and tier definitions. Recent amendments also limited tier definitions to apply only to the individual small group market significantly narrowing this provision.
7896	Stone	Jeff	26	npLG8Ena6eQ	729	768	It's a dating antihistamine. They can go to their local liquor store and buy a six-pack of beer. They can take the entire bottle of benadryl, enjoy their beer and before the sixth beer is drunk they will have a fatal overdose. A terminal patient receiving oxycodone for their pain can easily take an entire stock bottle prescribed by their Doctor with a cocktail of their choice and achieve the same outcome.
7897	Hernandez	Ed	103	7ULUe19PTjQ	26	37	To Senator Wolk. And then what I'll do, as soon as I see a member, then I'll stop because I traditionally present my bills at the end. But so we can save some time, I will go ahead and get started.
7898	Gray	Adam	27	vYi2KRFuGjg	45	70	And only on the land held in trust for the tribe as of the execution date of this compact. This compact requires payment into Indian gaming special distribution fund for reimbursement costs to the state, to regulate and enforce the requirements within the compact.
7899	Holden	Chris	78	a4X1msw4NL8	44	49	Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I request unanimous consent to suspend joint rule 62A, the file notice requirements to allow the Human Services Committee to meet and to hear Senate Bill 548 De Leon today, September 11th upon call of the chair in a room to be determined.
7900	Chang	Ling Ling	18	qCEr8jDp5Hg	289	299	Where California can certainly not be called average is its cost of housing and homeownership. Second only to Hawaii, California has one of the highest costs of housing in the country.
7901	Mitchell	Holly	64	eb2YaRQ7J5Y	1349	1365	Thank you very much, we're gonna hold this item open pending, may revise, and perhaps the finalization of the court case. We'll now move on to, developmental centers, issue one. This is an informational item, page five of the agenda.
7902	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	b7XHatlYhkw	477	491	I know it's just a resolution, but I think It is incumbent upon this entire state, and I don't understand the partisan, that this could be a partisan issue. This is an issue about democracy, first, foremost, and fundamentally.
7903	Bonta	Rob	85	ok4qN3L6USs	620	634	On an average school day in California, 4.3 million or three out of four students miss out on the health and academic benefits of school breakfast. And at least 2.2 million of these students are California's most vulnerable children.
7904	Medina	Jose	81	8ZmrJUXXU4k	606	629	First, let me thank the author for accepting the amendments that clarified for UC what is accepted for, or restricted, in the bill and giving UC still more flexibility in bringing in the kind of cultural and arts that we spoke about when the bill came to a higher ed
7905	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	2D0v6cuDbfE	1523	1539	That's why this bill I think is so helpful because what it does it is says to business owners, who otherwise are unaware that they are in violation of ADA, that they are needing to correct the problem so that people have access.
7906	Mitchell	Holly	64	7Nve54D7sWM	2009	2030	Let's move on to item number three. Colleagues, we are, the staff's recommendation that we take action on items three, four, five, six, and seven, as you're aware. And again, we'll take public comment at the end of item seven. So Trailer Bill 600, continued suspension of fingerprint licensing, the exemption.
7907	Alejo	Luis	9	5E8YMvh3dfU	1509	1519	Thank you gentlemen and I would appreciate any communications you want to provide my office or any of the other members of the community, you know, please provide directly to us, that would be great.
7908	Mitchell	Holly	64	H1s_v6dAj4A	660	670	And one consistent message we've gotten from the first two panels is this effort requires a sustained effort and we must boost wages and income that leads to our third panelist.
7909	Wagner	Donald	88	xuTeMXcZRA0	793	805	Yeah, this may not be addressing this bill, but it might with the amendment, so let me ask it. You said there's a misdemeanor right now if a non law enforcement person tampers with a video. Is that your understanding?
7910	Quirk	Bill	23	kGJrWtDlyMM	2036	2047	Thank you for bringing this forward. I would very much hope that budget sub two makes this part of the appropriation process. Do you know if it has been done so far?
7911	Holden	Chris	78	nGcU-tnoqVY	1223	1231	and so to have a firm cap seemed to be an area that he thought we needed to be responsive to. And that's how we ended up with that reflected in the bill.
7912	De Leon	Kevin	102	mgO95LX_sqE	200	217	As we all know, Mr. Chair as well as colleagues, we are in an extraordinary session to deal with the issue of the crumbling infrastructure. We surely don't know what the outcome will be. But the folks in LA County are ahead of the curve irrespective of what the outcome is in the extraordinary session.
7913	Wieckowski	Bob	55	nGcU-tnoqVY	1231	1251	I guess the question's for some of the franchisees who aren't here is that we're looking at the contract. And the day the contract are amended and that effective date. How about the actual dispute, the incident? Because it seems to me that there'll be some franchisees who entered the contract five years ago, right?
7914	Nielsen	Jim	68	oyj26fO_o0A	701	721	That they were not nurtured, cared for and because of that wounded heart they drifted off into bad things, and one of the failures of the California Youth Authority, of years ago, had all kinds of programs, but they did not have programs I found that dealt with a broken heart. That really is an important thing.
7915	McGuire	Mike	93	_Bb4hK8XVqo	1033	1050	Thank you so much and do appreciate Senator Bates for bringing this forward and the Committee as well as the Chair working on this. I wanna echo some of the concerns that Senator Berryhill had just brought forward. So out of seven counties within the north district, only two are self-help. Every other county is extremely poor.
7916	Waldron	Marie	29	i1dEPEL80sQ	37	53	Okay thank you Mr. Chair and Committee members. I'm here today to present AB362 which would create a pilot project for printing by the Department of General Services Office of State printing.
7917	McGuire	Mike	93	_Bb4hK8XVqo	1066	1084	So that's where I'm concerned in regards to this one specific proposal in how that would look to be able to help amend because they're already in a world of hurt and unable to dig out. They don't have the dollars to be able to put up.
7918	Beall	Jim	92	LNIc8kuNihE	59	100	Now, to get that information, we had to really work hard to get the information out of the Department of Social Services. It took us several months of work. And I appreciate everybody that participated in that. But we got the information, and it was rather interesting, Mr. Chairman, that the difference between a group home and a family care home was an astounding four times to five times more use of psychotropic drugs in the group homes as opposed to the foster care family homes.
7919	Kim	Young	82	HccZsvAseDo	1319	1336	Mr. Speaker and members. I also rise in support of ACR19 as a member of the very proud API Caucus. Throughout the weekend I also participated in many lunar new year celebrations throughout my district, which is one of the most vibrant and diverse in probably all the entire State of California.
7920	Galgiani	Cathleen	95	162iDtQT3ZE	1161	1174	And a lot of people were going missing then. And so it was in large part to address that problem. So I'm glad that your bill is structured in a way that it allows local governments still the ability to make decisions about which ones to keep.
7921	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	UpjsW9YiW28	1038	1066	How about if we do this, that you agree to these amendments, they're in print, and what we will do is, under subsection C it says for the purposes of subdivision B, negligible shall mean not more than 5%, but not greater than 10% if you can show that you cannot get that material, or that parts of that product in the United States. Can we agree on that?
7922	Stone	Mark	20	ZhE_hzRecAQ	1400	1422	Madame president, one of the most precious rights we have as American citizens is the right to vote. How many hundreds of thousands of lives have been lost in wars defending our liberties and our freedoms that allow us to serve in this democratic society that we have today.
7923	Gomez	Jimmy	80	2b3SgDbb8jI	1573	1596	Thank you so much for that answer. Any other questions or comments from committee members? Seeing none, we have a motion by Calderon, a second by Wood. This bill is out on the A roll call with Gallagher not, voting no. Mr. Thurmond, you're up.
7924	Mitchell	Holly	64	5oljCvpfO9A	282	302	The working families in this building, in the session we go to midnight, one, two o'clock in the morning, budget season, have challenges. I did as a young mother lobbying here. I had a newborn baby on my shoulder sitting in budget sub-one hearings on Sundays, because I didn't have a family daycare that was twenty four hours seven days a week.
7925	Leyva	Connie	62	gvvbkQTOc28	173	187	One, the state is currently working towards increasing our renewable portfolio standard from 33 to 50% which as you know means a greater reliance on renewable energy, specifically solar.
7926	Gomez	Jimmy	80	JgpqDSrKaXw	1681	1707	AB 75, Cooper, Pest Control Research Program do pass. A roll call. AB 779, Cristina Garcia's Guidelines for Transit Priority Areas do pass with amendments replacing existing provisions with a provision authorizing OPR to determine the transportation impact for residential and mixed use projects and transit priority areas are not significant.  Republicans not voting.
7927	Mitchell	Holly	64	OIbMOKdbCjk	1753	1771	Thank you madam President. I rise today to adjourn in memory of Vern Watkins. Mr. Watkins was born in Detroit in the late 1930's. After earning a Bachelor's Degree from Wayne State University, he became one of the first black little type operators in the graphic arts international union.
7928	Weber	Shirley	44	BvL-PHidNXM	1124	1149	It's really kinda strange that we would pass something and approve it, and allow it to happen, and that we don't have the mechanisms to make it happen, and that's, this is one of those small things that you do that basically upgrades our system and allows the payroll systems to basically compensate the individuals who done the over time work that's there. That right now they're not able to do. So that's where we are.
7929	McCarty	Kevin	22	dmXNh5hsX-E	1348	1368	Thank you. Seeing no other questions, we will proceed now to issue number 2, state special schools, which we touched on a bit in issue number 1. So, we'll begin with Ms. Ehlers with LAO again.
7930	Waldron	Marie	29	SmBGHTADUL4	1449	1475	Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'll try to be brief, but I've written so many notes, so bear with me. Just to start off regarding the developmental disabilities folks. I can't remember, which committee I was in, but we did support, I supported whole-heartedly a bill, I believe it was Senator Hancock had, about instead of having people with developmental
7931	Mathis	Devon	75	3Luw7tOrBzg	1063	1082	That's where that standard accreditation across the board needs to come into play. Because those are the core classes that students take, and a lot of students, especially military, they'll be stationed over here for six months or a year.
7932	Roth	Richard	106	1XQMI2ofb7Y	9	18	On the healthcare issue, I obviously share the concern of my colleagues about reimbursement rates but in addition, to having physicians receive appropriate amounts of money for the care that they provide,
7933	Gipson	Mike	28	Htnfsa9QnRM	52	83	Given the intersection between these two populations, if we can agree that the most vulnerability of the foster youth is worth addressing, we can also agree that the homeless youth are just as important. With that in mind, AB 1228 seeks to expand current law to include homeless youth, with an understanding of the often overlooked intersection between the two populations.
7934	Rodriguez	Freddie	69	j_cwUXYUJzk	385	401	It is also intended to have intelligent routing calls so that calls may be directed to the closest dispatcher center. The state will have to fund these efforts with some experts estimating the costs between 300 million to 500 million, and that could take up to several years to complete.
7935	Wolk	Lois	94	SvIBnS8_PpY	350	368	We don't want to do that. Parks are important to so many members of the legislature and to the people of this state. And it seems as if we don't have a plan, the administration doesn't have a plan. Where are we going on parks?
7936	Pan	Richard	96	g_HgBg8yC5k	349	357	So, Senator Hancock, I wanna thank you so much for bringing this bill foward. I think it's very important we create more opportunities for people with disabilities. Would you like to close?
7937	Dodd	Bill	71	mxsKkg9J8wc	864	883	Mr. Chair and Members, existing law requires a county sealer to test weighing and measuring devices used, or sold, in the county for commercial purposes. This includes those used away, or measure packages used for commercial purposes, to determine whether they contain the amount indicated on the packaging.
7938	Maienschein	Brian	84	ZZs409-zmok	1271	1333	Thank you, Madam Chairwoman and members. Key information maintained by local governments on business licences, council agendas and budgets are frequently kept in file formats that make them difficult to find or analyze using contemporary internet tools, and other technology. The current guidelines for posting these documents predate the Xerox machine, and thus are inadequate in the modern era. The concept of open data describes data that are free available, machine readable, and formatted according to national technical standards to facilitate visibility and reuse of published data. This concept allows access to standardized data that can be easily retrieved, downloaded, sorted, searched, analyzed, redistributed, and used by individuals or businesses or researchers or journalists and governments, to use a single data table, or combinations of data tables. Making local government data available online using open standards will increase transparency, and make transactions more effective and accountable to the public.
7939	Gallagher	James	108	7UN1Ta_jlck	393	422	Well, Mr. Speaker as I said in my opening, you know, I know we're all focused on the drought right now, but there is a real prospect of flood, as well. There's a lot of people talking about an El Nino coming next year, so it's important we continue to maintain our flood control structures as well. This bill will do that. And, believe me there is still drainage that happens we have had rain, just not enough of it.
7940	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	emhy9UKtKg0	57	220	Or did he just leave as well? Let's give it a minute, see if we can, yeah. So the chair will be voting in support. Yes, with the significant amendments taken, yes. Busy day. Deja Vu, AB 15 take two. Calling file item one, AB 15, with Assemblymember Holden present. We have been discussing this measure.
7941	Mitchell	Holly	64	FHGwb8kBog8	251	269	And so even if you're ask is going to be this, at least present a plan so we can begin to really understand what it takes. Because I don't believe the Legislature understands that, and we have a knee-jerk reaction when you come in and ask for a dollar amount and we go into this back and forth, can you do without this?
7942	Patterson	Jim	119	YZmREa72UrQ	257	283	The Department of the Interior says fighting fires in California could cost $200 million more this year than the amount budgeted. When firefighting costs exceed budget projections, federal agencies borrow from other accounts meant to fund prevention projects. Let me turn the page. Land management in order to make ends meet.
7943	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	voBhKCc4qds	1436	1446	Could you share with us a little bit about your experience and the type of client you represent and the type of employer and situation that you generally experience?
7944	Campos	Nora	76	lr5iK8Kvlcs	906	918	When you have to go to the city manager and say why aren't our minority businesses having the ability to build on these contracts that are million dollar contracts to build an infrastructure?
7945	De Leon	Kevin	102	GC6hApRO4Yg	1568	1603	As a result, thousands of California born U.S. citizens children living in their parents country of origin have faced many barriers to integration, specifically in the mexican educational system. This resolution outlines the Senate's commitment to participate in meetings with the Mexican officials to identify the specific challenges migrants face in the education system, identify best practices for integration, and provide psychological as well as emotional support to these U.S. born California Children who now currently reside in the republic of Mexico.
7946	Campos	Nora	76	lr5iK8Kvlcs	918	931	Whether it's the City of San Jose, or a BART project, or a light rail project or any of those. So that's what I'm trying to understand, because just putting pressure.
7947	Mitchell	Holly	64	Mt9BcU600uM	1394	1472	Thank you, Mr. President. First of all, I wanted to apologize. You know that I take my appointment to this committee very seriously. It was only because of my personal loss that I wasn't here last week. Please know that I take my appointment seriously. I also wanted to say for the record that I reviewed, I asked the staff to brief me on last week's hearing, and the issue that came up in the confirmation for the deputy director of Department of Developmental Disabilities is an issue that I have heard repeatedly serving as a budget sub-chair in the assembly. What concerns me is that it's an issue we continue to hear in this legislative body and I'm very sorry I wasn't here, but I hope that either in the context of the confirmation for the director, the new director, in the budget discussion, in some context that we as a legislature can hear a report from the department about the allegations that have been very public. We've al read about them in the paper, that the allegations of abuse and maltreatment that are taking place in those facilities. It has come up, like I said the 3 years I chaired the subcommittee, it came up every year.
7948	Bloom	Richard	2	Q7LdbTCujmM	0	17	Well, as you might have noticed we are a little bit shorthanded at the moment, but we are going to begin meeting. We will begin with the presentations, establish a quorum, when we're able to do that, and then deal with other formalities of voting on the vote only calendar and items as they come up.
7949	Nguyen	Janet	65	gDPCmEU7pmg	591	628	And I appreciate the effort. I'm just more of, you know, call it for what it is. If you want two public members, call it two public members. Don't call it two individual affected areas because that, to me, is disingenuous, it really is. I'm, like I said, I'm a big fan of the bill in terms of your concept in trying to revitalize these neighborhoods, but let's not do it while we are making these statements that's not accurate and it's incorrect. It should just be two public members because you can't...
7950	Leno	Mark	60	o0ZtwE0t4Uk	1261	1272	And just to complete that, and that sort of also does tails into your comments with regard to, "we should not managing drought as an emergency it's with us to stay."
7951	McGuire	Mike	93	qbDN-8u61LI	1340	1354	My father is a retired San Francisco police officer. My uncle is a retired DEA agent. My cousin, who's like a brother to me, is a detective sergeant in Santa Clara. And my uncle is retired lieutenant with San Jose P.D. So, law enforcement it's really personal to me, because it's my family.
7952	Stone	Jeff	26	PdAu9Oh2C5Q	2230	2246	They told me, in fact I'm emailing one back and forth. Mr. Chairman, they actually have no use of their hands, and they email with the utilization of glasses that they have an optical mouse and we've developed a friendship. So I just want to make sure, Mr. Chairman, we are not going to be hurting homes like this.
7953	Thurmond	Tony	4	89bDX7qtwgo	558	573	I've been thinking about this a lot, and I think I'm moving away from the question of how much will it cost in increased rates. I'm more interested now in what is the cost of not increasing rates. On physical health. On dental health.
7954	Stone	Mark	20	oObwrA_56LI	999	1019	I thought, "Well if that is true, that is something we can solve." A lot of laws in California already recognize bias against the transgender as a problem, but in the peremptory challenge in the jury selection process and remember the jury selection process is a cornerstone to our justice system.
7955	Nguyen	Janet	65	1E-hERPJ9VM	1073	1089	The child can just sit, or an adult can sit in on a folding chair, and you can get your dental cleaning as well. So there's different options, and so I just want to just know, because it is limited funds. It's a great program. It's the right thing to do.
7956	Bigelow	Frank	91	-Nb5xJu_Rq4	1030	1059	Whether they're just simply injured or more critically injured. Those are horrible situations and in all of those cases it's become very evident it's the lack of restraint and the proper care of our young children. In many cases by their own parents. Hopefully, this will help stop and stem some of that tragic, brutality that occurs to youth. So anyway, I applaud you.
7957	De Leon	Kevin	102	pmq1wDNXXkw	948	966	If you're a coastal resident you had that financial wherewithal, you know, to purchase a ZEV whether it's a Tesla, and then you draw down on that rebate, so kind of like, we don't know that policy wise that's the most fiscally prudent thing to do.
7958	Mitchell	Holly	64	fEtYfq6bYXw	683	695	And those of us who heard Michelle's testimony, I have quoted her already a number of times, will never forget her compelling story. Thank you very much for that. Any questions? Senator Monning? Any public comment? Yes, sir?
7959	Cannella	Anthony	61	tX-iRiZ5OnY	1403	1456	What Bob's saying is that the money that we're putting into this should all go to road maintenance and you can make that argument, but there's, let's call it $2 billion just for argument sake. $2 billion in cap and trade, there's another $1 billion in transportation, weight fees or truck weight fees. Seems to me, this is a no brainer. If our commuters, rural commuters especially, are using these roads, they're getting hammered. That money should be going to roads.
7960	De Leon	Kevin	102	pmq1wDNXXkw	966	984	But in terms of how you measure and quantify, CO2 emissions, most likely someone who lives in San Joaquin Valley or in an urban environment is driving a vehicle that's much older, and because it's much older, the emissions are incredibly higher.
7961	Huff	Bob	105	4RPfdYzqQQc	1621	1642	On the one hand, we want UC to keep their tuition costs down. We want them to have an affordable tuition rate for our kids, we want to restrict out-of-state students, keep more slots here. And then today with this act, we want to drive up the cost of the UC's, who by the way, it may be good for them according to one speaker, but they're opposing this, this is gonna drive up their costs.
7962	Hueso	Ben	48	8_h1Rf31Czc	1160	1177	So if there's ever a business concept that has nobody that has a capacity with nobody in there, and they expect not to have anybody in there, and they function in a, in a way that doesn't have anybody in the building, well, they don't, they're not required to have a defibrillator.
7963	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	XDaCgfUVUtA	512	524	one of you have to bear and that they understand the regulatory process and appreciate that this is gonna take at least, what is that, 18, 19 months, before we actually see a project that bond hits.
7964	Stone	Jeff	26	2MXVIex_Zeg	615	627	Madam Chair, I'm going to vote no. Not because it is not the appropriate thing to vote yes, but it is just a protest vote with the federal government that just places so many mandates on us for federal funds. I know you support the philosophy of the no votes-
7965	Holden	Chris	78	9mjyTPfbhPw	516	525	The issue of this bill being before the body has been determined by the Chair and been voted on. I ask that the speaker stay focused on the issues and not drift back in to that subject matter.
7966	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	7vSg9-FP5Qk	940	975	We've got to come up with more holistic way of dealing with this, so these guys don't come back. How do we ensure that they don't come back? And if it means changing the way you're trained, if it means then going back again to your culture and you have officers that think beyond kind of the Dirty Harry kind of approach. And get into that kindler, gentler officer or at least that, I like to say that smarter, brighter officer then let's get to that. And let's get to that pretty quick. So thank you, Mr. Chairman, for putting this together.
7967	Perea	Henry	33	x_nA6Vz0FIc	514	527	I'll leave it up to the author decide if that's something the author wants to accept, but, I'm certainly willing to put a motion on the table to move this bill forward as amended by the Chair, because I do think it makes a lot of important changes.
7968	Pavley	Fran	104	AGRN7-GFw2A	1293	1316	The bill was amended to reflect what came out of a study that was all agreed to and paid for by a per barrel fee as required under S.B. 4. They had brought up some, really need to focus on closing data gaps so that we could Make some minor reforms to protect ground water.
7969	Fuller	Jean	49	LTEBLbyRjnQ	1895	1914	Right now, school districts can allow students to do this but they must follow the ed code, they must satisfy the requirements for minutes of P.E., they must satisfy the credentialed teacher overseeing them, and they must set up a criteria, andif the school district teachers, usually it's the P.E. teachers,
7970	Kim	Young	82	toyLEHK5bMU	517	540	Thank you Mr. Speaker and members. I rise in strong opposition to this bill. This bill, what it does is it's really forcing us, the legislators to pick winners and losers. And more importantly we are given the information on this legislation just hours before we were asked to vote on this
7971	Hall	Isadore	1	H5As3s88-Eg	1	20	Thank you, I'm also proud to support this measure. I think we're in a critical time where these centers, it's do or die for them, quite honestly. And the need to diversify the services and the role that they play in our community is essential.
7972	Alejo	Luis	9	NPktHkkmjlQ	921	945	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I also wanna commend our Senate President Pro Tem on this bill. Previous versions of this bill as our chair of this committee did a lot of work on last year's version, and even when I was a member of the Labor and Employment Committee we authored AB 1386, that gave more power to the Labor Commissioner to be able to impose liens after
7973	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	E2qxwCiVZM4	1663	1691	 Anybody else in support? Thank you. The opposition, if we have any witnesses in opposition they come forward. And members of the public in opposition, if they can line up at the microphone now so we could expedite things. You may proceed.
7974	Garcia	Eduardo	38	g07XaAgsb-U	906	920	What is working? What are we doing in California, aside from the weather conditions and the quality of life that we have here. What are we doing that is working in that has you doing business in California?
7975	Gallagher	James	108	-OpN4Uo7BxE	862	875	And the reason for that was because we had an air force base and there was disparities between population and registrations in that counties. It took them years to finally get off pre clearance at great cost.
7976	Linder	Eric	39	6gxr39Gyjlk	374	388	AB 1171 authorizes regional transportation agencies with expressway projects in their sales tax expenditure plans and that are not on the state highway system to utilize the construction manager/general contractor procurement method.
7977	Hueso	Ben	48	knCQGn-OW5c	919	945	So there's a synergy that can be developed and it is developing in which the high tech components are made in Southern California. And the manufacturing is accomplished in Mexico and it's done through the automotive and through the automotive and the [UNKNOWN] in particular has some of the largest, it's the largest producer of televisions in the world. So it's that synergy that is created that can be expanded on.
7978	Nazarian	Adrin	36	oRmeSyrF0cc	896	918	I just want to say thank you for bringing this measure forward. I completely agree with it, I'd like to make a motion to move the bill forward, in fact at some point I was interested to ask the Doctor to make some comments about the smokeless tobacco issues given the opposition we heard, but at this point I don't think it's even necessary, so I just put us that we move forward with this measure.
7979	Gallagher	James	108	rek1UfAle3c	1550	1562	While unemployment is considered, there is no similar requirement that we allocate those monies to areas with high unemployment. The program, again, the program has already created billions in investment across the state.
7980	Pavley	Fran	104	nrJtkVtsuec	767	791	So what is that potential volatility on setting a specific sum of money over, let's say five years or whatever it is? How can we ensure that can be there without? As the fallback the state on the hook, using general fund to backfill because for whatever reason auction revenue's not there.
7981	Garcia	Eduardo	38	Yh01GevItcE	1076	1088	Alright, well thank you gentlemen for being here and participating on the panel. Very valuable information you've shared with us. I'd like to go to the public comment section of the agenda.
7982	Thurmond	Tony	4	58ODc-fO4Eo	1456	1475	As many of the speakers have noted that this is a key piece, but one piece, of a strategy on poverty reduction and we do think that there were other ideas that are very worthy including lifting the cap on the maximum family grant and that there are other ideas that will continue to be discussed and debated going forward.
7983	Mendoza	Tony	52	vPceAWe-pfQ	1592	1603	And I agree with you. I think this bill is very necessary. We want to make sure that all peace officers, whether reserve or not, they need to be protected against harassment and discrimination.
7984	Moorlach	John	4657	_QWOBYYvqfo	956	969	 Well that didn't help. So Mr. Chair, I'm sure you want a tax credit. You, you made the point a few times, I get that. I can see why everybody would support that.
7985	Hall	Isadore	1	31W9cfaQWLY	156	200	If it were not for the voting rights act, I would not be serving today as a member of the California State Senate. Senators, this resolution may commemorate an event in our nation's history, but as our President said just this past weekend at the foot of the Edmund Pettus Bridge, "the issues raised in Selma, Alabama are not a relic of the past. They are the issues that continued to plague our country to this day."
7986	Pavley	Fran	104	hUewX1j74kY	1252	1270	Department of Finance, you rely solely on the Air Resources Board for information on GHG's and all the legal lens we have to look through on expenditure of auction revenue?
7987	Pavley	Fran	104	oUB8meWTgiM	1061	1082	But I haven't. And so we're having these repeated conversations. Is progress being made? Yes. Is it fast enough? No. Should we have been closing down those 2500 wells until we test them and make sure they're safe? Probably so, an abundance of caution, but now when you open up the paper, you have another 3600 wells.
7988	Hancock	Loni	98	vEySB-JPx9Q	459	475	The other is that you were named as a gang member by someone. Until last year, the only way to get out of solitary confinement, if you were labeled a gang member, was to name other people who were gang members.
7989	Gallagher	James	108	g465sM88Jms	2054	2072	Are private equity owned. So, that's 40, 59% that aren't, right? So, the small mom and pop's, the family owned businesses. That are in the grocery business, they're gonna have to deal with these same requirements, right, when they, when they buy, purchase you know, their competitor's grocery store.
7990	Medina	Jose	81	Hvyw9CxPJq8	582	608	While we are doing that, while we are doing that trying to see how we can incentivize community colleges to raise the ratio of full time to part time, while we're doing that I think it's important that we, at the same time, take a look at and protect and strengthen part time faculty in different aspects.
7991	Calderon	Ian Charles	115	IxMULKwgq0k	978	1006	My concern would be, it seems reasonable to, if the technology existed to have a fingerprint online. But, in the storing of that information and the risk of some company being breached and having that information getting out, and the risk that come with that. Is that something that is being taken into consideration within your opposition to this bill? And has there been any thought as to what that effect would be, and who would hold that information and how would you manage that information?
7992	Jones	Brian	42	F7lT9yIrGAY	1735	1751	So with that said I would encourage the UC and CSU systems which I'm sure they're both very well-qualified and have economic departments that can do studies of their own in parallel to this study come back to us with that
7993	Bonta	Rob	85	YFmVbaB_4iY	216	226	All right, wait a second, we have a business meeting here to conduct. And that means we're not going to have any comments, laughter, other comments from the audience. We're going to let our presenter present and then everyone else is going to have a chance to speak.
7994	Roth	Richard	106	7aIanLUJ17E	1628	1642	The issue is, should we allow driving programs in the State of California that just consist of classroom instruction, or should we require all driving programs both classroom instruction and behind-the-wheel instruction? That's a different issue.
7995	Nielsen	Jim	68	ZKJUzc_ClWA	404	415	And it's a common courtesy around here, as long as there's time, to let an author bring it back. That's common courtesy. Now, if we're not doing that anymore around here that's another matter. I'm okay with that too.
7996	Stone	Mark	20	1l8Sm-QNSvU	941	963	So that as we come back on an annual basis, and look at appropriate revenues that we might apply to an expanding tax credit in this context, that we have the ability to do that. And AB43 is that legislation that gives us the framework within which to have the annual budget discussions about how much we have revenues to afford, how much we want to be able to expand.
7997	De Leon	Kevin	102	kH2FXJE6T-g	681	711	Okay, we've established a quorum. We have two appointments that are before us today that are required to appear, two governors appointments. We're going to take the first appointment, that is Mr. Joe Javier who is being appointed by the governor to be the director of the department of rehabilitation. Let me correct that; not Joe Javier, but Joe Xavier. If I'm correct, right?
7998	Wolk	Lois	94	iZciv2kSkT8	1023	1049	It is, but the issue is exactly what you're talking about, the accountability. I have concerns, the Chair does have concerns as well. We need to work out the accountability mechanisms surrounding those funds. We're not increasing the funds. The funds are in place currently. And that, we're not gonna increase them at all. We want to reorganize to make sure that they are used in a better way.
7999	Hancock	Loni	98	kIQkyQM4CnQ	551	564	So the idea was put forward that we could do a pilot project here with some counties that would be interested in trying that approach and seeing if it would work in California as well.
8000	Stone	Jeff	26	ze-YP1FOzwQ	751	777	They hit the elderly and they fix those on fixed incomes the most. It will be hard to explain this policy to those who rely on helpers and Calsters for their retirement and the pensions as well. For these reasons, Mr. President, I ask members to vote no on SB 185.
8001	Thurmond	Tony	4	2brqaJJ9EWY	726	745	but without the right kinds of resources, and I'm just being honest, I don't see any treatment in this budget from the department, from the Governor, from anyone on enhancing what has been cut, as result of the Recession, I get it. But we know that there is a price to pay
8002	Allen	Benjamin	70	Hl2Rz2-fOZ0	12	23	OK. We're also going to be hearing from Sergio Lara who's the California Deputy Director for Mi Familia Vota. And we'll also be hearing from Fred Nisen who's a Staff Attorney for Disability Rights of California.
8003	Leno	Mark	60	gWhhKfvsU08	909	918	So we make the move of childcare back into 98 as it had originally been. And at the same time, because of the re-benching, the guarantee doesn't suffer, it will actually benefit.
8004	De Leon	Kevin	102	pnu4iUzw8JA	1164	1183	Of all these individuals without a high school diplomas are apprentices who are getting an opportunity for the energy efficiency space that Senator Bob Hertzberg has articulated and very well, by the way, on this issue of the potential economic growth or the largest space for growth in terms of jobs, which is energy efficiency.
8005	Hadley	David	40	gT2_z9UGrSs	1656	1669	Well, Ms. Weber, thank you, and this is a complex issue, I agree. And I pledge to work with the members of this committee and our chamber on this. It is a critically important issue and I would like to work with you on it.
8006	Hernandez	Roger	37	IRk3z3ZISoY	577	585	Thank you Senator, appreciate your testimony, and before we get to your supporting witnesses I'd like to establish quorum, so with that, Madam Secretary, if you would please call roll.
8007	Mendoza	Tony	52	EWFYx7q92DQ	77	91	California based pawnbrokers providing loans must obtain the thumbprint of the person pledging property as collateral for the loan. SB 300 allows California based pawnbrokers to conduct electronic pawnbroker transactions
8008	Leno	Mark	60	b8mZhVlBtpE	989	1018	So this early investment pays significant dividends. And I can strongly support the compromise because of the details in it with regard to this additional investment. Though it's not as we had originally proposed with regard to Prop 98.
8009	Dodd	Bill	71	CD2KiD3xDgY	1044	1061	Lockdowns, a temporary confinement of students and staff to classrooms, offices, and other rooms during or following a disturbance, have proven to be an effective tool used on school campuses to facilitate the safety of both students and staff during a violent situation.
8010	Beall	Jim	92	hb1VvxrKGQE	912	920	And AB1338 by assemblymember Gomez. Those are the consent calendar items. There is a motion to approve the consent calendar, any questions on these? We have a motion. We have a motion. Call the roll, please?
8011	Bonta	Rob	85	mNyHP9HDpqk	594	611	So, I'll, I'll say those are my concerns. They're, they're, they're significant but not unresolvable. And so, I think we can solve those problems. I just don't think we can solve them today in this committee and my suggestion with respect is that you consider making this a two-year bill, Assembly Member Cooley.
8012	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	yhx1NvxzAgA	871	900	The statute of limitations that we have offered, or that I have offered, extends that statute of limitations to ten years. There are very few crimes where we allow a stature of limitations that long. Not because we don't wanna get the bad guys, but we recognize that people's memories, their ability to remember an incident, to identify the location, to bring justice to be heard, can be affected by that delay in time.
8013	Mendoza	Tony	52	EWFYx7q92DQ	91	102	by replacing the thumbprint requirement with a new requirement that loans may be transferred to the bank account of the consumer requesting the loan. With that, Mr. Chairman, would welcome any questions.
8014	Weber	Shirley	44	7i9bh_kaYv0	185	196	So we respectfully ask for your support of this bill. This bill is supported by a number of individuals. It is a bipartisan bill coming out of our house, getting the support not only of both parties that are there.
8015	Leno	Mark	60	EP8eVPLyUZg	349	369	He's not longer Dr. Heinbach. He has had his medical license revoked because of the misinformation he spread on behalf of citizens for fire safety, which no longer exists because the Chicago Tribune exposed them. They have been discredited, disgraced and dishonored. They're not here anymore. I would ask for your aye vote.
8016	Pan	Richard	96	gB_BkuvgLvc	705	736	There is no limitation on a physician from doing that, other than their own professional judgment, their own knowledge and expertise about what they believe is safe for the patient. I think that when we craft our laws, it's best that we try not to direct, unless we have strong scientific evidence. And the direct position that they now must do something that they have the ability to already do.
8017	Stone	Jeff	26	k_l5daYZc00	1137	1156	And I'm concerned about the Coachella Valley, where I have a number of small districts that have largely Hispanic English as a second language curriculum. And I believe that it's not by coincidence that these are the areas of my district that have the highest unemployment.
8018	Hueso	Ben	48	EE5x4AZj6R4	478	498	You know the costs of processing this application are not well-reflected in the $75 fee that currently exists. This legislation is needed to adjust the fee. This bill will be a simple change to the statute to better reflect the current reasonable cost of processing
8019	Hueso	Ben	48	CVYbaFO-ROE	1235	1264	Unfortunately, I won't be supporting this bill today. I know there's been a glut of bills that everybody's asked about on in a subject that is extremely technical in nuance. It is something that we should understand very clearly before we make a decision that's gonna affect other businesses, other employees out there, other operators that will be effected negatively by this because they're caught in a different system often times without their own control.
8020	Thurmond	Tony	4	b2XLo4I9yzU	1824	1839	Were gonna lift the call for the absent members to add on. Madame Clerk, if you would, these are for the department of managed health care issues one and two. And Madame Clerk, if you would state state the items and then we'll call the roll.
8021	Mullin	Kevin	31	r1PhXBRe6ug	942	968	All members vote who desire to vote. This is to add on as co-authors on ACR5. All members vote who desire to vote. This is for co-authors, members. The clerk will close the roll. We have 75 co-authors added on the measure.
8022	Patterson	Jim	119	nZglKWPAZEc	438	458	I am concerned about California being so far out on the edge. We say we are going to set the standards for the rest of the world, I guess. And yet no other state is doing this. No other state is pricing carbon, that I'm aware of.
8023	Achadjian	K.H. "Katcho"	5	Y0xkoNoudD0	299	315	Thank you Madame speaker. It gives me great pleasure in asking you to join me in welcoming California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo with us this morning is the President of Cal Poly, Dr. Jeff Armstrong, and the dean of Cal Poly College of Science and Mathematics Phil Bailey.
8024	Wieckowski	Bob	55	FoClVNhVQAg	153	187	You don't think that the Legislature at some time, I mean, these lawsuits don't happen overnight. These conflicts, I mean, North Carolina had the Legislature had five, six, eight years to step in. That you don't think when we have our normal review, that we'd say this is a beige area. And it's not crystal clear, but we feel as we ask some judges to make comfort orders, we say well, we'd like to have the Legislature to weight in specifically on this to say, that's what we had in mind when we passed that Consumer Protection Act.
8025	Cannella	Anthony	61	fdbxd6pnPrg	951	968	How are we doing? I think the goal of prison is to rehabilitate ultimately. There's some folks that need to stay in there forever but a lot of them we want to rehabilitate and get them out and be productive, how are we doing, and this isn't really your jurisdiction, but you see these kids all the time. How are we doing with rehabilitating the kids?
8026	Hertzberg	Robert	99	wHx-nZg7Thw	655	679	So the argument is, well it already exists, that we already have that. Well, guess what? Alabama is kicking our butt. They've got a program. Illinois has a program. Massachusetts has a program. It's unbelievable what great marketing people have come up with in order to come up with these point systems, and how much the system's changed in the rewards program.
8027	Wood	Jim	72	k0jwR3_bc5U	941	963	The county has control over how many plants they authorize, so you could establish a program in a county with zero tags. I would say that is the ultimate in local control. You could have as many plants as you want as well. If you default to the state, if a county defaulted to the state and decide they did not want to do any part of this program, then there would be a default of 99 plants.
8028	Stone	Mark	20	X4Bkp9BrIdE	1019	1043	and okay, I'm still not sure how we then get to the open data. If your bill was saying, we need to understand what your data sets are, what sort of technology it is, in order to be able to draw out what data you're collecting, what format it's in, what's available, and then I think also, of course, that data that is public and
8029	Gaines	Ted	24	iJc5cTYtc4Q	1448	1471	Right, and so we obviously, are off-tilt and need to focus on a solution. That ought to be a bi-partisan effort that should not require a lot of wrangling. It seems to me that these are things that can be resolved. That ought to be a priority of our constituents whether you're a Democrat or a Republic.
8030	Chavez	Rocky	83	37JGlYuk31E	127	141	Well I'll just go to the amendments. I appreciate that the doctor took the amendments, I think it does make it a better bill. But I go back to the issue of what I think is extremely important, that's the public process.
8031	Pavley	Fran	104	-_4-MnSxShM	550	566	His primary purpose of the bill is to reaffirm the state's sole regulatory authority over taking possession of fish and game By prohibiting cities and counties from passing ordinances that strictly relate to taking or possession of fish and game.
8032	Stone	Jeff	26	oaFR61I7UCg	731	749	Thank you for your testimony. We'll bring the two opponents up, please. Oh, okay. Before that? Okay, forgive me. We're gonna hear those that are in support of the bill, if you'll come forward, please, and just let us know if you support the bill and who you are? For the record. Thank you.
8033	Frazier	Jim	114	7UjH6y-2-HM	305	328	But limit the scope to dyslexia, not other specific learning disabilities or related disorders, and require the completion of the guidelines' specific date. With me today, I have testifying in support, Dr. Kelli Sandman-Hurley co-founder of the Dyslexia Training Institute and Holly Snyder, a teacher, and a parent of a child with dyslexia.
8034	De Leon	Kevin	102	SxRX-lKXiDU	1036	1057	Policy wise, I just add. This is some subjective commentary. I think it's absolutely critical that this universe, wherever they may be, at the lower economic strata, have access because the reality is because of a lack of financial wherewithal they tend to drive cars that are,
8035	McGuire	Mike	93	GnxGwd8ZNfU	1113	1126	Thank you very much Mr. Vice Chair. I would like to be able to turn over to Ms. Senator Hancock or Mr. Senator Stone if they have any opening comments.
8036	Garcia	Eduardo	38	rw_EhgHmCSQ	1104	1119	I represent the Fifty-Sixth Assembly District and that's eastern Riverside County and Imperial County, known to shake things up a bit for two reasons: one, the San Andreas Fault, and the Coachella Valley Music Art Festival. And both knock you off your feet.
8037	Grove	Shannon	77	wK5CwGDTeOM	830	845	Please, please vote aye on this bill. There are people that are living like they have been living in a third-world country that desperately need to be able to make sure that they can have clean, good drinking water and baby water and washing water into their homes. Thank you.
8038	McGuire	Mike	93	J0kwSkFFMEE	844	856	Thank you so much, Mr. Chair. I do appreciate the opportunity to be here at the hearing, I wanted to say how grateful I am. Thank you so much, sir, as well as to the Committee. Mr. Chair, I just have some comments and just a couple quick questions, if that's okay?
8039	Santiago	Miguel	17	v8Lqd5JpuF0	203	221	Sure. This particular bill is consistent with the last one in a sea of Los Angeles plans to develop that particular area. So i do believe it is consistent to the bill house provisions, that if any Federal dollars were, were to be at stake within 60 days this, this sign would be removed.
8040	Atkins	Toni	110	23L8yaBtAnI	1836	1846	counsel, our sergeants, and our special services, without whom we wouldn't have tackled all these bills and had the information we needed before us every day as we got started
8041	Gordon	Richard	117	a4X1msw4NL8	630	648	Important protections included AB339 are a cap on prescription drug co-pays and co-insurance of no more than $250 for most coverage and $500 for bronze under the Covered California. Also consistent with federal guidance, bill requires that most or all drugs to treat a specific condition not be placed on the highest cost tier, in order to avoid a discriminatory impact.
8042	Chiu	David	7	wEqNM_ksYTE	949	961	It does not provide a preference for one kind of clinic over another. It doesn't prevent any center from providing current ongoing services, and it doesn't discriminate on the basis of religion.
8043	Stone	Jeff	26	-yLqvo8WX6M	656	674	Well, I just want you to answer the question, though. Do you feel that the GPS tools would better identify habitats that you're trying to protect? In my view, just arbitrarily applying to the roads may not give you the protections that you're seeking here today.
8044	Pavley	Fran	104	GUxOzh3Wh0Q	1996	2018	If we're using greenhouse gas emission monies, which I'm, I'll just say skeptical of how the net value will pencil out. But, with the Energy Commission or CARB or whomever it is, sort of Gatekeeping that I think the potential for eligibility is there, so I'll be supporting this today.
8045	Bonilla	Susan	3	D1U0Ojzunqk	1601	1622	Don't ever need to go because they've found the secret up there but. So maybe there's a side benefit that we will all discover. But I think that, overall, we're certainly doing something that's very necessary.
8046	Gatto	Mike	46	M5Sfl5zR2ew	637	653	So, there are no researchers who go and get your child's blood. You store your child's cord blood in case your own child needs it for later. There is no computerized reduction of your child's blood. There is no computerized reduction of your child's genome to researchers with your child's cord blood program. It's apples and oranges.
8047	Maienschein	Brian	84	X4Bkp9BrIdE	1308	1336	to the citizens that we all are representing here, is somehow a cyber security risk. I mean, that's just, I find that argument a little bit disingenuous. We should know what our government's doing. We should know, we should be able to, especially all of us sitting here on this panel and in this body, who are attempting to provide solutions.
8048	Santiago	Miguel	17	tEhMYBdIqkE	1926	1944	And, granted, there's arguments about constitutional rights, but some laws are unjust and they're made to change. We're law makers, we change laws when we seen the need to change laws. At one point in time, the law of this country allowed slavery, that got changed. And at this point in the country we face an epic crisis on this,
8049	Liu	Carol	63	HutoDdelxCc	1162	1206	Thank you. Okay, any others in support? Is there anyone opposed the bill? Seeing none. Okay Senator Fuller I just had a couple questions here. I do see, unlike Senator Block, it is more than a no-brainer for me because it does set a precedent or maybe it doesn't, you know, because you've identified another definition. Six of these schools have applied and received modernization funds that are still on the list. I guess I didn't, because the formula doesn't allow them to modernize to the extent that they needed to be modernize over the last maybe ten years and there's a twenty five-year wait etc. So I understand the conundrum here.
8050	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	rEreViIPqP0	858	882	Welcome to Mr. Bacon's class. Welcome to the State Senate. Nice to have some future Senators here. All right. Anyone else under privileges of the floor? Any other privileges so the floor? Senator Allen, for what purpose sir?
8051	Bonta	Rob	85	iF8zLPAheNg	585	604	It's been a collaborative approach of many Assembly members working on both sides of the aisle to come together that to put forward an opportunity to have a comprehensive regulatory regime in the State of California for the first-time in 20 years, so I want to thank Doctor Wood for his very thoughtful and unique contributions to this regulatory regime.
8052	Wagner	Donald	88	bzJzCS8XdVc	1920	1949	Folks in those circumstances absolutely deserve citizenship, unfortunately posthumous, okay, that's not this bill. This isn't even a bill, it's a resolution. Which brings me to the second point. Yes, it's true, many on my side of the aisle have voted for some of the bills that have come before us dealing with our undocumented community, and there's been some division within the GOP on those issues.
8053	Wolk	Lois	94	r722a4Ml8Ec	840	852	Thank Mr. Chair, I will be brief. I want to return to the issue that Senator Hancock mentioned, and very briefly. There are two very important reasons that we should consider it and I appreciate the fact that you said it will be going to conference.
8054	Moorlach	John	4657	0RRItBGCgNM	1862	1887	Thank you, Mr. Chair. I just see this bill as a giant grab bag. I'm having a tough time even coming close to remotely connecting this to our budget. And there are some many items in here that we can talk about an hour on each of them. I'm having real trouble with how this even relates to what we're doing with the budget, so I'll be opposed.
8055	Gomez	Jimmy	80	E5Lv9C_D3vg	1017	1039	Provider directories for healthcare plans and insurers. Specified detailed procedures, health plans, and insurers must follow to maintain an accurate provider directories and requires both the Department of Managed Health Care and the Department of Insurance to develop uniform provider directories for plans and insurers, respectfully, that are regulated by each department.
8056	Wolk	Lois	94	RToDyZa8pHM	1133	1144	Specified information that really enables us to understand whether it's been a value, whether it's done a good job, whether it's been fair-- fair and effective and useful in project delivery.
8057	Liu	Carol	63	DDRuG0CC7zE	689	702	Thank you very much. Good afternoon members and happy New Year. This is a great occasion and I'm pleased to introduce Geoff Baum nominee for re-appointment as a member of the Community College Board of Governors.
8058	Gomez	Jimmy	80	xdWYyoTV6kU	589	606	Marcelino immigrated to California and then immigrated to California in 1974. After immigrating he works for the San Francisco Recreation and Parks Department and retired after 10 years of civil service. Upon retiring, he moved to Sacramento to pursue his other interests.
8059	Dahle	Brian	47	E2p7xKQCT9g	494	510	And we're trying to prove, also, that we would qualify for greenhouse gas funds. So has that all been taken into account for the process that you're talking about? So that we can actually verify that you are reducing carbon by this process.
8060	Mendoza	Tony	52	Ve6b2OIjftM	589	602	Even though the statute is written with voters in mind, the provisions are still worded in complicated legislative language and inadvertently presents unnecessary challenges to voters who are trying to understand the law as it affects them.
8061	Mitchell	Holly	64	tOhAw6uVpYA	886	897	And so the MAGI continues to be a challenge that I'm hearing at least from advocates that they're hoping that the department will continue to work with them to work through some of the MAGI hallenges.
8062	Leyva	Connie	62	h8juzK-Kjc4	947	963	When I was doing research on this issue, I wanted to have some facts for you. I know it's important, but facts are important as well the Washington post had a study that was done kind of a little spoof on how many hours you would have to work.
8063	Stone	Jeff	26	tOhAw6uVpYA	900	910	Madame Chair, I regret that I've gotta leave to catch a plane. And so if I could just a couple comments on a couple of issues that are very important to me. Before I leave. Thank you for that opportunity.
8064	Weber	Shirley	44	nmXPXxV6MnM	1297	1319	I think this will send a message to the, it should send a message to University of California that the Legislature wants more information, wants more information concerning the funding and it may be very true , and I think it probably is at most the new high salaries we see in the medical schools that you find at the University of California that you don't find at the CSU issues in terms of the attraction this year.
8065	Wood	Jim	72	JVAurJ3HeDI	969	993	The industry Emerald Growers Association, among others, believe that the number is actually very low and that the market in California could be as high as $32 billion. There are very few environmental regulations for medical cannabis cultivators, an estimated 60 to 70% of all marijuana consumed in the United States comes from three counties in my Assembly District, commonly referred to as the Emerald Triangle.
8066	De Leon	Kevin	102	A5ksLI96f9Q	1008	1025	Colleagues, we're going to move on with the agenda. However, we are going to make a small edit right now. We're gonna go to Mr. Eric Banks. So we're going to do  a little dancing around the agenda. We're gonna go to Mr. Banks right now, who's filed item number, letter C. Mr. Banks, welcome.
8067	Mullin	Kevin	31	meEH-43hxZQ	1795	1811	Sorry. Okay. So, this, the budget item. Can I ask a question, Mr. Chair, before we move the item? What is the timeline on posting those appropriation requests online if we get you the-
8068	Bates	Pat	58	9eA3HqZp1ws	1720	1738	Some of his many contributions to ensure Oceanside was a great city were serving on the Dconomic Development Committee, El Corazon Oversight Committee, Police and Fire Commission, Canine Companions for Independence, Rotary President, and twice the Chairman of the Oceanside Chamber of Commerce.
8069	Lara	Ricardo	107	qTf-RqJKEFo	462	474	Absolutely the intent here is to not leave anybody out who is doing the good work that we need so we're going to definitely work with your staff and our city folks to ensure that we address this issue by the next committee.
8070	Bonta	Rob	85	SQe4IQVjZKc	19	35	And there's another opportunity to make some amendments and move some priorities around. This is a top priority I hope you'll understand of the Legislature from the hearings that you've been in from what you've heard shared with you again bicameral, bipartisan.
8071	Mendoza	Tony	52	nlURi31-KJY	566	583	with a resolution commemorating today January 26 as India Republic day I'm also pleased to announce that for the first-time in the history of our California State Legislature a concurrent resolution that the Senate and the
8072	Thurmond	Tony	4	z9oG0bZdBOg	5	27	Let this meeting come to order. Good afternoon, thank you for joining us. I can think of no more important work than what we can do to help our families get out of poverty. I say that as somebody who was born in this state and came from an immigrant family that was on public assistance.
8073	Garcia	Cristina	112	ohOGzwAGjR4	764	779	More a comment, I'll be really brief, I appreciate what the author's doing today, and I think it's definitely in the right direction. I just wanna make sure it's moved forward with this target of 50%, and we are thinking about flexibility for the ISO.
8074	McGuire	Mike	93	eQ53gxbhFGs	1499	1518	SMART can reduce its cost as a public transit agency, and focus on its mission: transporting 1 million folks per year. That said, with the one Chief, SMART can give the right to know on information they need to know along their line, providing for a safer and more responsive agency to the riders of the North Bay area.
8075	Huff	Bob	105	EkjCB3EukYI	898	922	to banning public places. And, you know, while that discussion should be had and we should continue to reflect on particularly new technologies, nicotine is not in e-cigarettes, not seen as tobacco products, this bill would bring it in as well as some of the protections against that. Are we really telling landlords they can't regulate what goes on within their
8076	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	_wQgbHlbFh8	1021	1045	Sure. This is a bill that says that I have a right up to 350 feet of my home to be safe from any invasion of my privacy, any trespass of my property, any potential possibility that a drone will be flying within that level that could actually fall out of the sky.
8077	Nielsen	Jim	68	yLYXPq0fwvY	1056	1073	And have you heard of small practice, single person bought a practice from another single person that we did business with for 30 years, struggling. Giving up on Medi-Cal entirely. But she's very fearful of this model, if you will.
8078	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	I1DeZTgw_DI	1530	1538	And we, unfortunately, have to require what that is. If left to its own device as a free market, we'd still have slavery, child labor laws, and no minimum wage.
8079	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	R2eb9EMkWP0	608	630	So I guess what has me puzzled is you're working off a program that's been in place for three years. It's been very successful as I understand it. You wanna expand it to make it a mandatory program for certain jurisdictional limits at. What is the problem?
8080	Wood	Jim	72	v8Lqd5JpuF0	1724	1736	In my mind as we expand the ACA, 40% under served is probably MediCal. I would really like to see language that, that reflected that and how do we, how do we then enforce what we do by underskirt because this
8081	Williams	Das	12	Jp9_8mUBXj4	1960	1977	I just add, management practices. If we're protecting those lands, also management practices factors in as well. We have great research coming out indicating that use of compost on range land fixes carbon in deep soil.
8082	Gomez	Jimmy	80	QXW5aikdMmE	1685	1699	AB 544, Mullin, Expansion of the Research and Development Tax Credit Holding committee. AB 603, Salas, tax credits for participation and lawn removal in sentence holding committee. AB 681, Ting, reforms to county assessor programs due pass. A roll call.
8083	Stone	Jeff	26	perI44B8dbA	1672	1698	The reason why they use this tax exempt financing is to lower their cost so they can build hospitals which are very expensive today to deliver. We had one in Tomeca, it was just built, we're talking well over $1 million of that. So if we're gonna be able to care for the 30 million Californians in the state of California, we should be doing things that provide the process to result in quality work, but at the same, time keep the cost down. This is going to make health care a lot more expensive and for those reasons I can't support the bill. Thank you.
8084	Hertzberg	Robert	99	Wt_ez7F9UlE	715	733	Thank you, thanks so much, because it seems to me that what really is happening here is that the other party in the other side of the case will be the entity that will then push it, right?
8085	Block	Marty	59	KyjcaFzffNo	1253	1275	SB 758 requires the Department of Water Resources to research the causes and effects of atmospheric rivers and to take all actions within its existing authority to capture water generated by atmospheric rivers in order to increase the supply and reliability of water resources in the state and to operate reservoirs in a manner that improves flood protection
8086	Block	Marty	59	pmfMdqMvBTk	225	245	The staff recommendations appear on each page next to each item. The committee has had a chance to review these, so the motion will be to adopt the staff recommendations for basically items 1 to 43 and items 45 to 47.
8087	Hueso	Ben	48	6K6tNBJxn7k	226	240	And would there be a way in the future because, you know, we regulate the insurance company here in California in a way that requires a commissioner and requires an independent agency
8088	Pavley	Fran	104	RM5OAEIHO1U	1403	1417	 He's got it, it's the permanence may outlive this program, so. And one other question for the Energy Commission and then I'll be quiet. You were here for the Energy Commission?
8089	Bloom	Richard	2	YfyxpSh_BfE	350	374	Thank you. I'd just like to add some comments based on conversations that we've had with Santa Monica College which is one of the successful applicants and is gearing up its BA program. I don't think that they anticipated the popularity of these programs or their program anyway, where there's a waiting list already to get in.
8090	Baker	Catharine	74	dKlfu24NXRk	708	727	And secondly, my understanding is, it has not been implemented yet, but it will be in one of the next major election cycles is same-day voting which will-- excuse me, include registration which would make this, I think this bill unnecessary and the automatic process and any administrative costs and issues so that you know,
8091	Beall	Jim	92	VpwREaswL_E	336	373	Just two comments on the waiver. It's my hope that the waiver includes full enforcement of federal and state Mental Health and Substances Parity Act so we have full implementation. We've had just too many failures in California that are very costly with fines and so forth relative to enforcement of the mental health laws in the United States and in the State of California, so I hope that the waiver includes that.
8092	McGuire	Mike	93	_I82MBaJ6Dg	249	284	Just, I think, one comment and some questions. I think where the concern lies is being able to provide those tools to allow individuals to thrive once they hit that hard deadline. I will speak for myself with where the concern is that the assessment that was promised to be standardized - only 1,300 families have been able to participate within that standardized assessment, where we are at right now.
8093	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	_Xf-JuWDBj0	828	837	So given that we have a fairly large contingent of women in the legislature and a few good men, or maybe many good men. We may find that out.
8094	Mayes	Chad	79	H9sj-95HbgQ	1208	1223	In fact, I'm one that says I think poverty is probably our largest issue and over the long-term. We've got some temporary issues, but I think poverty is one of those that seems to be systematic, and it's something that I'm very, very concerned about.
8095	McGuire	Mike	93	nqU0Ufhmqoo	1631	1652	Support for rigorous performance based CTE programs cuts across party lines and I want to thank Senator Leyva for being a joint author, very grateful. Would like to thank minority leader Huff for being a principal coauthor, Senator Mendoza and Senator Vidak for being co authors, along with many other Senators and the assembly Members.
8096	Frazier	Jim	114	3Luw7tOrBzg	306	322	Your agency, who's the funding mechanism for your agency, and what kind of employees, like we asked Sea Save, what kind of employee base do you have on? And is your employee base big enough to carry the work load?
8097	Ting	Philip	30	GYqLytCM9KA	238	254	Thank you, Mr. Speaker. AB1321 expands California's opportunity to get access to over $100 million of potentially federal funding to really allow low income communities to get access to fresh fruits and vegetables by using really farm bill money that was already appropriated by the federal government.
8098	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	IRk3z3ZISoY	213	240	Now the state provisions which are based on the Federal Equal Pay Act, are rarely utilized because many loopholes make it nearly impossible to establish a successful claim. Pay secrecy also contributes to the gender gap because women cannot challenge discrimination if they don't know they're being paid less that their male counterparts. If you don't know you can't complain.
8099	Brown	Cheryl	13	m4SYy4oYAnU	1739	1756	How do we keep the supplanting  going forward from GO-Biz. How do you look at that because if someone is saying well, we can go higher, get rid of these and go higher, the same number from another country. What does that do to our employment?
8100	Garcia	Eduardo	38	h4u4YccC9Z8	812	827	This bill supplements those efforts and will help improve the health and safety for the disadvantaged communities along the border region of California. I respectfully ask for your aye vote. With me is Luis Olmedo, with the Comite Civico, who also worked on this issue.
8101	Weber	Shirley	44	9UYl1IR1e0U	248	266	They had been suspended or expelled in some informal method very quickly. And we found them back at the school door, in the inner city schools that had been sent back, but the money didn't follow them. The money didn't come back and so the schools they kept these young people for 30 to 60 days, whatever the census data period was.
8102	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	SQUPcyDaRgg	922	934	You can see this is really fascinating stuff, but it is all extremely important, particularly to those agencies that are involved, to those industries that are involved and to the public health and safety.
8103	Pan	Richard	96	YovLyNfdmT8	1313	1341	And then also I guess it goes back to the question I did ask the Director too, is when you drive out all the mid-size plans, are the feds gonna come back and say, cuz the only people left in the mid-sized plans are essentially Medi-Cal plans. And they come back and say, it's no longer a broad based tax because essentially the only people left in the middle are Medi-Cal plans and they're gonna say, well, we gotta redo your thing again. And I'm gonna go back saying, well, you need to do a flat tier or something like that.
8104	Leno	Mark	60	6KgzpeS3bCM	597	607	they are literally in the dark, so the more information helps them improve the health of their workers, as well as, for them systemically to be able to contain their costs.
8105	Levine	Marc	8	AJJV4Jngl_c	80	92	The point of the article was that increasingly our challenges must be solved in an integrated way and that we simply cannot afford to work in silos any longer. The future of the very planet may depend upon it.
8106	Perea	Henry	33	ch3qK2_FbyA	772	792	Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I'm happy to rise today in support of AB 1288. As many of you know, my goal over the last few years has been to ensure equitable distribution of cap and trade revenues to disadvantaged areas of California that are left often times to bear the burden of many of these policies.
8107	Beall	Jim	92	2tOIPOStcDA	39	72	Yeah, SB12, I'd like to present SB12 first. Thank you Mr. Chairman and members it's my pleasure to  present to the appropriations committee SB12. In 2010 I authored AB12, which extended foster youth benefits from 18 to 21. Youth who are forced to leave the foster care system at age 18 face significant challenges such as high rates of homelessness, incarceration and low graduation rates.
8108	Chiu	David	7	sR3YZBZSyxQ	1569	1590	Seeing and hearing no further debate, the clerk will open the roll. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. Clerk will close the roll. Tally the votes, ayes 41, nos 29. The Senate amendments are concurred in.
8109	Frazier	Jim	114	3Luw7tOrBzg	492	510	For example, I have seen charts of U.S. Department of Education that show that when you combine VA and ED funds, Argosy, a university which you accredit, gets more than 85% of its revenue from those two sources alone, not including Cal Grants.
8110	Lackey	Tom	10	2HmztWZsIt4	350	367	Yes Miss Eggman, I really do appreciate your intervention here. I just wanted to really briefly mention that my experiences have been very, very powerful, and I have to say that dangerous behavior is not always criminal behavior.
8111	Irwin	Jacqui	16	EgZgFkyj3MQ	2164	2189	Mr. speaker and members, I rise today on behalf of myself and Assembly Member Dos Williams to adjourn in the memory of Michele Serros, an acclaimed author, poet, and social commentator who passed away January 4th after a two-year battle with cancer. Michelle grew up in the El Rio community of Oxnard, as part of a working-class Mexican-American family.
8112	Hertzberg	Robert	99	iJc5cTYtc4Q	1580	1592	So, I would only suggest you go back, in addition to the idea of revenue bonds, but maybe we could do something like that. So, it is what it is. But it certainly has some merit. Look at anything that relates.
8113	Obernolte	Jay	86	HsL2PuGY_BI	1515	1531	and I'm concerned that we're expanding this authority to the Department of Fish and Wildlife unnecessarily. I'm wondering why you couldn't just, if you noticed an unauthorized diversion, take that complaint to the Water Resources Control Board and have them administer the complaint as they do currently?
8114	Alejo	Luis	9	R2eb9EMkWP0	985	1002	Last bill. I'm here to present AB 1390, a bipartisan bill that will bring new efficiency to the process of adjudicating water rights in ground water basins. Before I begin, I'd like to agree to the amendments in concept as outlined in analysis. And I look forward to working with you and this committee
8115	Pavley	Fran	104	0J9n2c3eCds	3	26	And, we're going to start with the subcommittee if that's all right with the author that's present today and we won't take roll yet obviously or drop the rules but a few announcements: first of all any members of that are lingering in their offices, come on down. Ready to start. Three items are on the consent calendar. Items five, six and
8116	Rendon	Anthony	120	ROiUoxqGjEc	1280	1295	Two years ago, the US Supreme Court handed down, handed down a decision on the responsibility for storm water in the LA River. Last year, the US Army Corps of Engineers approved several important projects to restore the upper, upper LA River known as alternative 20.
8117	Hertzberg	Robert	99	g1KhSxf2FKA	327	338	Quickly, Senator Nguyen, and then Senator Bill. Lets just let the Senators ask the question, and then close. Oh, and let me make sure I ask support and position. I haven't even gotten that far, we jumped into it. No problem.
8118	Mitchell	Holly	64	BQqDpHFSu0U	1622	1629	Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Any comments, wrap up comments you'd like to make based on public testimony? Thank you very much, appreciate it. The discussions will continue, we're gonna hold these two items open.
8119	Mitchell	Holly	64	BQqDpHFSu0U	1629	1657	Next, we'll move on to item number 8 under Department of Public Health, page 46 on the agenda, which is Genetic Disease Screen Program update in AB 1559 of the 2014 statute. Good afternoon.
8120	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	UNL7QUa36z0	1286	1301	It's been a battle every step of the way to get the oil industry to comply with, or to acknowledge the need, for any kind of regulation. California is not the wild west when it comes to oil drilling and certainly not along our coast.
8121	Bloom	Richard	2	79bMZ-eNloc	1036	1059	I'm not so concerned about most jurisdictions, I'm concerned about that lesser number, which would probably be very few, but for a very few individuals the result could be devastating and I'm not given much solace that individuals who might be subject to this have the ability to go to court to redress their grievance here.
8122	Mitchell	Holly	64	KTS25NPAjyE	1929	1938	I was hoping Dr. Pan had the answer for me, and he didn't. And I was just curious, the other 20 states that you said that have already passed this. How was this issue handled in those 20 states?
8123	Pan	Richard	96	w3MaeL9rUCE	1351	1360	And there was a company called deck, you probably don't know that either, right?  But, the thing is I mean that's how fast it's moving and these things haven't been around that long, right?
8124	Patterson	Jim	119	QFffajW9pIQ	1256	1277	The suggestion that you're getting two bites of the apple with ALJ and then you get a second go around with the full board, I think there will be a number of people who have had an experience through this process where they may very well suggest that that's not in reality two bites, it's really one.
8125	Stone	Mark	20	jIa2_lUgVm8	0	23	So I'll bring it now back to the Committee for questions of the panel. And a lot of questions were raised by the presentations and I very much appreciate you coming in and I know looking through the Hosanna-Tabor case, the court was only willing to go so far with it.
8126	Olsen	Kristin	15	G4RiUnTMom4	1048	1064	And our students deserve the opportunity to learn from effective teachers. A recent study earlier this year, by Teach Plus, of California teachers discovered that between 65 and 72% of our teachers support education reforms.
8127	Pavley	Fran	104	FapiTOGMI3c	2044	2073	At the end of the day we have a lot of risks. That's what keeps me in the game. And so when a respected organization like the California Council on Science and Technology lists some of these concerns on not really looking for contamination on produced water and percolation ponds, these are unaligned, and how it may percolate in to the ground water bases through pathways, we need to do that.
8128	Thurmond	Tony	4	_YWoRdtfoP8	594	605	because it's new and there will be bumps in the road, as there are with any new implementation, will there be room to accept the feedback from teachers and administrators and other students
8129	Achadjian	K.H. "Katcho"	5	nkFf3IHgULc	2032	2046	It was in Mr. Padilla's bill and is being ignored because we have dealers who have received those threatening letters while the law exists and if I may, as of four hours ago, we met and were willing to continue our discussions.
8130	De Leon	Kevin	102	85T-CDj8RB4	1130	1152	I thank you for your wonderful staff work as well as your leadership on this issue and many other issues as it relates to climate change. Looking forward to not just continuing the good work with my democratic colleagues but also too with my republican colleagues as well too. I wanna have an open door. Mr. Patterson. First time we've ever spoken before. You're more than welcome to come to my office any time you like.
8131	Hueso	Ben	48	Ydll29eHOng	1193	1210	One of the first thing she did as a very young person was to provide assistance to farm workers who were working very hard but also very poor. She provided them with meals and water to a system.
8132	Chavez	Rocky	83	B6r57uGOz9Y	737	763	I, agree with the Chair looking at that, the money I will stand my issue of the block rent issue, but if you are going forward, assuming AB-13 is going to get through appropriations, which allow veterans and the community colleges to use the GI bill.
8133	Harper	Matthew	14	zdfniIDuOwc	25	47	Is it a local decision? An institutional decision? Is it a decision for congress? Or is it a decision for us here at the State Legislature? So, given that we have voluntary and discretionary programs at each of these universities, why take away that decision from the local colleges and universities, whether they be public or private?
8134	Chavez	Rocky	83	B6r57uGOz9Y	763	775	If it doesn't get through they'll be 65,000 veterans in your community college that'll lose all their funding. I don't think we'll go there, but I'm a little concerned. But assuming that we do pass that bill, allowed to go forward, have you thought about any funding for veterans? Specifically for them?
8135	Wood	Jim	72	UqQcd0TyhPE	1187	1198	Thank you very much, Chair and members, AB 320. California leads the world in environmental policies and has implemented some of the most comprehensive environmental regulations in the world.
8136	Waldron	Marie	29	toyLEHK5bMU	1023	1041	My city took $10 million out of its general fund to fund infrastructure improvements in the downtown urban core which is a city that's been around since the 1880's. We needed that infrastructure development. That happened before I even got on the City Council.
8137	Leno	Mark	60	YrZrpwtmLSQ	546	566	Have it verified by homeless service providers, and once that is done they would be exempt from the fees for the high school equivalency or proficiency exams, traditionally known as GED though that's just a brand name, it's one of a number of different examinations that are available.
8138	Bates	Pat	58	_Bb4hK8XVqo	13	39	Thank you, Senator Beall. Actually, members, I'm here with just a presentation today. I won't be asking for a vote.I think it's a great segue from your comment a few minutes ago, Senator Beall, when you said we can't reconstruct this whole thing and reform it in three days and I think that's the problem with the approach on STIP funding. As you know it's very complex, very many, many levels in it.
8139	Liu	Carol	63	VyoFcVtTJtQ	594	601	And so it is, for me, you know, a work in progress. This bill is going to the floor, it does not go to another committee. It's not appropriation.
8140	Allen	Benjamin	70	vE1aI3Q_hng	612	631	Our public health officials tell us, unequivocally, the answer is yes. That's up to us to decide. I certainly have listened carefully to the science and I feel as though there's a compelling state interest, but that's a determination for each and every one of us in the legislature to make. Whether the case has been made that there is a compelling state interest to take this sort of action.
8141	Lara	Ricardo	107	-Ah0Dbgfor4	1247	1258	SB 123, school-based Medi-Cal administrative activities report do pass recommendation. We will substitute the roll from SB 254. That was approved on a unanimous vote of seven to zero.
8142	Nielsen	Jim	68	YLKuY8cYE0M	1788	1812	I said where did the money come from? He said, well we didn't fill those deputy commissioner positions, salary savings. And I said, well Glen we're not gonna do that anymore. And I must tell you, I had a hard fight. I would say I didn't get it stopped, but we did less. This is kind of a step back. That was a good reform way back when.
8143	Hancock	Loni	98	g_HgBg8yC5k	99	118	The problem is that it's often not an effective alternative for people with developmental disability because it relies on a written test to kind of prequalify people, and then their name is sent out on a list to departments that might be interested.
8144	Patterson	Jim	119	9NVb2cnRnt4	1814	1826	So we've taken it from the truck weight, put it in the general fund, taken at and instead of giving it back we're basically going to tax the rest of the people of the state of California to make good on that.
8145	Pavley	Fran	104	_NTagRCFfsc	1836	1858	But in any dwelling unit regardless of whether it's affordable or not. Expenditure of renounced gas emissions in conjunction with prioritizing some of these seismic retrofits. because if you're messing with the structural integrity. Building, let's do the windows, let's do the.
8146	Patterson	Jim	119	9NVb2cnRnt4	1788	1814	With respect to the packaging this coming forward I mean I appreciate where we're trying to go with this that I'm hearing an undercurrent that were going to tax the rest of the people in the state of California this $52 tax in order to backfill $1 billion or so of the truck weight fee.
8147	Roth	Richard	106	7aIanLUJ17E	1559	1572	Are you saying that 2,000 hours behind-the-wheel makes you a better classroom teacher than somebody who's spent 1,000 hours, or somebody who's spent 500 hours, or somebody who's spent 100?
8148	Mathis	Devon	75	BQi8S-IClhU	1024	1037	The campuses already have that information, so why are we spending the resources to ask them again what they already have?  When they report that up every single year as part of their regular process and their plan?
8149	Beall	Jim	92	D-fVk6CkUDE	1436	1451	I think it's very important that we have those kinds of conditions, you know because there going to be proposed all over the state, everywhere, everywhere, there are going to be proposals in all urban areas.
8150	Hall	Isadore	1	MvS4M4JYJ2g	208	236	Okay, that has four to zero, remain open. We are waiting for Senator Allen. And Senator Anderson. We will. Senator Lara, you have a bill, would you like to?
8151	McGuire	Mike	93	zWP9Ch_UvEs	911	938	When illegal rentals happen, or when illegal rentals aren't pairing their fair share of tourist taxes, and 431 California cities, and 55 out of 58 counties have tourist tax laws on the books, it unfairly degrades the quality of life in our communities, depriving the rest of us the funds we need to be able to maintain safe neighborhoods, smooth streets, and clean parks.
8152	Lara	Ricardo	107	mork537FlJg	158	176	Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. I was like, wow, you have a lot of bills for a Republican. Joking, joking. So, I'm sorry, you have three items with us. You are waiving on 429 and 590.
8153	Bonilla	Susan	3	zOcsFgJ-ERA	323	343	That's very important and yes, we do need you all the time to come and share your perspective with us. Particularly here in the Assembly where we didn't have the benefit of the Senate hearing, so I do appreciate you making the sacrifice and the effort to be here. I do have some questions of the author around the bill that have been raised to me and
8154	Chiu	David	7	PPBgSxp7D00	1316	1333	And I appreciate your consideration of AB 1096 which would modernize the provisions of California law that affect electric bicycles and clarify where E-bikes can travel. And first, at the outset, I'd like to accept the amendments suggested by the committee. And again, thank the committee staff for their good work with our office.
8155	Bonilla	Susan	3	zOcsFgJ-ERA	343	367	I want to raise them so we can just have an open discussion about them. One was the definition of a terminal condition, terminal without treatment, and whether that was gonna open the door around some chronic conditions. Whether there was gonna be enough protection in the bill to say, you know, this is truly the terminal patient,
8156	McCarty	Kevin	22	GE9yKeDoFKQ	1892	1901	It's not really a question for you, but it's really a question for all of us. Is that next year there will be another pilot failure county and if you look at your bill.
8157	Quirk	Bill	23	3RaYOjkmn6U	1687	1708	Okay, thank you. I would like to see more of the details of that again, if we could sit down perhaps with my staff and get the particulars. The only verifiable number you mentioned was in Germany, where the number of trafficked victims, at least in terms of prosecutions, went down.
8158	Mendoza	Tony	52	2Yu9E6dAMwM	1396	1406	You know that you are at the bottom of the ranks. You know that you have to build up your seniority, build up the, your skillset and sometimes during a bad economy you kind of have to,
8159	Roth	Richard	106	JZLdEqkqLz4	1475	1486	And what's the impact of this LAIF rate being up to 1% versus LAIF rate in effect over the life of the loan. What's the delta we're talking about here?
8160	Rodriguez	Freddie	69	elRk6CudldM	1575	1583	Yes, I wanna thank the author for bringing this bill forward and I just wanna see if you and the Department of Insurance will be able to work with some the opposition on some of their issues and concerns they're bringing forward.
8161	Hertzberg	Robert	99	DT3707YnrIQ	2019	2043	7-0, measure is out. Next, file item number 22, by Assemblymember Gatto. Due pass to Natural Resources and Water. A motion by Senator Beall. Currently 3-0 and with some admonition by Senator Beall that this needs to at your committee, Madam Chair, talk about drought resistant plants more than plastic grass. Okay? Secretary open the roll.
8162	Ting	Philip	30	WiCoRtyssyw	228	249	Great, thank you. Anyone else in support? Anyone in opposition? Questions from the committee? So the motion is due pass as amendatory appropriations. Is there a motion? Is there a second? Great. With that we'll take roll call vote.
8163	Maienschein	Brian	84	-v-krVjWW-I	1891	1911	You know, rather than from here. The mayor and council do have the authority to, to put people on this, to nominate people, approve them, to take them off, to change the charter, to really disband the entire, the entire organization, if necessary, and it has been functioning since 1975.
8164	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	OKwBdjBCkE8	766	789	This isn't an attempt to creating new or burdensome public hearing process with a commissioner aboard being created with hearings and appeals, rather it is making some basic common sense changes to the agency's enabling legislation that make the working of this agency more transparent, and that the decisions of the supervisor's simply more accountable.
8165	Leno	Mark	60	mzRsScITOGM	107	127	Of course, the tragic San Bruno explosion, which killed eight people, when an entire neighborhood went up in flames because a gas pipeline, severed, broke, exploded, that PG&E wasn't even aware was there, or was it seen, or wasn't it seen, didn't have the records to back it up.
8166	Beall	Jim	92	zKRXexcG8LM	355	372	Even if we can only reduce the unnecessary psychotropic drug use by 25%, the state would actually save $5.65 million annually. The bill has no opposition and I urge an aye vote.
8167	Quirk	Bill	23	4YUeKJp9AQ0	457	479	Senator Mitchell, in your opinion, would the non-profit homeowner's Association be impacted by this bill?  The people who testified in opposition, non-profit homeowners associations. They felt that they would be impacted by the bill. They'd be held liable?
8168	Nielsen	Jim	68	y2dm_Q__xog	650	676	Folks, the cost of regulations is out of control in the State of California, very particularly including underground regulations, that do not have any statutory basis or foundation, are in the billions of dollars. So to finance and to the Governor, I'll argue this is a very small expense to incur.
8169	Leno	Mark	60	0ONi8JCQxHk	647	667	Last year we had lines of people who came from San Francisco, earnest small property owners, urging committee members to vote against the bill, and in their comments they said, "Please don't kick me out of my home. I've lived there 30 years. I've worked hard."
8170	Hill	Jerry	66	843OfhKnV14	989	1006	It should be open to, as our legislature has a 122 members, as the city council has five, board of supervisors generally five, it allows for that collective wisdom that's brought together to make those decisions, and to guide and direct the executive director and staff.
8171	Weber	Shirley	44	vjC4sV_362o	1292	1309	Then that little man in the black over there says women can't have as much rights as men because Christ wasn't a woman. Where did your Christ come from? Where did your Christ come from? From God, and a woman.
8172	Dodd	Bill	71	r49jrzf4Gi8	442	459	Potential future water storage facilities in the vicinity of RD108 present opportunities for the district to develop power from low cost, clean hydroelectric generation. Generation of hydroelectric power benefits the environment, as well as RD 108 customers.
8173	Leno	Mark	60	Z0exSkj14Bo	63	90	Then switching subjects, I just want to ask a brief question with regard to just the more comprehensive nature of the cleanups themselves. What's the nature of the community involvement or process? Because so often as we saw many of these situations devolve, that I'm thinking, Exide among others.
8174	Weber	Shirley	44	VKxy9ObXcUg	346	372	Okay, cuz I know there a lot of pieces that go into it. Whether it's the schools, the economics, the options, the career developments, all those kinds of things. And I'm not sure what's in Stockton. So, when I see it on the news every morning, and every evening I become concerned, as to whether, or not all the pieces are in place that make a difference for the people there in terms of creating options, and opportunities for young people, to not only do well in school.
8175	Hill	Jerry	66	mZDplXo566U	1070	1088	This year, my office sent another two emails, I have them here, including one earlier this month, to set up a meeting with legal division. Neither received a response. This is not the only example of a lack of responsiveness, but it is not, it is to me the most egregious.
8176	Leno	Mark	60	EkjCB3EukYI	122	153	illegal to sell these products to minors, but they are being marketed to minors. They're been marketed in flavors such as gummy bears and watermelon and mountain dew. And, the sugar sweet flavors to attract young people and they're being very successful and doing this. What this bill will do to make sure that we don't lose another generation to the addiction of toxic
8177	Mayes	Chad	79	dQgHkZmLQFo	1481	1502	That is not what this bill does. Instead, this is a more modest proposal, which recognizes that the intent of the SRA fee is to fund fire prevention, not fire protection or suppression. With that in mind, this bill holds that if a property pays a local district for prevention services, the SRA fee should be reduced by the amount paid for those services.
8178	Lara	Ricardo	107	qM5DAHMb8ig	630	645	7-0, that measure is out. Next we have SB 323. Secretary, please call the roll. Oh, sorry, skipped that one. I'm sorry, we have SB 667. By Senator Jackson, Secretary, please call the roll.
8179	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	Uu6l955bq80	2052	2070	And I want to thank my staff, the judiciary committee staff, and my personal staff from the women's legislative women's caucus on this issue this has been a passion of mine forever because as a young girl  I was pre title nine.
8180	Alejo	Luis	9	4MjmF7EnXtg	1971	1981	But we've got a lot of input so far from a lot of stakeholders trying to address a lot of the concerns. Including those concerns coming from the Governor's office.
8181	Bonta	Rob	85	n_QC4AsmdBs	96	115	Given those statistics, workforce and succession planning is critical if we hope to maintain the institutional knowledge that keeps our state departments functioning efficiently. I believe that both of these efforts, civil service reform and succession planning, can benefit by including a focus on the commitment the state has made to equal employment opportunity.
8182	Thurmond	Tony	4	kWtMirkLI5M	931	944	Absolutely, the clerk will read the motion and then we can have action from the committee. Whatever is the pleasure of the committee to either move the item or if there's a desire for another motion. The clerk will read the motion.
8183	Pan	Richard	96	NAcngTShkgg	375	398	larger plans who would have most of their enrollees at a lower rate because they're larger given the nature of the tiers. And the potential result of that could be that we have a situation where the mid-size plans are essentially driven out of business or bought up. And we would have no mid-sized commercial plans because of the disadvantage.
8184	De Leon	Kevin	102	_C-l6C8Fln0	615	632	You can no longer be a belief that a person works hard and plays by the rules and he or she can provide for their family. It's our job to make that a reality. Partisanship on both sides won't get as more green parks in our neighborhoods. Partisanship won't allow our children to clean, or I should say, drink clean water.
8185	Gomez	Jimmy	80	oObwrA_56LI	1288	1305	But Vern noticed an idea embedded in the dream that economic segregation crushes the soul of men and women as much as the baton of racial segregation. That was the idea that compelled him to take a leadership role in his local printers union. By the end of the 1960s he had moved on to become an organizer for AFSCME international in their Washington DC headquarters.
8186	Stone	Mark	20	W1_xO6aMQ1g	1294	1343	The better we get at authentication the rest of this stuff goes by the wayside because it's not, you know, back to your paper money the only authentication was who's holding it and making that transaction. So if we're and where technology ultimately comes in is improving the authentication piece that makes the rest of and since the laws have in their way artificially or arbitrarily moved the risk from one party to another and that's what the policy does and that's sort of our role is establish that from the matter of policy who carries what risk, but the real protection is that authentication piece which we've only really barely touched on here because that's kind of out of our realm here once we've decided who's responsible for what and that's ultimately the most important.
8187	De Leon	Kevin	102	SU8_KAMcIaE	484	513	On the issue with the agricultural workers, agribusiness, as well as correctional workers who must travel long distances and bus way services that they have to and from, obviously, very long distances and, what can we do to actually replace these types of fossil fuel burning transportation buses?
8188	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	47vy5JeX0sg	826	839	The bills are deemed read. Under considerations of the daily file under governor's appointments file item four, colleagues. Senator De Leon, do you wish to present? Senator De Leon?
8189	Hancock	Loni	98	GhKzo4q2ixY	1519	1563	Okay, so it's about $210,000 per patient? But that's a lot of money and a lot of therapy that you can buy on the open market in different ways. It's of interest to me how we spend that money and what kinds of outcome we get. DOF, do you have any comments on the report? We've had questions from the subcommittee.
8190	Bloom	Richard	2	17weTAXeEGA	64	78	AB 1330 sets a conservative, but tangible goal for achievement of energy efficiency in the state. That goal is 1.5% of the state's current peak by 2020 and 2% by 2025.
8191	Chavez	Rocky	83	J7_DGCQOA4w	1134	1165	And the only last comment as you look at this, a lot of us sit in all the different committees. I sit on health and then education. And it doesn't matter if it's dental for children, Medi-Cal, Cal grants. Which strikes me so much is that as the seventh largest economy in the world we have the third of California's population at poverty level That's a family of four, $24,000.
8192	Weber	Shirley	44	7vSg9-FP5Qk	392	414	I mean, we can see with the situation in Baltimore that it was a very diverse group of people who did whatever that was done or who allegedly did what was done. So what would we have seen differently, if there had been truly a diverse force that was diverse in terms of its mentality. How it looked at people? Who it stopped? Who it didn't stop? How it handled people.
8193	Leyva	Connie	62	UpKpxYjD9F8	265	281	And I think it's just absurd to say that Teacher Unions will propose lower standards. Does anyone really think that the Teachers Union wants teachers to fail? That they want teachers to not do a good job? If our teachers don't do a good job and they're not successful, our children aren't successful.
8194	Stone	Jeff	26	Ezi_nx0zhx8	300	321	Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, for Assemblyman Daly, appreciate you being here today. It's been claimed that this bill is gonna close loopholes, but federal and state laws have been consistent since the early 1940s. Prevailing wages do not apply to off site manufacturers serving multiple customers.
8195	Thurmond	Tony	4	8w2MCxTnakA	1113	1127	From, what I'd like to articulate on the record and if we can do so in the language going forward, is to say that we think that there are many projects that are worthy of being supported and funded to meet the need of a great number of years.
8196	Leyva	Connie	62	UpKpxYjD9F8	245	264	I do know very well that retiree heath care is extremely expensive. I spent many years of my life negotiating those benefits. So we can find a way to make that better. And higher wages, God forbid our teachers can actually pay their bills and come to school and educate all the future and not be worried about paying their bills.
8197	Mitchell	Holly	64	0QEuIEsELpg	142	159	When providers are able to answer patient questions over the phone or electronically, it reduces unneeded office visits and wait times for consumers. In turn, increasing the capacity providers to treat more patients in person.
8198	Stone	Jeff	26	U5tNwb5MlsY	542	565	Expanding and improving California's water storage capacity is long overdue. And the last time we saw the state and federal investments in our water and delivery systems was in the nineteen sixties, when our population stood at 16 million state California. Today that same system supports 38 million people and will need to support the 50 million by 2050.
8199	Brown	Cheryl	13	MJ3yc4dhcxc	514	545	Right, we're coming into another world, I guess you could say. AB 914 would grant the San Bernardino Associated Governments, SANBAG, authority to implement an express lane program in the county on I-10 and I-15, those corridors. The I-10 and the I-15 corridors are amongst the most congested in the state, seeing up to 260,000 and
8200	Nguyen	Janet	65	vHDzhT6IdSE	58	77	Between 1979 and 1994, approximately 1 million Vietnamese applied through this program, with a majority relocated to the United States. The United States and the government of Vietnam also established The Humanitarian Resettlement Program, which accepted re, refugee applications between 2005 and 2008.
8201	Waldron	Marie	29	rhQS6ToXbi0	1128	1149	In 2014, graphic naked poses surfaced of actress Jennifer Lawrence on twitter and a hacker responsible said to have sixty images in his possession of the Hunger Games star. That's a clear violation of privacy. The actress did not know she was hacked into not intend for her personal photos to be leaked and sent out to the public.
8202	Perea	Henry	33	cflx69hA7mw	507	520	AB 1412, would allow accelerated repayment of the loan made between the former redevelopment agency and the city of San Joaquin. Existing law sets a maximum annual loan repayment amount on sponsoring entity loans.
8203	Garcia	Cristina	112	95pquWUVfBw	626	642	To continue to say is adoption your path or kind of help you see a sponsor to help you get clean so you can share for your child. Those choices should exist and I don't feel that having this disclaimer limits or stops those institutions, those groups and having those discussions on a regular basis with the individuals.
8204	Mitchell	Holly	64	9eBx3f-E0dc	7	32	Women and Inequality, Strategies to Promote Opportunity. We've got, this is a busy time of year. Those of you who are seasoned advocates, you know that Appropriations Committee is convening today and so we'll have members of the Committee in and out and I may ultimately have to leave at some point to present two bills in Appropriations. So we hope that you will understand.
8205	Pan	Richard	96	BDjsPtF4Upk	539	556	It doesn't really describe the parameters of the process. Now the proponents will say they actually have a sort of a process in place, and so we quickly move there but yet they're not willing to put that process into the bill and say we're going to use that specific process.
8206	Monning	Bill	25	yazHaGYtVx4	1829	1846	So, I think this is for Ms. Blakemore on page thirteen you cited the data on racial disparities. How can the expenditures be so much greater for one category than others?
8207	Alejo	Luis	9	2vYcwmo23_E	1013	1043	I don't know if you have any suggestions of what are some of those policies that are the best practices but might have that balance in terms of dealing with specifically the public records act part of it,. Because I think I think as policy-makers, I think we also want to encourage police departments to utilize technology especially if it has promising results as we've seen in  some of the early research done it. But, at the same time we have to, as we do in many legislation, is try to find a balance between different interests.
8208	Bigelow	Frank	91	kJUQLNRw8o8	182	198	Mr. Alejo, I just would like to thank you for bringing this bill forward and having worked with my office in actually giving me an opportunity to read through this. And when we get a chance and get a quorum, I'd be happy to make a motion to move this bill forward.
8209	Hall	Isadore	1	zjaMes6iB6Q	901	920	Currently some tenants may be sub leasing there apartments or rooms and be unaware that they are violating their lease. This legislation will help protect tenants by encouraging them to check their lease or rental agreement to make sure they are not in violation.
8210	Thurmond	Tony	4	dQgHkZmLQFo	23	44	It makes it more compelling, how about that? Thank you Mr. Chair and members of the committee. It is an honor to present AB 1496, a proactive measure that would require the Air Resource Board in consultation with local air districts to monitor and regulate and ultimately reduce emissions of methane in order to protect air quality, public health, and to reduce global warming.
8211	Leno	Mark	60	yzBzen_uFsA	25	47	Chair, before we get to opposition, could I ask a question to the author? So, clearly AB-32 got our ball rolling, and from that it made sense that we would establish a renewable portfolio standard. It would make sense that we deal with each of the sectors that contribute greenhouse gas emissions.
8212	Nguyen	Janet	65	c8SqTr4brJk	1257	1274	This is a report that is a statute that requires an officer at that scene of a domestic violence incidence, that if there's any weapons involved, firearms or deadly weapons, that they are reported.
8213	Roth	Richard	106	TPx_LL6qRDw	182	215	Well, it occurred to me as I'm sitting here that I'm delighted that the veteran's court operations is a success, and I think we should rejoice in that. But it also occurs to me that at the time that we're celebrating this success, in order for it to work, vets have to be in court. And I think it illustrates a fundamental problem and a systemic failure in our system that we're not focusing on this issue at the beginning of the process,
8214	Leno	Mark	60	BcOJ4WzBt0M	1002	1039	Thank you. I would agree with my colleagues. I think this is a policy change as well and should be further vetted, but at this point, we're going to hold this open.
8215	Bigelow	Frank	91	QuM5Nab-xN8	2220	2234	You know, I just want to share with the body here, because as we go from here will be going to the floor with this. You've just witnessed a very collaborative negotiation that came together.
8216	Leno	Mark	60	07ilphfHuEw	486	509	So it does so by modifying graduated investing for retiree health care benefits from the current 10 years to 20 years and to 15 to 25 years from the 10 to 20 to 15 to 25 for new bargaining unit nine and bargaining unit 10 employees hired after January 1st of 2016
8217	Thurmond	Tony	4	2cybSlRCgP0	877	890	I know that directly because I lived in some of the programs that served the consumers to support them around the clock. And so I think we need to take as much time as we can to support each consumer. If we can do it quickly, we do it quickly.
8218	Leno	Mark	60	5oljCvpfO9A	1513	1537	Alright, very good thank you. Let's see. A little clarification on Head start please. How many slots are there in California for Head Start programs and  if I needed childcare, if I qualify for Head Start, do I also qualify for one of our many programs and how would I know which way to go, and how does that shake out?
8219	Hancock	Loni	98	JI861kYqkEk	1358	1382	Fine. Okay. You reference in the MOU draft that I got yesterday that you're going to work together on metrics and standards and I wondered when those might be done. Do you have a timeline?
8220	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	ZM99l_dNJfs	942	967	OK. To our official from Butte County, I appreciate the presentation. It seems like the other demographic is lagging in terms of participation. It's also the 40 to 64, 44 to 64-year-old group, what might we be able to impact the-- did you think are likely to get them. Because that's different than high school students since students in college are maybe more transient.
8221	Cooper	Jim	21	Mfs9_24i5lo	2449	2465	And if you ever need it, you want to make sure the whatever plan you're involved in is solvent. Cuz ultimately these members are out there risking their lives day in and day out for the public. So, you know, my big issue is, it's gotta be solvent, no matter what plan it is. And that's really the key to it.
8222	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	IRk3z3ZISoY	1864	1891	Well actually, that is a subject of a stand alone bill that we heard in the Senate Labor Committee that's been brought by Assemblymember Campos-- yes, thank you--to address that so that is not a factor because we do know that sadly women are historically underpaid from the beginning of their work experience and so it's impossible to catch up.
8223	Chau	Ed	116	2b3SgDbb8jI	358	377	Absolutely. Just one brief comment to address Mr. Jones' concern. One of the amendments that we'll be considering is to allow cities to use parking studies from previous years to conduct that negotiation process. So, we'll be presenting that on the floor, thank you very much. With that, I respectfully ask for an aye vote.
8224	Lara	Ricardo	107	vwnSyW8C-l8	665	688	That is why we are here today trying to address a critical issue that is vital to the success of, not only of Californians, but of our California economy. It behooves us to provide this funding for undocumented community as opposed to spending the billions of dollars we spend every year on trying to address this issue.
8225	Pan	Richard	96	dCf0VaDDxwk	704	730	Those funds, as they return to our state, also helps stimulate our economy, because those funds are paying for, not only services, they're paying for jobs. Jobs for delivering health care, developing help for our developmentally disabled that are needed services. And that will also help contribute to our economy while ensuring that we take care of many of our most vulnerable.
8226	Mitchell	Holly	64	zKRXexcG8LM	1502	1528	Case in point: national bi-partisan call for reform. A national bi-partisan consensus has emerged for an end to equitable sharing. On January 9, 2015, Republican chairs of both the US Senate and house Judiciary Committee's wrote to former US Attorney general Eric Holder, asking that the us Department of Justice end the practice. They wrote, permission to read madame President?
8227	Mathis	Devon	75	jj5fwuuTvrg	1865	1885	We have over a thousand wells that are dry, with over 7,000 people who don't have drinking water. They cannot flush a toilet, they cannot bathe their children, but folks we are talking about a train versus the future of our children. I ask for your aye vote.
8228	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	UpjsW9YiW28	1020	1038	if there's a challenge that you end up showing that it couldn't be made elsewhere we're arguing over the five and the 10%. I'd like to propose a compromise and ask you. My understanding is that you were willing to accept these amendments, but we're arguing over the 5% or the 10%.
8229	Alejo	Luis	9	sR3YZBZSyxQ	371	386	AB 1075 provides a bright line for regulatory action at facilities that have demonstrated a repeating pattern of serious violations. The Senate amendments would remove opposition of business groups, including removing opposition for the Chamber of Commerce. I respectfully ask for an aye concurrence.
8230	Wood	Jim	72	TYBUIhFGo6I	934	952	I think, as we look forward to the next session here, and challenges and opportunities, I think this will become apparent. I do have, actually, one question for Mr. Brown. You said that you currently connected 300 facilities. In a perfect world, how far do we have to go?
8231	Huff	Bob	105	HutoDdelxCc	187	198	That's not our job to divvy it up and I know there's ten-dollar request for every dollar available but I think this is a very compelling need. In this Education Committee when it's appropriate I would like to move this bill.
8232	Galgiani	Cathleen	95	gAWN8j6c6Vc	448	470	And in a year like this year when we have a drought, that only complicates the problem. Because without enough water flow, the water hyacinth, it's not pushed out into the salt water where it then is killed naturally by salt. So there's all of these things that people locally, they just intuitively know.
8233	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	0MzTgkt-Llc	832	849	Yes, thank you. Given the fact that this is a state that goes from up in Eureka down to San Diego, there are different parts of the state which have different wildlife that attracts tourists, that provides quality of life, that allows for hunters and fisher people.
8234	Hernandez	Roger	37	MO4QFekCxFk	1598	1615	I'm gonna be, I'd be kicking myself in the butt if I knew dollars were going to affluent communities that maybe perhaps didn't need the dollars as critically. So, I can't be there today. I'm 100% with your intent, but I can't be there with this kind of language.
8235	Hernandez	Ed	103	X49dPLJib5g	218	228	And I still am not 100% sure where the votes are yet because it seemed like there was a lot of division, and I still think there's a lot of work and progress in this particular bill.
8236	Pavley	Fran	104	Ab32yuFXwvM	941	964	DOGGR, by our math count, has 244.9 authorized positions. We don't have the statistics to show how many were actually filled. The summary is DOGGR has received authorization for 53 positions over 7 million in ongoing funding for UIC related programs including data management.
8237	McGuire	Mike	93	i3P-QI4InjM	1598	1619	And using that language to look at foregrounds that a city and or county can be able to utilize if need be if there's concerns regarding the environment and environmental impacts. I know the assembly member wanted to make a statement in regards to CEQA in particular.
8238	Chau	Ed	116	0hkCdiDRiI0	1575	1595	Yeah I think that was addressed briefly. As of today, we have not received any revocation per se. However in the, in the San Luis Obispo area, we have had practitioners who received notification from the federal government saying that the designation is gonna be lost. So there is a threat that that may happen.
8239	Melendez	Melissa	41	vYqU_TjNJ4I	64	82	This is further compounded by the Governor's recent call for a 25% additional reduction in water use. We are currently working with the committee and the franchise tax board on technical and implementation is, amendments, that will significantly lower the cost of this bill, and lower the loss of revenue to this state.
8240	Monning	Bill	25	ospSq9hYks4	479	494	Thank you, you've been great champions in that area. But again, it's something the numbers don't reflect. When you don't have the access at the front end to just that basic consultation with the family, it's not even a procedure that's reflected other than a newly established patient.
8241	Cooper	Jim	21	gmSplS1IxCE	1082	1093	So it is a major problem right now with that, and I just think this is a slippery slope. I support medicinal marijuana, but I think we're  heading the wrong direction, especially for our children, and that's really the big effect we're gonna have.
8242	Beall	Jim	92	E1_HgghcmCU	2334	2356	We have a motion on the floor. We vote on his motion. You wanna make another motion after it doesn't pass you can do that. ... we don't have all the members here so. Okay, any further questions, we'll call the question and have the vote on motion. It's to do pass with, with a two year?
8243	Mitchell	Holly	64	Gcdptg51L2I	1179	1265	Colleagues to give you a status update the Assembly is having a democratic caucus and there is a bill we're waiting on. Senator Monning, for what purpose do you rise?
8244	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	43wK_WUALhw	876	891	But are there any measurements, are there any performance, I was thinking, as I was talking earlier, this is really kind of performance-based or result-based programs. We wanna see the numbers.
8245	Brown	Cheryl	13	bXJhxM-W13s	532	570	I think we have to be really careful because you depend on the churches and you depend on the community groups and where they get the funds from? They get it from the parishioners and from the members and from that same community, and if you come from a really poor community, then you don't have the kind of resources. Now, if you're in a wealthier community, let's say. Then maybe that works. But when everyone is poor? What happens and how do we how do we fashion a proposal or grant so that you can get in there and do the work.
8246	Anderson	Joel	57	SCWpb6PxRGE	304	332	And I think that it, it, it's a terrible shame when it's so difficult for a company that wants to do the right thing. To fail and typically these small companies, I have them come into my office all the time. Some of them, you know, are working as hard as they can to try to comply with the laws, but they change so rapidly it's very difficult for them.
8247	Lackey	Tom	10	2HmztWZsIt4	392	406	So, I think that this type of intervention is critical to those who rely on us to help them, and I see that this has a very, very meaningful pathway and I'm proud to support it.
8248	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	CRMwg6_WO3E	205	221	Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members.  AB 1266 is an effort to increase transparency in accountability when public utilities charge rate payers for multi billion dollar bonuses for their executives, despite having major safety violations in the preceding months and years. Currently executive compensations are incorporate into a general rate case.
8249	Beall	Jim	92	TzXQpLlHzt8	1095	1121	For transportation related projects and quite frankly I'm a little skeptical of the way its laid out right now but I'd like to see, you know, show me how it works and see how we can improve our greenhouse gas emissions as well as meet the goals we have in our state for the economy as well. So thank you.
8250	Hernandez	Ed	103	nMgNQIdoyHs	776	804	It should not be so easy for children to get a hold of this deadly drug. The time is to act now. This bill provides a new solution to combat the continued use of this poisonous and ultimately deadly product. I have witnesses with me that would like to speak in support and I respectfully ask for an aye vote, Mr Chair and members.
8251	Hueso	Ben	48	_oTJFwpIX6s	60	82	So important in the minds of some. Of the states that were of Mexico, with the exception of Texas that had an earlier secession, of those states that came from Mexico, slavery was never introduced into any of the Mexican states even if the law allowed for some to decide to introduce slavery.
8252	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	IKESHE_NOXc	845	872	Under privileges of the floor, I believe Senator Morrell, does Senator Morrell have--? Would you like to preceded this point Senator? Very good. At Senator De Leon's desk Senator Morrell.
8253	Bloom	Richard	2	qzvpjn8Cr2Y	1618	1631	It was recorded as not voting, but I had actually voted no. I am content to leave, after now I've got a lot of time to think about it, and I'm okay with not voting, so we'll leave it as not voting.
8254	Monning	Bill	25	Ln1AhL9Lp3Y	1288	1303	Thank you. And then, for the witnesses from Tulare, it seems like, at least through your testimony, there's a culture around the school that has embraced the use of this mascot for decades.
8255	Bonta	Rob	85	M5Sfl5zR2ew	355	372	Thank you for your presentations. I know that this is a bill that has engendered some interest and some questions from Assembly Members. I want to give Members the opportunity now to ask any of the witnesses who just testified any questions that they might have. Assembly member Thurmond.
8256	Hueso	Ben	48	_oTJFwpIX6s	37	60	And during that time, the issue of the day was slavery. And the victory of the Pueblas was a change in the tide of this expansion of slavery and a lot of times people don't recall the period in terms of the issues of the day that were.
8257	Gomez	Jimmy	80	QXW5aikdMmE	321	345	AB 853, R. Hernandez, Electrical and Gas Corporations direct employees, do pass. B roll call. AB 857, Perea, California Clean Truck, Bus and Off-road Vehicle program, do pass. A roll call. AB 865, Alejo, energy commission diversity, do pass. B roll call.
8258	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	FGjC95aJgzI	1702	1720	Very good, thank you. All right, questions by the members? I know this issue somewhat, and I want to tell you how much I admire the fact that you have actually come very close to an agreement.
8259	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	TF5gOrTe590	1232	1252	If it's beyond the scope of practice. I'm a recovering lawyer and I would consider, in my scope of practice, there were areas where I had significant differences of opinion and analysis from others within the same scope of practice.
8260	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	jSYoUQmoG0c	1569	1592	And, I think, we can walk, work, walk through that. But, first, I need for individuals to be amenable to at least, to even try to, to work with, with talking to people who were formerly incarcerated. Because at the end of the day, we have not, I repeat, this legislation does not strip their ability to say no.
8261	Weber	Shirley	44	9oY9RNUdfPk	437	457	I could have never done this in 24 months, because I got halfway through it and then I would have had to drop something or change something. But the support we gave her has made a difference in her life immensely. So that she now is a contributing member to society, and one of our staffers for my office in San Diego, and working on legislation, and everything else.
8262	Gomez	Jimmy	80	rzSOQHmJW3U	198	238	oh sorry, B roll call. I tried. I know you're there. SB 21 Hill, requires disclosure of donations to pay for travel of public officials, do pass. A roll call. SB 25 Roth, Local government finance, property tax revenue allocation, vehicle license fee adjustments for newly incorporated cities, do pass with technical amendments. A roll call. SB 27 Hill, use of antimicrobial drugs on livestock,
8263	Wieckowski	Bob	55	CzqJO_Zd50k	1211	1231	Lets turn back to the chaparral, cause I know that in the grasslands when the sheep farmers came, or sheep herders came, the sheep would pull up the roots of the grass. And then that allowed for the replacement of the grass with the chaparral.
8264	Holden	Chris	78	nGcU-tnoqVY	1184	1201	That's right. That's right, Senator. What we tried to do, is we were increasing the time frame to 60 days. We had an opportunity to meet with the Chair, as well as the opposition. He was very thoughtful with trying to bring everyone together. We appreciated that effort.
8265	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	m48b5iZN1Uo	1010	1023	Thank you, and I just want to give any members an opportunity to ask any questions. Hopefully you can keep it brief cuz we're on a tight schedule, but while we have them there, if there's any burning questions that you may have.
8266	Alejo	Luis	9	uR7IVED3sSY	1039	1067	This bill is a reintroduction of a 2014 bill Senate bill 1365 put out by now, Secretary of  State, Alex Padilla. Last year's efforts, by then, Senator Padilla, made it through both houses  of the Legislature but was vetoed by Governor Jerry Brown. This year, with the help of our sponsors, we have taken several amendments to meet the concerns of the Governor and stakeholders in the hopes to ensure that the voting strength of minority communities is not eluded. I respectfully ask for an aye vote, and have some folks to testify in support.
8267	Cooley	Ken	45	gXZO0cZqlQg	1009	1027	There we got, got a mic here. Colleagues Good morning colleagues, I am pleased to present to you today Assembly Bill 924. This bill will reinstate the Children's Trust Fund as a donation option for persons on the state income tax.
8268	Patterson	Jim	119	YZmREa72UrQ	238	257	Thank you, Mr. Chair and members. Thank you for the opportunity to present AJR 18 to you today. Joint author Assembly Gatto and I will be accepting the committee suggested amendments. Wildfire is an ever-present threat to California. It's made worse by the drought and overgrown forests.
8269	Quirk	Bill	23	_X0X2xyZ8Ek	1691	1716	You have tremendous recommendations. My Chief of Staff Tomas is in the corner there. If you could work with her over the next time. Certainly talk today, but over the next couple of months, all of your recommendations make sense to me. Particularly, I wanted to understand why expungement's not working,
8270	Bloom	Richard	2	GV2uLrBMX6U	1010	1024	Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would also that we adjourn in memory of Rabbi Harold Schulweis. Rabbi Schulweis presided over one of Los Angeles' largest Jewish congregations. As eloquently pointed out by Assembly Member Nazarian, Rabbi Schulweis fervently believed in practiced and taught one of the basic Jewish tenets of (Hebrew), our obligation to repair the world.
8271	Gordon	Richard	117	9MQl_MfHN90	991	1005	For private party sales which amount to 60% of used car sales, AB 287 would require private party sellers to inform potential buyers of any and all recalls prior to sale, similar to the current requirement around odometer discloser.
8272	Bates	Pat	58	0yf1SfBcDOs	2381	2390	I think, I know I'm gonna support it, but I think what Senator Vidak said is basically the common denominator of many things we do around here, we represent the people.
8273	Jones	Brian	42	D-fVk6CkUDE	1673	1686	So this concept is already in place under the DCA. AB 921 will also allow for DCA to voluntarily collect email addresses for its licensees. There's a lot of E's in those two words.
8274	Melendez	Melissa	41	7f5uDPxTBXo	778	794	I know that probably makes the Chair cringe, but there's good reason for this. This would bring the penalty into consistency with other false filings for restraining orders. An example being a petition for domestic violence restraining order, which would be a felony.
8275	Baker	Catharine	74	FmLLF1I4yf4	773	785	So with that, I'd also like to note, we have received no opposition to this legislation, but have recently received letters of support. They came in after the committee was able to prepare materials for members, I'm happy to provide copies of those today.
8276	Mitchell	Holly	64	TUih-0idsQU	1363	1386	A couple things, I'm looking at the letter you penned June 30. Yes. Where the final paragraph you restate, you restate what we've talked about repeatedly, what the time frame is, in terms of finding our new, within federal compliance, MCO alternative.
8277	Irwin	Jacqui	16	IEHFBfAx3rE	646	658	Since then, armed conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have added a new generation of veterans returning to California, pushing our vet population to more than 1.8 million, which adds to CalVet's challenge of serving our veterans.
8278	Frazier	Jim	114	iRcV3DgKWQw	1723	1753	So I mean, have all of these been looked at, you know, the conveyance of the water from the pumps to Southern California if a seismic event hit. Are the tunnels gonna be affected, what if they're affected in a seismic event, and no water flows for any period of time. And lastly, has anybody looked at a bypass at the pumps so species could just be reintroduced into the delta instead of being a cul-de-sac?
8279	Williams	Das	12	Rt-g3tEX78Q	911	960	Colleagues, please join me in welcoming from UC Santa Barbara -- go gauchos -- in the back of the chambers near the portico we've got these UCSB chapter of CALPER. Please welcome my guests from UC Santa Barbara.
8280	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	Iv2-QZj_dZk	1315	1335	Alrighty, very good. Thank you very much. Other witnesses in support, if you'd just step forward with name, rank, and serial number would be... Please we have a microphone if you, are you in opposition? Okay, very good. So let's have the opposition step forward.
8281	Leno	Mark	60	ELlYlrBZUfQ	637	654	So this seems assumable. And I want to be sensitive to the state employees who work at this facility. And correct me if some of my number are wrong, but I think there are around two to 300 officers there?
8282	Thurmond	Tony	4	v8EYhSKM6wc	244	265	And so, and I continued to struggle for many years, in spite of her really hard work. On every single standardized test I've ever taken in my life, from the CA, well, it was the California Achievement Test then, to the SAT to even the LSAT, I just bombed them. I just bombed them.
8283	Hertzberg	Robert	99	uGcU2KdVjhw	993	1014	Would you be willing to take an amendment? I'm not suggesting now, but I wanna exercise these ideas. This is the Legislature, we're supposed to ask ourselves the tough questions. Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson always asks and Senator Lara just started an investigation dealing with this notion of tax credits.
8284	Hertzberg	Robert	99	uGcU2KdVjhw	1014	1031	And if you claim you're gonna bring these jobs in and we're gonna give you a tax credit, shouldn't you be held accountable? Shouldn't the system be held accountable the same way? If you're saying we're gonna build on speculation, then maybe you build a mechanization bill to pay it back or to do something.
8285	Monning	Bill	25	r81aKKdk2dA	1306	1323	So if it were simply the issue of the independent medical review, maybe we could, but I still feel if there's the commitment to independent medical review, why not do it under a system that already exists, and I think the benefit of the uniformity on review, you know,
8286	Hertzberg	Robert	99	4MjmF7EnXtg	1534	1547	And the assumption that the delay is adversely affecting people of less means. Maybe that's not the case. Maybe there's a recalcitrant party and then we balance that against the environmental interests.
8287	Gipson	Mike	28	aX3hcacca8I	49	70	In Los Angeles County alone, there is an average of 6,000 hit-and-run accidents that result in death and injuries every year. AB 835 will give law enforcement the tools to prosecute these cases and provide justice for the families, whose lives have been shattered as a result.
8288	Block	Marty	59	k_l5daYZc00	617	630	Which tells where they wanna go. What their outcomes should be in eight, I think, different areas, one of which is Career and Technical Education. That by determining in advance their own district's goals and objectives. Because it will differ throughout the state.
8289	Perea	Henry	33	3kfM97VupkU	170	206	By incentivizing the deployment of 20,000 clean trucks, we will be cleaning up some of the State's biggest contributors to air pollution and greenhouse gasses. This is a very important opportunity, not just for California, but for places like the Central Valley and South Coast who are looking for every opportunity to reduce emissions in the near future as well as long into the future. We believe AB 857 is a critical piece to helping places like the San Joaquin Valley meet their air quality attainment goals set forth by the Federal Government and I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
8290	Williams	Das	12	DaiegGG5yrM	410	427	I also wanted to just address the definition question that was brought up by Ms. Burke on cost effective. That is a term in code already and technologically feasible. That's why it's used in both of our bills, and in the previous bill.
8291	Baker	Catharine	74	eQ53gxbhFGs	1011	1029	I think the reason why I'm also concerned, is this does appear to be an opt out, not an opt in. By making a change to the vehicle code which applies statewide, that makes, and saying in 21, 21, 5.5 that a city can make it's own regulations. That to me sounds like an opt out.
8292	Hill	Jerry	66	XrOqCob7jCo	569	591	SB 468 will require employers to report incidents involving the discharge of a firearm to the bureau. The bill will also require armed guard licensees to provide the bureau a form signed by a licensed mental health professional before receiving a renewing of a bureau issued fire arms permit.
8293	Stone	Jeff	26	IO307YMxf6Q	1555	1571	So the point I'm trying to make is that there's actually several legitimate non-discriminatory reasons why an employer will seek this information regarding the prior compensation of an applicant and certainly those that abuse that.
8294	Cooley	Ken	45	6rjOa1qOGPA	1342	1370	So from my standpoint of working with the county. It is the section of road we are transferring, terminates miles from the next county border continuing to the southeast, six or eight miles away. It is an area where growth is expected. That growth is a six county vision. So it, the planned growth throughout something known as the blue print here in Sacramento County.
8295	Melendez	Melissa	41	pY9wY6wExdc	807	828	I understand oftentimes the Chair is not open to opening up these type of penalties or lengthening sentences, but in this particular case this is a very vulnerable population. We definitely need to do something to try to deter this type of activity, so I will be supporting your bill today. Thank you.
8296	Gallagher	James	108	-Nb5xJu_Rq4	1069	1084	Just one, you know we have the rule on you know eight and under have to be in a car seat or booster, is there something is there data showing that even with the current law that somehow it's not working for kids under two?
8297	McGuire	Mike	93	EhsW00cBA0A	823	845	As you all know, issues arose last session that kept bills relating to this subject from passing. I believe moving this Legislature forward without a vested sponsor is the best way to achieve this. I believe only a general consensus bill will be successful this year, and we'll be working hard with all involved to secure a bill that will protect the public safety, patients, cultivators, and our environment.
8298	Hancock	Loni	98	vCSLi6vuU4c	533	547	I really don't. Is the general feeling that a bond program is best if we can streamline it and target it? I was trying to read between the lines here.
8299	Leno	Mark	60	Y13vuRnCz5Y	1221	1236	Thank you Senator Leno. Any other comments? I would like to just, there was one issue that I did not address with Mr. Ford. The concern about physicians determining coercion.
8300	McGuire	Mike	93	EhsW00cBA0A	807	823	Finally, we have intentionally advanced this bill without a sponsor. Our bottom line is this. We need to find a way to resolve serious issues highlighted in this presentation that are facing this great state related to issues of medical cannabis.
8301	Garcia	Eduardo	38	OHndMPLrpTA	1070	1081	As I mentioned, I represent an area with 21% unemployment. When this issue is raised, it is important to me irrespective of those 400 jobs not coming from my district or not.
8302	McGuire	Mike	93	qbDN-8u61LI	1983	1997	Finally, the issue with the water board, we're working directly with the regional board, along with the state water board, to get a look at comprehensive principles and rules and regulations, so that you don't have to guess no matter what county you're in.
8303	Beall	Jim	92	6q5JSfST1YQ	1964	1984	File item 1, Senate Bill 9 by Senator Beall. The motion is do pass as amended and we refer to the Committee on Appropriations. The current vote is five to zero, Chair and Vice Chair voting aye, Senators Allen? Bates? Aye. Bates aye. Galgiani? McGuire? Mendoza? Wieckowski. Aye. Wieckowski aye.
8304	Morrell	Mike	51	pnu4iUzw8JA	269	283	As stated today, the Manufacturers Association, I think, has 1.2 million people that are employed within this industry, although they've lost about seven hundred thousand jobs over the last ten years going to other states... more business friendly states.
8305	Bonta	Rob	85	L_fXwOpVblo	925	949	Members of the public, thank you for your patience. These are witnesses in opposition. We've already had witnesses state their substantive cases for three minutes each, so we're asking that... Excuse me, we have witnesses state their concerns. So now this is opposition.
8306	Wagner	Donald	88	uR7IVED3sSY	887	906	What happened to that bill last year? What happened to that bill last year that got out of this Committee unanimously? It obviously didn't become law. Did it get amended?
8307	Lopez	Patty	89	PZ5qNcZ4hzo	1650	1674	Thank you Mr. speaker and members. AB 568 established a two year pilot program to address the needs for individuals with development and intellectual disabilities. These individuals with the development disabilities,  they will be required unique setting services and support and this bill looks to make sure they have the support in place. I respectively urge your aye vote.
8308	Mitchell	Holly	64	v-mKCCNf7M4	2027	2044	Thank you very much for that summary. Finance? Any questions for members on those final two items on IHSS, any public comments? I thought you were going to get up, and you're just reaching for your, sorry about that.
8309	Santiago	Miguel	17	Hvyw9CxPJq8	701	727	The, what would really actually help strengthen it which I would never want to go there, but let me just say it for the sake of saying it, is there's the an actual, there's an actual fine to community colleges should they not reach the 75/25 but that would just exacerbate the problem of community colleges as not being funded because you would create a, you would enforce or enforce the fine which currently actually happens.
8310	Allen	Benjamin	70	uGcU2KdVjhw	1400	1414	It's nowhere near enough. I couldn't agree with you more. I think that part of what we're trying to do here though is make sure that transit's part of this conversation as part of this special session
8311	Santiago	Miguel	17	Hvyw9CxPJq8	677	692	And I know that I'm skipping a lot of different technical pieces, but having been on the other side of this, it's almost an unintended consequence or maybe a direct consequence that this bill actually helps the strengthening the 75/25 as I saw it.
8312	Brown	Cheryl	13	dAMeavSqnLk	256	272	Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members. I ask your aye vote on ACR 38. It has a bipartisan support. There's no opposition and I just asked for your concurrence and Senate amendments.
8313	Stone	Mark	20	rb93slzi3ec	804	863	This is specific to the case at hand of the crime that that child was convicted of. The promise and this has been the promise for 50 years. The promise to that child is that that offense will be deemed not to have happened, so if we don't seal the records, with respect to that case, then we cannot fulfill that promise. We're not actually, in this bill, creating the underlying sealing of the records. We're closing some loopholes, clarifying some provisions in the law about how that sealing happens, and now a lot of the opposition's asking for enhanced access under this bill and to me that doesn't make sense. The underlying objections to this bill that you're hearing are underlying, or objections to the existing law about what gets sealed, when it gets sealed, and how it happens. That's not what AB 666 is about.
8314	Weber	Shirley	44	_ES7C4KFvkc	567	581	I was interested in however we've come on following that, we'll obviously continue the conversation. We had mentioned the fact that these are supposed to be, in some of our language, high quality programs. And so I wanted to make sure that we basically emphasize that.
8315	Dababneh	Matthew	50	tC7sJemEjBU	1445	1458	We just wanna make sure after our meetings and within all the discussions we had, that those amendments would still keep the principal that the understanding that the health of the animal will be the only criteria considerment to determine whether an animal be suitable for adoption.
8316	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	xbFtMrlj2T4	716	724	Went back during the interim, talked to a number of environmental groups, in fact, if you notice there's no environmental opposition. In fact, we have environmental support for this.
8317	Hall	Isadore	1	31W9cfaQWLY	36	55	On March 7th 1965, non-violent protesters arrived at the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma, Alabama. They showed up to march, they showed up to be counted. They had come to demand voting rights that had been denied to millions of African-Americans and other minorities through the south and across America.
8318	Hadley	David	40	csda2pMKJRU	1603	1624	So, I'm proud to stand on the side of the small business men and women who provide these essential services and I'm proud to stand on the side of the customers who need to make sure that they have access to these services, even when travel or inconvenience is involved. You know, for, in the case for people who cannot travel, who cannot drive themselves and need notary services. So I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
8319	Moorlach	John	4657	0HDXR-Yl1D8	762	782	Is there any opposition? Please, would someone come and oppose this bill? Seeing no opposition Senator Jackson reviewing the financial statements for the State Bar, the pension system that they're using is CalPERS, is that correct?
8320	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	CH2-PAA9VHE	567	588	On August 29, 2013, United States Department of Justice issued a memorandum, a call memo, that updated its, its guide to all US attorneys, in light of state ballot initiatives to legalize, to understate law the possession of small amount of marijuana and provide for deregulation of marijuana production, processing, and sale.
8321	Anderson	Joel	57	4INVuEQu1gA	1285	1308	Achieving compliance upfront reduces costs for taxpayers by preventing the need for expensive retrofitting following products that have been completed. And, most importantly, it will avoid costly lawsuits when people are denied access. With me today I have many witnesses and they're eager to testify.
8322	Hernandez	Roger	37	FZTo8zIUL5Q	1476	1495	Well I was just gonna say the FBI has spoken on their concerns on this issue regarding the possibilities of money laundering and other illegal activities that could be increased with online gaming. I'm happy to provide you with FBI, what they have said on this issue. We'll provide that to your office.
8323	Beall	Jim	92	6z8E6Rb3Uio	98	109	Due to the fact that the states taxes are deductible from federal taxes reduction and the state tax liability increases, federal tax liability for the investor and with more--
8324	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	ZXZJp00flVo	1160	1174	So I have a concern I'm gonna share today. I'm gonna be supportive of this but I do have some questions as we move forward because we're going from a grant to an ADA formula. And I have some concerns of the overall impact on that of what that will be.
8325	Gatto	Mike	46	L_fXwOpVblo	243	260	If you take that argument to its logical conclusion that a lot of good is done, you could justify just about anything, and that's where I made the hypothetical about putting a roadblock at the entrance of every freeway and saying, "We wanna take a sample from every senior citizen, and we're gonna do experiments on the senior citizens' blood."
8326	Gipson	Mike	28	7yVOTftNjfw	963	991	Because the campuses keep the tuition fees, students pay the higher fees paid to non residential students has created an incentive for campuses to recruit more out of state students. Is this reducing the number of slots available for eligible California students? Has this policy created a new generation of unequal pre-student funding at the UC system and the campuses? I look forward to the discussion.
8327	Perea	Henry	33	hGRwdCC6_e8	1025	1046	Specifically the bill would allow for ground and water sustainability agencies access to P3s, would ensure the state entities such as the state prison and others are demonstrating compliance with the goals of SIGMA, clarify that the formation of GSA would not be subject to sequence. It would also ensure the states water and resources control board only go after bad actors that are no compliant respectively ask for your I vote.
8328	Cooley	Ken	45	XU82xqV8DPM	1362	1378	And is some of this a consequence of just, we have a statutory system that started a long time ago and some of these distinctions made at the time have had some logic, and now we keep building on it, and it just more and more becomes a jury rigged system?
8329	Pavley	Fran	104	Q93W3yN07bU	194	202	And it could be very helpful to people, whether it's the person trying to drill a  new well in the same aquifer, for how far down you have to go?
8330	Gipson	Mike	28	Htnfsa9QnRM	29	52	Current law requires the CSUs, and request that the community colleges and UC campuses, provide priority to current and former foster youth for on campus housing. Studies have shown that 40% of the foster youth becomes homeless.
8331	Bigelow	Frank	91	hGRwdCC6_e8	1052	1083	Thank you Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of AB617. Last year the legislator passed unprecedented to regulate California's ground water the sustainable ground water management better known as SIGMA well we have yet to feel the magnitude of SIGMA. We do know there's a need for more flexibility for administrating agencies, also oversight for implementation as well as compliance with deadline extensions. 617 will do just that. I would like to thank the author and the stakeholders for their continued hard work on AB617 and encourage a strong aye vote.
8332	Vidak	Andy	56	0yf1SfBcDOs	827	856	The 2013 USC LA Times poll found that 70% of those surveyed support being provided with the ability to re-vote on high-speed rail. A 2015 poll from Stanford found that only 16% of likely voters considered continuing high-speed rail as a top priority versus 47%, namimg improving our existing transportation infrastructure as needing the most attention from this Legislature and the Governor.
8333	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	gZ0_qo7XpYk	2113	2145	What we do here is we say when a new plant is built and I recognize that there were some problems with amendments that were-- there were just a miscommunication and now, again, we're correcting those problems. We are saying that when a new plant is built with new technologies that exist, we're asking every five years the CEC, the PUC, the ISO, and the ARB to tell us how we can, with these new technologies, further reduce greenhouse gas emissions with these plants.
8334	Nazarian	Adrin	36	6sTB7NUOGtE	826	842	Although what you clarified right now I think helps alleviate some of the concerns on the issue, but why don't we hold this item open. If you don't mind staying here and Mr Cooper you made a motion.
8335	Williams	Das	12	Uoe2v6pAgNg	2457	2466	I just wanted to note that this is one of the API caucuses' high priorities for the year. We have attempted to do a bill like this before as Mr. Bonta has indicated.
8336	Patterson	Jim	119	KQICDVGfqPQ	915	956	The suspects are still on the loose. At his service there was a remarkable outpouring of love and support for Giorgio and his family and friends would speak volumes about the way that this humble sweep godly man would live out his life as a professional, but also as a friend of many. He cherished his faith, he loved his family deeply, and he was surrounded in death by literally hundreds of families and friends.
8337	Hernandez	Ed	103	o6dY6yB1_H8	1490	1510	Thank you. This, as we know it, this issue was created in 1927. The CCS program provides diagnosis, treatment, and medical case management to 180,000 children with special healthcare needs who are enrolled in Medi-Cal and low income or have catastrophic medical costs.
8338	Chiu	David	7	adewtR6e1X4	221	237	Thank you, Mr. Chair. First of all I wanna thank the expertise, the panelists, as well as the many members of the public that have come to discuss this incredibly important set of questions. Both regards to the need, as well as how our state provides care in a humane way, and in a way that makes sense within our budget constraints.
8339	De Leon	Kevin	102	SxRX-lKXiDU	2222	2243	We are the epicenter, because I can't think of any other state or region in the country, whether it's the south, or the northeast, the midwest, or the northwest that has a political policy structure such as a South Coast Basin of AQMD.
8340	Weber	Shirley	44	7i9bh_kaYv0	148	162	So the oppositions that have been talked about, choice for parents, we're addressing the issue of choice and parents can continue to, basically provide either private school education for their children or choose to put them in at six years if they don't think they're ready at five.
8341	Alejo	Luis	9	dAAyQzjyhS0	168	179	For the second part of the hearing we want to hear more about the county's Disadvantaged Community Water Study for the Tulare Lake Basin and the work that went into that as well as the recommendations that are coming out of that study.
8342	Stone	Jeff	26	vOdSCzF5aoo	377	398	Like we've seen mostly recently in the stock market, a 2,800 point decrease in the past week. Certainly in 2008, I don't think I would have wanted to have too much in the way of real estate investments being invested with public money. So, we are responsible collectively for ensuring that the public treasury is protected.
8343	Lara	Ricardo	107	X49dPLJib5g	1124	1139	I was thinking in terms of, if the will of the committee is to let this bill move forward, that at a later date we can call it back in during the process to further have the dialogue. I don't know if we can do it before the floor, I mean I don't know.
8344	Hancock	Loni	98	nqU0Ufhmqoo	939	974	I think this is a very innovative model. Obviously, they've done it at Davis and you're trying to encourage it to spread. So, as the bill moves forward, just a thought. If there's a way of including other groups of students, obviously not undocumented, but who may be the first in their families to go to college, who may not have had a number of advantages, I think it would be good because it's a model that can be used in many ways.
8345	Chau	Ed	116	LP2al6_ixVo	116	135	In California we have about 134,000 homeless people living in our streets, parks, alleys, and freeway offramps. We're seeing a decrease in the number of homeowners and an increase in a number of renters. At the same time, vacancy rates are low and rents are increasing.
8346	Hancock	Loni	98	02OHXggJCkA	2013	2042	Okay. Well I think that's the kind of thing that the committee would be interested in. I'm pretty interested, I didn't realize, I thought every single person had a television. Because of sensory deprivation. But if that's not the case would it come under? See these are all positions and costs. So under the $5.6 million for
8347	Linder	Eric	39	bsC6VSsjVLI	884	892	Respectfully asked for your aye vote. Thank you very much to your committee for working with us, and again for all the work that everybody has put into this great bill.
8348	Hancock	Loni	98	R7oFnT2VJUA	614	633	And what we want to know, I think, when these inspections occur is, well, I would very much like to know, do we have a pattern of our findings and inspection times not being corrected?
8349	Hall	Isadore	1	ewcXToh_gOY	1535	1557	With that. So I'm going to lay off of the bill. Hopefully we can come back and later and deal with the bill. I am in support of the clean up program. I'm not in the support, in support of the expansion of sales. I'm gonna have to lay off the bill today. Madame Secretary, please call the roll. The chair is recommending a no vote.
8350	De Leon	Kevin	102	CKAXbjP6mGQ	818	834	Salvador's family expects to save about 75% on their electricity bills in Fresno and on top of that, their homes will be less dependent on electricity powered by the dirty fossil fuels that make it harder for them to breathe.
8351	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	jSYoUQmoG0c	112	135	Housing providers can still perform a criminal background check and, most importantly, ultimately deny an applicant for their criminal history. However, however they should at least judge the qualifications of the applicant to rent an apartment and provide and appli, and provide opportunity for applicants to show proof of rehabilitation.
8352	Cannella	Anthony	61	8GUUuCOIXCY	859	880	I'll be honest, if the UC board offered a plan that really fixed some of the issues associated with the UC system, I would vote to give as much money as we possibly could. Because ultimately, an investment in the UC is an investment in all of our kids and it's an investment in our state.
8353	Daly	Tom	118	bn5R6N5l4NI	270	295	Alright. Are there other persons here to speak in favor of this bill? If not, are there persons here to speak against the bill? Any persons to speak against this bill? Members, we'll go to questions now and I had one just to clarify; we do have the letter signed by the mayor of Oceanside.
8354	De Leon	Kevin	102	Gcdptg51L2I	1835	1853	For this, we owe our Committee staff, both Democrats and Republicans, our deepest gratitude. These hearings provided meaningful results in holding our government agencies accountable and exposing serious lapses in performance that are now being addressed with substantive reforms.
8355	Stone	Mark	20	1l8Sm-QNSvU	862	880	Mr. Chair, Mr. Speaker Emeritus. I'm very happy to be in front of your committee on a policy area that I know you know very, very well. With California under the Supplemental Poverty Measure having poverty rates are approaching 24%, the highest in the nation.
8356	Achadjian	K.H. "Katcho"	5	6G5U2kPEBw0	947	964	My only concern is that retailers are being forced into changes because technology is changing and I'm happy about it because it's a matter of security but we also have got to have a little bit of a consciousness about the retailer's pocket as well. I'm looking towards the small business person.
8357	Pan	Richard	96	Zk_K_zhn8-Q	2176	2193	How do we help transform our healthcare delivery system in a way that's, but realizing they're all connected. I mean that's the part I get a little concerned about is sometimes we talk about budget, we don't think about how it's all connected to other things and how that doing one thing here is going to cause a problem over here even in the same budget. So, thank you.
8358	Hertzberg	Robert	99	UpjsW9YiW28	109	125	this Nike point you make, you know, and we were talking about this and I was getting the briefing from the staff on this, was that these guys are down as much as 30%. We've got this California law that I looked up that was done a long time ago before globalization, you've got a complete contradiction. Somebody was playing games.
8359	Mullin	Kevin	31	m6dFsAKXJbs	1149	1183	Without objection, such shall be the order. Is there any objection to granting Mr. Hadley unanimous consent for reconsideration on Senate Bill 443, Mitchell, for the purposes of sending the measure to the inactive file? Seeing and hearing none, reconsideration is granted. SB 443 is so ordered to the inactive file. Mr. Holden.
8360	Melendez	Melissa	41	2vYcwmo23_E	725	748	Thank you for coming this morning and sharing your thoughts with us on how we could use this technology to improve the relationship between the community and law enforcement because that is very critical. When I hear conversations like from my colleague Assembly Member Alejo whose had five very serious incidents in his small community, that's a great concern to me.
8361	Campos	Nora	76	2v8q2Ohs2X8	110	140	in the Capitol having to fight for their rights to be able to have their education, an education that all Californians should have. That's their right and I think that it is our responsibility as a state, and as individuals, to make sure that we're removing barriers. You know in the area that I live, Silicon Valley, a family that makes $840 a month and $70 for a pass?
8362	Calderon	Ian Charles	115	n57XOOZPs8w	838	853	Not just as a close, but the point of the bill is to get people that are with, that are experts in this area to come together to find solutions to make long-term care insurance affordable.
8363	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	lr5iK8Kvlcs	191	209	But they knew marketing, accounts receivable, payable, they kept inventory in their head, they were some of the most astute businessmen I ever knew, and they all, many of them, ended up in our prison system.
8364	Mitchell	Holly	64	rD0VjcELenc	1678	1701	ACR 31. Senator Galgiani, are you prepared to present this? We'll pass on file.  We'll return to motions and resolutions. This the opportunity to present adjournments in memory, if colleagues have them. Motions and resolutions. Senator Stone.
8365	Leno	Mark	60	alaNgMhEeC8	383	400	So not only have we seen the overall job growth increase since the increase in July 2014 of the minimum wage, but also those forced to accept fewer hours of work or become part time is also clearly not true.
8366	Maienschein	Brian	84	X4Bkp9BrIdE	1253	1281	there was no data to drive the argument, and as to what needed to be done and how best to do it. So we started collecting it. It was an unbelievably difficult process to get agencies that worked on this issue to just come up with data that we could then compile in a way that we could address this problem. Transparency is a good thing.
8367	Rendon	Anthony	120	ROiUoxqGjEc	1295	1312	Proposition one includes $100 million for restoration of the river and it, which is allocated to the river's two conservancies. I expect the Rivers and Mountains Conservancy, which deals with the lower river will use some of their bond funds to pay for it to work to staff the lower LA River Working Group.
8368	Brough	William	111	qyjOsnncZ4w	176	191	First, thank you all for your service, really appreciate what you do for our state. Thank you. I'm an old Cobra mechanic from the army. Could you give me an honest assessment of the State of your aircraft or the need of upgrades? Is there anything you need with your aircraft fleet?
8369	Pan	Richard	96	VbSjp8j5tnU	1174	1189	That would address stepping out conflicts and basically SB 453 allows the treating psychiatrist working with the patient who's incompetent to stand trial, the ability to request another psychiatrist to place an involuntary medication order. And since the bill's been moved, I'll go ahead and let my witnesses make their statements, then. Thank you.
8370	Hill	Jerry	66	mCVaWE-xXHw	342	355	Very good, thank you Ms. Thomas. Others in support? Seeing no one, those in opposition? Thank you. Bringing it back to the committee, we will establish a, yes, sir?
8371	Lara	Ricardo	107	_C-l6C8Fln0	1370	1393	Thank you Madame President and members. SCR5 would have the President Pro Tem of the Senate appoint a special Committee to wait upon his excellency, the Governor, and inform him that the Senate is duly organized for the 2015/2016 regular session and is now ready to receive any communication he may have to make to this house. I urge your aye vote.
8372	Block	Marty	59	HrV-lrSKHCA	605	623	But you can warn prospective patients and ongoing patients about these things. Do you plan to discuss this at a board meeting? Discuss the idea of putting up a sign or some warning more visible, more effective than just "go to a website"?
8373	Alejo	Luis	9	4lx0MqjDD6Q	1807	1823	These are vestiges and symbols of the past the period that was very painful in American history, but there is no reason why in this day and age this state legislature can not act to do the right thing for our future generations. And I'm very proud to co-author and support this bill.
8374	Chiu	David	7	86lIew9ia6A	914	931	Thank you, Mr. Chair. First of all, I wanted to say, I very much appreciate the $5 million that has been proposed in this area. In a past life when I was in local government in San Francisco, I led the charge for our city to authorize the first government funding for legal assistance for undocumented,
8375	Baker	Catharine	74	Jfvd2Tinaec	628	642	Los Angeles, for example, the minimum required is about one percent, and for some small districts it's about five percent. In my own assembly district not far from here just about every school district keeps a reserve of 12 to 14%.
8376	Bates	Pat	58	898OiW72jWg	1323	1349	I think that's still something that's not really clarified. Did we really achieve reduction in staff so that what we currently have is what we really need for the existing jobs that are before Caltrans, or is there some sort of vague unfilled positions that are still being funded where the money could be released for projects?
8377	Grove	Shannon	77	skOoMkG_5XA	1279	1294	Thank you Mr. Chair and members and thank you Mr. Chair specifically for allowing us to go out of order, due to accommodate my witnesses from Washington, D.C. are back east and from Southern California.
8378	Garcia	Cristina	112	ZW0bBeI7WzQ	120	147	Well, to give you a reality, in my district, I only have 30 places in the whole half a million constituents that are 50-plus units. But I have 14,000 that are four units or less. Those are 14,000 that are four units, renters. All disadvantaged community renters. And they pay their own bills, so the landlord has no incentive to take advantage of this.
8379	Pavley	Fran	104	hP3pxZDGmwM	956	965	Ok, it has four votes, it needs one more. It has four, it needs one more. We'll wait for people to add on, it's four to one. Thank you for your presentation.
8380	De Leon	Kevin	102	_C-l6C8Fln0	1610	1629	The red carpet, which is the California State Senate. I do truly mean it. It's not hyperbole when I say this. I say this with great accuracy that this is the best legislative body in the country, bar none. You can't compare the California State Legislature or the California State Senate with any other legislative body, and you surely can't compare with Washington DC because we get things done here.
8381	Holden	Chris	78	CHPaC99Z-AQ	872	890	Thank you and good morning Senators and Chairman. AB 526 increases the penalty for abductions for the purposes of prostitution from $2,000 to $5,000. California Penal Code Section 267 has not been updated for more than 30 years.
8382	Quirk	Bill	23	8s6GBqKeNwE	924	951	Yes, so, as the bill was described by the representative from San Francisco, I wouldn't support it either, but that's not the bill that's before you. The bill before you allows all of the considerations that, that representative discussed, and if there's not a proper reply from the company waiting to install it, they can deny it.
8383	Calderon	Ian Charles	115	q5Jypp4CXc4	784	797	I've been very blessed in my short time in the Legislature; I've been here for two years, ran my campaign when I was 25, elected at 27, now I'm 29.
8384	De Leon	Kevin	102	_C-l6C8Fln0	1629	1669	To emphasize and underscore, once again, italicize and highlight, what we do here on the Senate Floor matters because it helps improve the human condition for all individuals. Democrat, Republican, agnostic, declined to state, it doesn't make a difference. Latino, African-American, White, Asian-American, we're all Californians.
8385	Mitchell	Holly	64	7sM6racHVJs	1549	1582	Everyone in here understands that sugar sweetened beverages contribute to levels of obesity. I don't, as a co-author of the bill, it's not my intention to suggest that it's the only contributor. But when I consider the level of obesity amongst black and Latino girls in South LA, in my district that I see everyday. They're not in your classroom apparently at UC Davis nor are the practitioners who serve them, unfortunately.
8386	Bonta	Rob	85	b_pUZDCcfig	671	679	On balance, I recognize that there are challenging questions and concerns with the potential market impact of this bill. For this reason, I ask you to consider a sunset on the bill.
8387	Fuller	Jean	49	aItBzVMycEU	631	658	What are my families going to do, especially those who will be out of jobs? Especially those who have to drive long distances. The average range of a Tesla is 240 miles and most of us need to drive 500 miles at a time. So, what are we going to do? I beg you.
8388	Hancock	Loni	98	a6D1KFF96cc	396	414	So SB 196 authorizes a county Adult Protective Services agency to file a petition for a protective order on behalf of an elder or dependent an, a, adult in the following narrow circumstances.
8389	Nguyen	Janet	65	bxDlgoZu0KI	1273	1297	The cost of childcare becomes so difficult to manage that families can't even afford to rent a home, let alone be able to consider buying a home. And so, with California's, you know, effort, we need to, I'm hoping that we can help start helping young working families by giving them incentives to stay in the workforce to build their career by passing this.
8390	Leyva	Connie	62	iXqi4cKnhU8	789	806	I agree with Senator Cannella, I was also impressed that you refer to everyone as customers.  I was also impressed that you had both public and private sector experience.  I think that makes you very qualified and I look forward to supporting you today.
8391	Mitchell	Holly	64	gCh9-ng4HsU	119	137	Also, now colleagues in California welfare to work is now 24 months is the maximum amount of time you can receive the benefit. So the benefits we're talking about are already substantially diminished from their 1992 level and a program that is much more prescriptive and is much narrower in focus.
8392	Nielsen	Jim	68	9eA3HqZp1ws	1871	1899	They have a son, Jim, who was a pilot in Vietnam, following the footsteps of his dad, Katy Burlington is their daughter, and she got to see our her mother, the burden that she carried going around family by family when people were lost. A hero and a heroic wife, I would ask that we adjourn in the honor of Eleanor Anderson.
8393	Quirk	Bill	23	7lW2Se-ok-I	121	144	So the topic we're dealing with today is the governor's executive order B-30-15. The Governor has established a new interim greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of 40% below 1990 levels by 2030 and he's ordered the ARB to update its scoping plan to reflect this target.
8394	Garcia	Cristina	112	elq7nOJOh90	506	525	I've been fortunate to stay in touch with him and see him get married, start a business, and raise a family. Here with him today he has his lovely wife Jane, who he married in 2004, his son Caleb who's eight-years-old, his goal is to be the first Asian-American President, his daughter Megan is here as well, she's five-years-old.
8395	Daly	Tom	118	xhI7BgS1JK0	1206	1217	Thank you Mr. Gatto. Ms. Grove has a question or a comment, and then Mr. Cooley. And also Ms. Gaines, I have to go present a bill at Approps, so I'm turning the gavel over to you for a brief time.
8396	Garcia	Eduardo	38	cnM70VeH5ZM	0	10	We'll move on to agenda item 3. We have two speakers.  If our next two speakers would like to come to the table Mr. Mac Taylor and Jerry Nickelsburg.
8397	Brown	Cheryl	13	D-fVk6CkUDE	1456	1473	First of all, this construction will be new construction, as Senator Lara has said. And so, we will have a HOT lane and we will also be able to have the HOV lane as well.
8398	Hernandez	Ed	103	BhpjNxoKRfU	611	620	And I think we need to do everything we can to encourage them to go to those particular areas, and particular, when most of that funding is through the federal government, through the, through Medicare.
8399	Pan	Richard	96	6KgzpeS3bCM	958	971	I'm committed to taking the amendments in the judiciary committee. SB 145 prohibits the hospital from transporting a patient who is deemed medically unstable due to severe intoxication to another location except when the patient is stabilized
8400	Gomez	Jimmy	80	QXW5aikdMmE	1649	1671	AB 337, Jones-Sawyer, tax credit for schools supplies. Hold in committee. AB 405, Brough, increase in interest rate on tax overpayments. Hold in committee. AB 428, Nazarian, tax credits for seismic retrofits, do pass. A roll call. AB 437, Atkins Research and Development grant program for small businesses do pass with minor technical amendments. A role call.
8401	Alejo	Luis	9	gP-mCxG_DCU	746	758	And in much of California management of groundwater reserves that will-- be made easier by identification and quantification of local groundwater rights, the purpose of an adjudication process. But that process is longer and less efficient than it should be.
8402	Hernandez	Ed	103	DJsU22tiuNg	1711	1727	If there's no resolution I would recommend instead of a two year bill, start another bill and have all parties continue this conversation next year in a different vehicle. But at least separate those particular issues, especially when you're dealing an elective procedure.
8403	Hernandez	Ed	103	dCf0VaDDxwk	457	475	Thank you, and I do need to make another apology. I mean this is such a new committee, I'm just learning who's on it. And I apologize, I mentioned you as Vice Chair, it is Senator Morrell who is Vice Chair. And he was Vice Chair when we were on the Health Committee, but then I lost them, and now I have Nguyen, but anyway.
8404	Beall	Jim	92	STE4zvsOeLw	887	900	Okay, we want the people here to, all you have to do right now, we heard the arguments, okay? So, all you have to do is state your name, your affiliation, and your position on the bill.
8405	Gatto	Mike	46	uUsytMtXn1I	1296	1319	You're not really thinking too much about what's going on. And very few people actually read this material is what we've found. It is on page 13 of a 16 page bilingual pamphlet. And it's kind of like you're taking a shelf home from IKEA, you're given the bilingual instructions and trying to recall what's on page 13.
8406	Mitchell	Holly	64	jKwVA2W1KVg	239	262	Thank you very much for bringing that to our attention and coming today. I just want to acknowledge my colleagues on the Committee, the republican staff consultants here, both of them had to travel back to their districts, which are quite a distance, but they were watching on TV to the last-minute, and they have staff who are monitoring today's hearing as well. I wanted you to know that.
8407	Mitchell	Holly	64	L1wK14HX9JQ	163	178	And so my sense is and my hope is that, that will clearer to all of us once the strategic plan is in place. But how do you respond to the concern about the lack of a gender lens.
8408	McGuire	Mike	93	MpQ4SGzO7GE	112	132	You, you're absolutely correct, Senator Leyva. So, this bill is simple. And one of the things that I really appreciate here, we have so many taxpayers here today and very grateful for that. And, all this would do is switch the burden of paying the bed tax off of the homeowner to Airbnb.
8409	Beall	Jim	92	VpwREaswL_E	394	417	when we have homeless people going in and out of our hospital emergency rooms that's not a real solution. When they really need to stabilize their lives and reduce that healthcare cost and provide them with some kind of emergency housing. So I think the waiver should include discussion of that particular issue.
8410	Roth	Richard	106	hYh0N-NJMx0	17	31	My perception is with respect to emergency management and my perception may not be totally accurate is that a lot of the exercises that occur or are local or subregional or maybe even regional, but not statewide.
8411	Roth	Richard	106	hYh0N-NJMx0	2	17	My background, at least in part is in the military. And we tended, at least in the old days to have exercises. And the exercises were not regional or local, they were more national in scope.
8412	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	tTnQ_O5DRYE	297	328	I agree with you that we need to work closely with the chief justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye, and I apologize for another hyphenated last name person, if I put your name. And Martin Hushino. We need to work together with both of them to effect this change because my question is more of, who really is in charge over there at courts.
8413	Leno	Mark	60	r722a4Ml8Ec	142	156	Well then of course, 2008 hit. We weren't to add 212, excuse me, 125 by 2012, we were closer to 90. So, we had lost a full third of our revenue.
8414	Pan	Richard	96	oSf6dq0DzcI	1229	1273	All right, and then I guess for the Auditor, first of all I appreciate the work that the Auditor has done and certainly the issues about access and utilization are very disturbing, the results. But also, I found very disturbing the issue about the fact that they are not conducting the review that they are legally obligated to do. I know that here in my county, Sacramento, we had a report that actually our local First Five Commission had to do. And in the report, even mentioned that as they were asking for information from the department about particular dental plans, the department wasn't even aware that they were missing information from one of the plans.
8415	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	TgDKGcmi03Q	1562	1585	One is the 10% of cap and trade. And I hope that the two billion dollar figure is, fairly accurate, that gives us 200 million a year, at the current, percentage level for the non high speed rail. And then the other is to work in conjunction or, or in partnership as high speed rail is developed.
8416	Stone	Mark	20	Wt_ez7F9UlE	155	174	But arguing for that bill said sometimes peremptory challenges get used against transgender part of our community. And I though well, without respect to changing the number of peremptory challenges, I thought we could fix the issue of discrimination against any part of our community. That's what this bill is.
8417	Block	Marty	59	zWeQ21wOnFU	1650	1668	Thank you to everyone for coming. I just I I'm interested in sort of talking with folks in finance and LAO a little bit about the impact of Proposition to the rainy day fund and how they think it might help on the long-term with relative stability.
8418	Leno	Mark	60	ELlYlrBZUfQ	590	610	Thank you. So, it was agreed upon the closure. As you said, circumstances changed, but then circumstances changed again with the passage of Prop 47. How does that figure into the equation?
8419	Hertzberg	Robert	99	_rncMVWCV9g	375	390	We're going to have an urgency in one thing, we're going to take away money from a bunch of other stuff. Good governments intelligent long-term planning. If you are going to do this, right? You explained this a long time ago, but it's like, okay, you've got a developer, you've got all of the stuff you've got to do with that guy.
8420	Hertzberg	Robert	99	Rj2lrXkjDIw	1707	1723	And so it actually makes it better. And the effect of that has been that most residential installations for families earning between 50 and $75,000 and sub $50,000 grew by 365% between 2007 and 2012 when this happened.
8421	Mitchell	Holly	64	66IpAVpTbHU	964	979	But any comment, wearing my legislative black caucus member hat for a moment, any comment what you what you think? Because it struck me that it was the headline of the article, that she's focusing on the sharp decrease in black students in the system.
8422	Leno	Mark	60	b7XHatlYhkw	519	545	Thank you Madame Chair. Clearly to endorse your statement and as a proud co author of the resolution for all the reasons that have already been described and it would seem this is yet another attempt to change the rules of the game out of concern that they can't play by existing rules.
8423	Alejo	Luis	9	yrj_FS0kMm8	740	756	Thank you and I just wanted to point out some information that you provided us today.  So, that even though $32 billion in water bonds have been  approved since 2000, less than 2% of the total has funded small community drinking water and wastewater projects.
8424	Hall	Isadore	1	H5As3s88-Eg	1263	1282	It's already taking place as we speak. It's already taking place as we speak. It's already allowed, they're already doing it. There is no expansion of gaming, but what it is, in my opinion, is a way for money to get to poor communities. Non-profit organizations that are already struggling.
8425	Allen	Benjamin	70	6HZtMGIcYrk	1646	1658	So let me actually follow up on that and I know we're gonna have our perspectives. You're a Superintendent, you're very proactive. You seem very engaged. You already have a job offer from Orange County.
8426	Leno	Mark	60	R0xKhCYzBZA	437	451	their EIR certification, no CEQA corner will be cut here whatsoever. The projects would not move forward. So for that reason this change has been proposed. We do have a motion, call the roll please.
8427	Pan	Richard	96	GNC2APr9uoc	1393	1409	Thank you. I just want to follow-up with Senator Hernandez's question. Because the children that you presented sound like they were in CCS, was that through the Medi-Cal CCS? Because that would fee-for-service.
8428	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	SQUPcyDaRgg	807	832	Thank you. Mr. Chair and members. Over the past two years, I've brought to this committee two previous, very technical bills that updated, rearranged, and clarified Health and Safety Code, Chapter 6.95 dealing with business plans for hazardous wastes that certified unified program agencies, otherwise known as CUPAS, are charged with overseeing.
8429	Dahle	Brian	47	B7tknBLcV5o	410	426	So that we can then make good policy so that we can lead the world, and we can reduce our carbon footprint. We can have clean energy, and we can take those opportunities that are available to us and put them into play and show how it's supposed to be done. So I appreciate you coming here. I gathered a lot of information.
8430	Stone	Mark	20	v8nsxSPxdAk	351	371	All right then. This was a tough bill when I first read it and I appreciate that you were working with the chair to take the amendments. And the thing that we struggle with as we're moving towards cleaner air standards and GHG reduction is the disparate impact on various communities.
8431	Hertzberg	Robert	99	miQ0Fm1d12I	1228	1243	When you have fundamental change, there'll be people that will be objecting to it. Okay. Once you, we can't take a vote on this, we don't have a quorum yet. Hopefully we can when you present your next bill. Why don't we take out, file a number 15 SB 710, Senator Galgiani.
8432	Bates	Pat	58	162iDtQT3ZE	98	117	His request to personalize the plate, as for Rudy, was denied, and he was told that personalization of the Gold Star family plate isn't allowed by California law. Since 2010, California has issued upon request a specialized license plate for qualified Gold Star family members.
8433	Wieckowski	Bob	55	hkqFcKt5e3k	1421	1446	So just from a technical point of view. We're the legislature. If it becomes state law we need to enact something, in my understanding, versus delegate it to peer review or a third party. Right? We can't do that. So I wanna be sure If there were an acceptable level. Right? We got to get to the first part of the question whether it's an acceptable level.
8434	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	51wXJ30ZLf4	1502	1522	On August 29th, 2013, the United States Department of Justice issued a memorandum, the Cole Memo, that updated its guidance to all US attorneys. In light of state valid initiatives to legalize under state law, the possession of small amount of cannabis, and provide for the regulation of cannabis production, processing and sale.
8435	Gaines	Ted	24	E1_HgghcmCU	1778	1804	Great, thank you for the opportunity and appreciate the testimony today. It's a very tough issue because we have changing technology and a new model that's been presented, and it seems to me that there ought to be some relief for taxi drivers from a regulatory stand point.
8436	Hill	Jerry	66	ChbIO5XT7O8	1127	1141	Youth use of E cigarettes is now higher than youth use of traditional cigarettes. SB24 makes E cigarette retailers subject to the state act, California's premier law to prevent youth access to cigarettes and other tobacco products.
8437	Bates	Pat	58	162iDtQT3ZE	82	98	After serving as a medic for nine months, he was six weeks away from finishing his tour of duty, with hopes of becoming a surgeon. To honor his fallen son, Rudy's proud but heartbroken father, Dante Acosta, sought a Gold Star family license plate.
8438	Stone	Jeff	26	XTEQkJHJtVg	148	170	Second question: you talk about granting exemptions and not granting exemptions, and one of the exemptions is that if there's hydrocarbon in the water, if the total dissolved solids or the salinity of the water is high, but you may not grant an exemption it's if it's economically treatable - that water - to be used for potable reasons, agriculture.
8439	Dababneh	Matthew	50	ocvoub39NwA	110	121	I would love to hear specifically from our panelists from Airbnb, but also if anyone else would like to chime in. Some of the ways you are working with apartment owners and local governments to make sure that you're kind of getting ahead of this issue.
8440	Pan	Richard	96	ITCsXA8Pujs	773	800	And one of the challenges actually in terms of health care is that, I certainly understand the position of insurers, where they're responsible for a year at a time and so short-term savings may seem very appealing when they're not gonna be your responsibility the year after, but this long-term perspective is actually what we need to try to reduce health care costs overall in our country and certainly for our state, so again, thank you so much.
8441	Lara	Ricardo	107	tHDAU5JmwzE	362	378	Five to two that measure passes. Next we have SB 460, reclassification, English language learner's funding, amended to make implementation contingent upon funding in the budget. Will substitute the roll call from SB 254.
8442	Chavez	Rocky	83	GcMV__uVRbo	775	795	Well I know is we've had a lot of little heated discussions of the UC's over funding and I'm looking more from a long term systemic approach. I'm intrigued by the UC Riverside doing the activity based costing, as we've discussed that before.
8443	Hueso	Ben	48	Ydll29eHOng	1304	1321	So as a fixture of Calexico, she will be dearly missed by all those lives that she touched and that community is by far a better place because she had the courage to stand-up and make a difference, thank you for allowing me to adjourn in memory today.
8444	Gatto	Mike	46	N6EhWxD1_nY	289	301	I still, so on a label of something like Windex, you know, it'll disclose that it has ammonia, some kind of dye, you know, green #5, which, you know, I see on Easter eggs.
8445	De Leon	Kevin	102	NPktHkkmjlQ	1530	1549	It has been tough at some time, at times. We have stretched at times. It has not been easy, by no stretch of the imagination. None of this is easy, because if it was easy, then we'd have this done a long time ago. But I can say that we're still working on the technical aspects with regards to the bond.
8446	Bloom	Richard	2	Q7LdbTCujmM	168	182	Before you begin, Ms. Nichols, I think we will take roll. Since we've got four people here, we will strike while the iron is hot and do the vote only calendar.
8447	Wood	Jim	72	yGdC7D9fPQ8	932	947	This affects traditional agriculture as well. DFW are the boots on the ground to try to get to stop this. It is really obvious when you go to an illegal marijuana grow that it is the water's being deluded, excuse me, diverted illegally.
8448	Holden	Chris	78	nGcU-tnoqVY	1571	1598	We have continuously stayed connected with the governor's office to make sure that they understood the types of changes that we were making to be responsive. And, we've even gone beyond many of the concerns he had. So I think that a lot of times, through this process, we can, your bills can die of a thousand nicks.
8449	Nielsen	Jim	68	IKy1yzt0SRs	493	510	And the taxpayers should take note that there are other approaches than this particular one. In one case, it gives a government agent the ability to tax you without representation. Now, let's get over to Senator Beall.
8450	Alejo	Luis	9	toyLEHK5bMU	668	685	25% would get set aside for affordable housing. We no longer have affordable housing fund. 75% would be set aside for economic development to fix a blighted areas. So it was one of the most important tools we had. This Legislature made a decision several years ago but with that with that major change in
8451	Beall	Jim	92	SBp6YDSI70I	2024	2044	That's a different idea nobody's ever put out there. But I thought, why not try to incentivize some of these aspiring counties to pass these sales taxes, because that would be more of an incentive. And you think it would help the voters make their decision?
8452	De Leon	Kevin	102	ofo4g2uUHBA	1348	1358	Sometimes we don't have to act legislatively, there's no need. But the conditions have been created as such that they're not getting the answers that they want, that sense of accountability, transparency.
8453	Allen	Benjamin	70	7zfeQPMxSJ4	276	288	The aquifer must be geographically-isolated and the Board must determine that the injection of the discharged water will not contaminate the source of water that has current or potential future beneficial use.
8454	Pavley	Fran	104	UOAgtw9idpM	1177	1196	Thank you, good luck to you. Senator Stone, I have four bills to present and I want you to behave yourself. The good news is we go to lunch when I'm finished.
8455	Leyva	Connie	62	7aIanLUJ17E	1461	1483	Good afternoon. I have two questions. One, I want to make sure I understand this 60 hour requirement, would that only be for Internet driving schools, or would Internet, and brick and mortar, schools reduce the 2,000 hour requirement for operators down to 60 hours?
8456	Daly	Tom	118	WYVxOJwtXj8	35	56	I tend to, I certainly believe in local control, but in this case, there's been a long, a logjam with the governance of this particular agency. The Fire Authority Board has expanded over time to its current size of 49 total members, 25 primary board members and 24 alternates.
8457	Block	Marty	59	2afEpcU9CME	504	526	SB 559 seeks to remedy this inequity by requiring Imperial Beach to extend 4850 benefits to regular full-time lifeguards. The bill is sponsored by the Service Employees International Union, supported by the California teamsters public affair council, and the mayor of Imperial Beach to show the city's not opposed to this. They recognize that they need to do this for the lifeguards.
8458	Hill	Jerry	66	cvDmVx__4xs	1163	1183	This debate has been going on for over a decade. Airlines and county assessors have been trying to figure out a more efficient system. We've tried filing in each county in the lead county system. These attempts have not achieved the efficiencies and uniformity the legislature envisioned. It's time to establish a one-stop taxing agency system.
8459	Harper	Matthew	14	_NbeI7--ZiA	1497	1512	Any additional wishing to add on in support? Seeing none, any of those that are wishing to speak in opposition? Seeing none wishing to speak in opposition, we'll go ahead and proceed to member's comments, questions or motions.
8460	Hernandez	Roger	37	tJoPe6FpmUg	623	636	Thank you very much. All right at this time, all those wishing to add support as an add-on, at this time you would simply be giving your name, name of organization, and your position on the bill.
8461	Hall	Isadore	1	woVTT_HPcvA	14	26	I would think that there's a general manager or something that could actually sit in the position to help do this now, while we're moving the process forward, or, I mean...
8462	Beall	Jim	92	KRbImOFkOl8	1331	1346	We had to fight to get this information. We got this information and we put this together in a bill, SB 484, which establishes treatment protocols and institutes oversight matters in group homes.
8463	Hertzberg	Robert	99	g1KhSxf2FKA	1830	1853	And what do we do, if in fact, you are fundamentally distinguished because of your ability to get a broader economic feedback effect, because you can tap into other funds, you lessen the impact on the General Fund, so that an enhance, both role of the social and other benefits for this, but change the economic numbers on how we analyze it as a Committee. Please, go ahead.
8464	Hertzberg	Robert	99	X49dPLJib5g	46	55	Well, the order is the court kicks Supreme Court case or court case in San Francisco, says you can't tax those cuz they're just an advertising company well, if the LA Times decides to do a classified, does that apply?
8465	Gatto	Mike	46	mXX7qM53na4	585	616	I want you to imagine for one second that you or your constituents go and get a blood test. So this could be someone in college, who goes to get tested for HIV. This could be somebody who is elderly, and the elderly person goes and gets a test for diabetes, for adult onset diabetes. It could be any of us who goes and gets a test for cholesterol.
8466	Mendoza	Tony	52	E1_HgghcmCU	1087	1103	Which again, a good ... discussion, would please me to, Mr. Chair I keep thinking. What do we, I know that you don't want to take amendments, I'm almost there Mr. Chair, I'm almost done.
8467	Bonta	Rob	85	iF8zLPAheNg	738	758	Bureau of Medical Marijuana Regulation within the Department of Consumer Affairs including the Department of Food and Agriculture and the Department of Public Health, each of which has expertise in various industries that have similarities to that of medical marijuana. It also requires these agencies to propagate appropriate regulations for
8468	Gatto	Mike	46	oWaFMHsMqpI	1123	1139	Sure. So I'll just say quickly that unlike a stick up, unlike a lot of the other crimes that we consider as a legislature, this a crime where the perpetrator has the means and mechanism to get away quickly right there.
8469	Thurmond	Tony	4	xxo2ATBDxJE	2165	2183	Well we are codifying a court decision. And so that is clear. There are, there have been questions, there have been questions, and so since the court decision, we believe that codifying the bill will help to remove any question and provide light and shed light on the action that the court has taken.
8470	Rodriguez	Freddie	69	XZ58s4vcLvc	773	784	And as I stated, we were caught off guard by this proposal to move that property and we never had nobody, never got our input whether it was from my office or her office.
8471	Hertzberg	Robert	99	wxAms1gWFJA	2453	2469	 Thank you Mr. Anthony. Anything further-- just one further question. Have you talked to the rating agencies? If you lift the cap, does this do anything at all to the bond rating agencies? If you're going to pass this issue the bonds, does the cost the money different at all? Have you talk to standard reports Moodys or Fitch?
8472	Hertzberg	Robert	99	DT3707YnrIQ	2003	2015	7-0 that measure is out. File item number 21. 21 by Rendon, AB 1119. Due pass to the floor. Motion by Senator Hernandez. Currently, it's 5-0. Secretary open the roll.
8473	Leno	Mark	60	x_nA6Vz0FIc	371	392	drug administration to become a cessation device but they haven't done that and they're not proposing to do that. And if they do and I encourage them to do so if they are sincere. Clearly, these would be the ones without nicotine, make your case, go to the FDA, and if you become a cessation device, this bill, as written,
8474	McGuire	Mike	93	woVTT_HPcvA	504	519	SB 685 is a bipartisan proposal, that will allow veterans service organizations to host the general public, when holding events that serve alcohol, at their organization's establishment. This would be focused on beer and wine.
8475	Hernandez	Ed	103	HU5u3bnal2k	61	76	the state is going to lead to the success of its act in this country. But along with that comes, we've had some problems obviously with medical enrollment, trying to get everybody into it, you know. We're working on the glitches with Covered California. But one of the
8476	Alejo	Luis	9	Qd8yv7EufE4	64	79	This sign has helped remind millions of motorists every day, that they need to do their part in terms of water conservation. Let's make a cost effective, efficient, innovative use of our existing infrastructure, to remind voters to also do their part on election day, and to register to vote.
8477	Kim	Young	82	ullCtaxzBRw	845	866	I mean there's a lot of ripple effect that benefit us and it thing Ms. Brown your concern maybe you maybe alluded to that a little bit maybe. Are we bringing foreign employees or jobs that are replacing the current jobs that may be available to our Californians.
8478	Hill	Jerry	66	ZJAG2StITgQ	1619	1643	So, that's for tax purposes and then you've got for workers comp purposes. But, your issues are the licensing and consumer protection of the work of the contractor whether licensed or not license. So it sounds like your efforts with Social Security numbers are to enhance the efforts of EDD and the Franchise Tax Board, rather than the efforts of what you're charged for.
8479	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	E7Xx3wrypds	1250	1266	We don't need to keep building more and more freeways. We have not built ourselves out of this,built freeways out of this problem. And I'd just like to thank you for being here today, all of you, and we're gonna have another committee hearing, hopefully in the Fall.
8480	Bloom	Richard	2	w6A3dw8D_mc	1898	1920	And I'll just, by way of example, under the Coastal Act, the coastal commission staff has the ability where there is an emergency like an earthquake or a landslide, to act, to fill the breach when the emergency occurs.
8481	De Leon	Kevin	102	85T-CDj8RB4	782	805	Thank you Mr. Chair, and I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisles for a very robust discussion with regards to SB 350. I want to go back to a couple points, and perhaps I will help educate Mr. Hernandez on a couple points that I think are absolutely very critical. Because there's a theme here that I think is right on target.
8482	Alejo	Luis	9	gnd2v7Ro_Uo	722	737	Well, first of all Mr. Chairman, I think the arguments have been the same last three years. Simply from our point of view are unfounded. Because this tool, one of two things. One it's geared to help the most disadvantaged communities, those communities that are struggling the most.
8483	Hernandez	Roger	37	VFoe5hvDs-o	1019	1040	Stating that continuing education is essential in enhancing fair, effective, and efficient administration of justice. This rule requires the CSR to complete eight hours of continuing education every two years. However, this requirement does not specifically require the continuing education course to be in the area that is relevant to the core employee's profession.
8484	Wood	Jim	72	b4gDbT98z6E	1960	1970	And so in the past how has that been dealt with when someone has simply walked away and left their responsibilities, what has happened in the past in those cases?
8485	Mitchell	Holly	64	rn8iMdWxrk0	197	221	Again, I said to you that the Attorney General reports on the amount of money through the equitable sharing federal law loophole that California law enforcement organizations collect. And again, between 2000 and 2008, $305 million was seized.
8486	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	WsNNww2cgqU	1568	1582	Yes and Senator Glazer, I'm trying to get this worthy goal done. I don't want the bureaucracy to weigh it down. So, as a former bureaucrat, I'm dedicated to ensuring that that doesn't happen.
8487	Allen	Benjamin	70	kbDiQqGDHBM	915	943	Board during its regulatory process, the bill also was narrowed to clarify which permits the department will require prior to deeming a section dredge permit complete. Other amendments were technical and suggested by the administration. This bill is supported by leading environmental groups, Native American tribes, The Indian Gaming Association, Pacific Coast Federation of Fly Fishing, Association Water Agencies including the MWD in the East Bay MUD, because of its commitment to water quality. I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
8488	Garcia	Cristina	112	hb1VvxrKGQE	75	91	75% of parents still turn their children forward facing too early. A child is 75% less likely or face severe injuries if they are facing to the rear of the vehicle. This bill has exceptions for weight and height based on the CDC growth curves for children.
8489	Allen	Benjamin	70	_2SQeKV98e0	1013	1030	Do you see-- and the panels can answer this as well. But you know, obviously, the 2008 election in particular, but also 2012 to a lesser extent was of universally recognizes an extraordinary moment of youth outreach in turnout, both because of presidential election.
8490	Eggman	Susan Talamantes	73	O1x83dZ-ZdA	251	274	And we'll continue to do so as we go to the floor. So today I present ABX215 which is the end of life option act. That is meant to provide those with a terminal illness an opportunity to end their life in a dignified manner. And while this says dignified manner, I'd like to say during my long years working in end of life,
8491	Jones	Brian	42	9NVb2cnRnt4	429	452	And one of the most frustrating things of being a legislator here was the chair of the subcommittee and myself worked very diligently to make sure that we got to some votes on that subcommittee that were 5-0 with bipartisan support on lots of issues that were important to the legislature and to Californians.
8492	Wilk	Scott	19	h-QyikgWJeU	312	328	He grew up work as a lifeguard, and in fact set a record. He saved 79 lives as a lifeguard. Many those were young women so I think, you know, they may not have been all that serious, but it's official tally of 79. From there, obviously, we all know he was a broadcaster.
8493	Pan	Richard	96	n_QC4AsmdBs	137	147	Thank you. Thanks so much, Chair Bonta, and committee members, and all the panelists who are here today, as well as all the parties that are interested in this hearing and the important topics that are on today's agenda.
8494	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	OVIQdDmHNzI	302	322	And again, on July 1, 2018 on the status of their implementation so we can keep track of how this is going. We all know that IT in the state of California has been an embarrassment. That, to get things online, to get them so that there is that transparency, has been one debacle after another. We have talked with OPR.
8495	Thurmond	Tony	4	NYGfzZLGLck	1914	1931	Thank you Madam Chair, and thank you Senator. I know that this bill simply is asking for codification. And saying the defense attorney should be informing the person before the court that there are many consequences including deportation.
8496	De Leon	Kevin	102	P8iQl0Ig1eQ	158	178	Now, again, these are cases that have been adjudicated, and 83% who actually have won their claim against the employer for wage theft never see a dime. The wage theft problem is compounded by our economy which increasingly relies on low wage service sector jobs workers for temporary work.
8497	Runner	Sharon	4656	pN6JjHAiSWs	1119	1158	Well, thank you, young man, for sharing your story. And all the parents out there, and grandparents, and students who testified in support of the bill. I see this as very important, like Senator Pan, that we have to get the kids early. And the teachers need to know how to identify that early. So I don't see it as leaning on the psychologists to do this, I see it more teachers trained to identify this issue, and for that I support the bill, I move the bill.
8498	Weber	Shirley	44	xusZRk9gg60	1733	1750	So, we will continue to work on this. This is still very important. It's not an unimportant item, not only for the assembly but we think, for the state, in terms of securing and providing safety for those that are there. So we accept the compromise of dealing only with the brace and bolts for the next two years.
8499	McCarty	Kevin	22	JsdLHusMjfo	47	68	And I want to thank them for taking their time either busy schedules to viewer here did you with us this morning and also the Subcommittee is going to be getting into the Governor's proposals related to LCFF implementation, but on school facilities and Prop 39 energy efficiency projects.
8500	Fuller	Jean	49	7E5hMfSVPig	1012	1027	I appreciate the time you spent with me and others, and I think everybody's covered this subject pretty well, and obviously their districts are closer to the problem. So, I will just echo Senator Leyva's comments about transparency.
8501	Leno	Mark	60	aagt3kLsyTc	772	809	You'd have to be earning over $350,000 a year to be slapped with an additional $4,000. A person earning $30,000 a year might be impacted by about $100 a year. So, it's modest. But the benefit that will be provided as a result of that increase.  I think most workers, as represented by Cal Labor Fed here today, would say that's a pretty good deal, so I'm happy to support the bill today.
8502	Irwin	Jacqui	16	kLTY4thtXsA	1500	1519	Mister Chair and members, a couple of things I would like to point out that weren't included in the analysis. Because the provisions of this bill are included in the state administrative manual, state agencies are already funded to comply with these requirements. This simply insures that important security practices are prioritized.
8503	De Leon	Kevin	102	LhZTpLi6UbE	1073	1100	I'm so sorry, you said, you note, made reference to the seventies and how a certain burn or maybe a few days but now it's dramatically different fast forward, you know, twenty five, thirty, thirty five years, what are the attributal factors other than the ones I perhaps articulated a  few moments ago with my line of questioning to these much more massive, you know, longer burns that has just more fuels in vegetation?
8504	Block	Marty	59	RChcWpGW4gA	40	65	Sure, thank you. Mr. Chair, members, today I'm presenting SB538, which authorizes naturopathic doctors to independently prescribe a very limited number of medications. As your analysis indicates, the costs of the bill are minor, and absorbable. And will be paid for by the Naturopathic Medical Committee, which is funded solely by licensing fees of naturopathic doctors.
8505	Stone	Mark	20	ES_o9sm3ARk	956	975	But these are the steps, the planning tools necessary in working with local governments to be able to address infrastructure changes, protection of wetlands, estuaries, and natural buffer systems that preserve our watersheds and important species. So, I appreciate you bringing this forward. I would like to be added as a co-author if I may.
8506	Block	Marty	59	CyJMVxFxLck	195	222	 Okay moving to item 16 which is the last item on Agenda Part B. Then we go back to Agenda Part A. Item 16 will have Department of Finance begin. Full house for this one.
8507	Hertzberg	Robert	99	Zz925hDmty8	1015	1035	And in my view, there's a real risk in terms of the larger tax picture on what you're gonna do when you now have another listed tax on a ballot. Now maybe people will vote for that in Alameda County. I'm not knowledgeable enough to know. I just think you gotta weigh that as coming in with this urgent one time decision, and I think you've got other options in that play.
8508	Mitchell	Holly	64	HgBIr1hupMw	942	962	...comment because I wanted to say it before Ms. Chu presents the report that, as I shared with her previously is one of the best summary documents of a highly complex multifaceted, multi funding stream program.
8509	Gomez	Jimmy	80	1NZUtvyVKUY	23	38	Thank you, chair members. Today, I'm presenting 757, which will authorize a medical assistant who meets specified criteria to perform a total protein refractometer test analysis in a licensed plasma collection facility in California.
8510	Bloom	Richard	2	C5FKcnZ9gio	1035	1060	It hasn't gotten any more complicated for the industry. It has only gotten easier to provide the service that they provide as individuals. So this is not gonna have an impact on small businesses, as has been claimed. This is something that is simple to apply whatever county you might be in and I ask for your aye vote. Thank you.
8511	Block	Marty	59	iJn9H0iEehM	845	862	If that doesn't happen, I'd suggest that for the record, those of us who may serve on Budget Committee beat the Governor to blue penciling any funding for the Bureau next year. So let's please keep us advised of what's the progress they make.
8512	Hueso	Ben	48	PLWNz_3ZqZQ	0	25	Thank you Mr. Chair and Senators. SB189 would create the committee on maximizing jobs and economic growth. This committee, which will consist of experts in the fields of economics, finance and policy, will advise state agencies tasked with implementing greenhouse gas emission reduction and energy efficient policies.
8513	Gipson	Mike	28	aX3hcacca8I	666	681	If the woman would come in here, in this room today, and sit right next to me, there's not anything that anyone can do to prosecute that woman for taking our child away from us. Every birthday, every Christmas, we go to a cemetery.
8514	De Leon	Kevin	102	SU8_KAMcIaE	858	886	There we go. I appreciate Miss Mitchell's question because I'm looking at the make-up of your colleagues and your peers in the pollution control district and you're the only one, I'm going to make this assumption, who is a Phd and as the ED of the Central Valley Health Policy Institute obviously you have a different perspective.
8515	Gatto	Mike	46	UdyJhNk-vh8	1	16	Alrighty, folks, this is the April 30, 2015 hearing of the assembly committee on consumer protection and privacy. We do have a quorum present, so, madame secretary let's establish it.
8516	Pan	Richard	96	7GZ072NI9Sk	1403	1420	Or the physical structure, is it stable? Or other types of issues in terms of drills and so forth, and I think we have both a strength and a weakness that we are able to end disasters.
8517	Grove	Shannon	77	rDGVmGQNitA	403	448	So if there's a county under contract with the state the standard reimbursement would be $752 regardless if it cost them $500 a month or $600 a month or more in different counties. That's right. So one of the comments that was just made that minimum wage increase has cost providers to actually pay more, my colleague from Richmond asked you to think about a special formula or whatever to move forward to where we should be in 20 years, 10 years. He said 20, but 5, 10, 20 years if they're successful in unionizing child care and the cost increases, goes up. Can you guys throw in the number that you think those numbers might be to the state if that was to happen? Or do you anticipate the state being exempted from that?
8518	Pavley	Fran	104	3ZbkIQK-LEk	1948	1981	And maybe I can sort of lead forward the close by the author, any comments sort of, it's on the one hand and the other hand kind of a weighing. I was, had the privilege of being around for the DD Albert [assumed spelling] bill. I think Senator Hertzberg and I both as assembly members were. That was very long and that didn't pass and this bill is trying to extend the timeline from a prior bill that was approved by the legislature.
8519	Eggman	Susan Talamantes	73	mEidzFiLEmY	1140	1156	Thank you, Mr. Chair members. AB 601 is a consumer protection bill that will provide more transparency of residential care facilities for the elderly known as RCFEs and i thank you in advance for your aye vote.
8520	Lara	Ricardo	107	qTf-RqJKEFo	1093	1105	Many of those funds include thirty million dollars direct allocation for watershed improvements, and a share of one hundred million for urban creek restorations will be allocated through the RMC.
8521	Gomez	Jimmy	80	Y_pbsK-_qw0	484	506	Right? We had no specific tax exemption for that program, but when you actually look at it, people were on the hook as a tax liability. So what we ended up doing is we had to create an exemption for that program. So we often have to balance values, right? The need to appropriately tax individuals but then to make sure that the taxes don't
8522	Hernandez	Ed	103	7CixOREAkbE	1677	1690	Having a capitated system, they can be more efficient, bless you, they can be more efficient. They come in, not only see them that day, they can see that same patient for a different problem that same day as well, and make sure that that patient is taken care of.
8523	Hernandez	Ed	103	Zz925hDmty8	52	75	So the health district that was approved by the voters I'm assuming it's charter it's constitution, it's got a board of directors that are elected. An elected board of directors. So it owns assets which are property, it's rental to physician offices to provide healthcare services, but does not currently in this area have a hospital. Is that correct?
8524	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	a6D1KFF96cc	1678	1693	5-2, that bill is out. Thank you, very much Senator Pan. Now let's go back to file item five, unless there is anybody else you would like to score some points with Senator Waite, so that you'd like to move ahead of you.
8525	Dababneh	Matthew	50	6FS_MTpGrZk	771	836	Thank you so much actually Mr. Morrell asked several questions that I had my mind including consumer motivation and the default rate and I appreciate those answers. What I did take of this discussion is I think to me at least an inner weaving of causation and, really the symptoms of really a bigger issue, which is social economic inequality and I think, you know, it's often I think we're having conversations this industry gets painted as industry that created the issue with impoverished men or indebtedness, it seems like when you talk about these extreme examples of someone that's homeless living in a car and then they get paid day loan or they get in this case a title loan, and that person clearly should not get a title loan, but that is not the reason that person was living in a car either and, I do find it somewhat of a dangerous comment to say that there's never been a pay day loan or a title loan that has done someone a benefit.
8526	Nielsen	Jim	68	fPXDsUW3HWg	688	702	Somebody has to make the determination that this doesn't happen. You know, droughts are force de majeure anyway. But we're not going to be expecting God to tell us that the drought is over because it's started to rain. That's, it's to my point, okay?
8527	Weber	Shirley	44	jRDlxywi7uQ	1449	1465	I assume there's some individuals in the audience who are in favor of the bill. We will hear from them now. We're asking those who would like to make a statement in favor, please line up. You can give us your name, your organization, and whether you're for or against the bill.
8528	Hueso	Ben	48	w3XqiN30Dys	1980	1994	It was controversial. It was taken over in fact, you know, looking up that webpage my father was listed as one of the people that were involved in taking over that park. I'm very proud of that. That's kind of the inheritance that he left me in our community, that park. That was taken over by people in the community.
8529	Campos	Nora	76	8g5e-OGL0_Y	455	490	Thank you Mr. Speaker and members. I am honored to welcome a distinguished group of individuals to the Assembly chambers today. With us in the rear of the chambers are the Council Generals of Canada in California Mr. Villanova, the Canadian Council General in Los Angeles, Ms. Casey Doyle, the Canadian Council General in San Francisco, and they are accompanied by royal Canadian mounted police
8530	Hertzberg	Robert	99	wHx-nZg7Thw	844	861	In other words, the basic thing of modernizing creative management ways to really come up with putting kids in school and giving them a leg up, are out there in a big way, and we're sitting on our tuchus, doing nothing about it.  I gotta reintroduce my Yiddish dictionary again.
8531	Hueso	Ben	48	-bJq_JGSuxY	1002	1018	Thank you. And when we have a quorum, I'll ask for your bill to be moved. Thank you very much, great presentation. We're gonna hear from, we have Assemblymember in the room, Assemblymember Bloom on AB 1330.
8532	Campos	Nora	76	8g5e-OGL0_Y	490	531	Corporal Eric Shepherd and other counselors staff. Canada is a great friend and partner of California and has a real impact in our state. Over 1 million canadians live and work here. More than 2 million visit every year and we export many goods and services to Canada, our second-largest market after Mexico and our bilateral trade is $45.1 billion. On a personal note I am pleased that in my district in the City of San Jose is
8533	Hernandez	Ed	103	6rfjyYYx2nU	169	182	However, I'm open to including protections in this bill, and I'm committed to working with the physician community should this bill move forward on what those protections should look like. And with that, Madam Chair, Members, I respectfully ask for an aye vote.
8534	Nielsen	Jim	68	qvwEtfRitEI	1723	1736	They're going off the state budget and levying incredible fines upon the citizens of California. I think there are other ways to address this. There's nothing in this bill that goes after the real offenders, the poachers.
8535	Pavley	Fran	104	4mB1nCFXohc	275	289	Yeah, and that some people live in areas that may not have a lot of air pollution so that threw them out, because if you live, let's say in San Francisco, you have that wind that blows everything into the Central Valley, so you excluded yourself.
8536	Bonilla	Susan	3	23L8yaBtAnI	662	677	I support this bill and I just encourage of you who believe in family values to consider supporting this bill. That's really what it's about. This is the one holiday in the year really given to families to get-together.
8537	Brown	Cheryl	13	UrwGLPEFGk4	502	521	We have a trucking economy in the Inland Empire and what we find is happening is that with the retrofit of the  new trucks and so forth, retrofit of the trucks for CARB, everything is if you have five trucks or more.
8538	Pavley	Fran	104	FapiTOGMI3c	174	192	It makes several changes to inspections. It allows lead agency employees to inspect surface mining operations. Individuals could come from local government, or they could hire someone as a consultant through the private sector. Just requires that there's training in place.
8539	Lackey	Tom	10	u8oZZTgP2Tw	406	425	If the Estrada case established that they are only volunteers AB 1443 still left reserve peace officers vulnerable to discrimination. They are considered to be employees by the California workers' compensation law, California government claims act, and the California Commission of peace officers standards and training.
8540	Bonta	Rob	85	0hkCdiDRiI0	1674	1684	The current count is four to six, the bill will be on call. Thank you assembly member Chau. Next to see Assembly Member Gaudo here we have item number three, AB 170.
8541	Williams	Das	12	WR_bP6j3vkM	2	31	Lacking a quorum for the assembly Natural Resources Committee. Lacking a quorum for the assembly Natural Resources Committee we will meet as a subcommittee and we will begin with Assemblywoman Bonilla. Item eight?
8542	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	3bQ_hUBlpio	693	710	And so it is my great pleasure to bring to this floor Marina Inserra. She is a graduate of Hilltop high school in Chula Vista. The first Miss California to come from the 80th Assembly district. Quite proud of that. And she has represented California well by promoting tourism.
8543	Chiu	David	7	7KrRcZ9ORsY	1379	1389	I think I would disagree with the premise of what you're suggesting. The clinics that we're talking about do provide the full range, in fact I'd be happy to defer to one of our witnesses today to talk about that.
8544	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	3bQ_hUBlpio	670	693	Thank you Mr speaker and members. Today I'm very excited to introduce the most famous member of our district this year. The Miss California program is a part of the Miss America program, the oldest and most prestigious scholarship program for young women in this country. Who have paid for countless women to go to college, graduate school, and law school.
8545	Levine	Marc	8	xrAeErxMDIY	909	927	Thank you sir, thank you members. AB 498 establishes a statewide policy to promote the protection of wildlife quarters, and other habitat linkages. In order to enhance the resiliency of wildlife and their habitats to climate change, protect biodiversity and allow for migration of species between blocks of habitat.
8546	Hernandez	Ed	103	LwhIfxRQ9VM	891	917	So my offer to him at the time was, if there's anything I can do, because this is obviously a health issue dealing with a very vulnerable population that we serve in the State of California. So when I look at our healthcare system and what's going on with the Affordable Care Act with regard to this massive shock to the system that we've had from increasing the number of individuals in Cover California.
8547	Quirk	Bill	23	n1fwEe95aOQ	202	221	We've also, there were some concerns raised about the state wide marketing administrator being responsible for coordinating this new outreach and incentive program and if the committee is amenable, I propose striking that language as well.
8548	Bloom	Richard	2	24W2oeMkjbI	1331	1347	It's a lengthy letter, I only got it yesterday, I can say this is as a, as a former mediator. In the court system in Los Angeles county, the mediation program there, and I, presume by extension, across the state of California,
8549	Baker	Catharine	74	qCEr8jDp5Hg	1026	1035	And I think this is something we should be doing at the state of California. Right now, there is no deduction for what Californians contribute to a Coverdell Education Savings Account.
8550	Eggman	Susan Talamantes	73	TPSat3Z_tD4	1324	1342	transgender people have experienced sexual assault in their lifetime. Civil code fifty two-point-four was originally enacted in two thousand two by then assemblymember Hannah-Beth Jackson as a means to curb violence and sexual assault against women. However it is unclear whether this protection extends to transgender women.
8551	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	dWQgHfO0lk4	1777	1789	And I apologize for being late. There are so many other things happening. I don't know if you mention the whole issue of emerging bacteria and unknown diseases. I know when we held a hearing on emergency preparedness that issue came up as the ocean temperatures increase and all these adjustments are made through the climate.
8552	De Leon	Kevin	102	Ydll29eHOng	543	569	Thank you madame president. Colleagues, this will be our last group of appointments before this Senate Floor. We have three, Mr Arnaldo Avaloz, Mr. Tom Epstein as well as Nancy Sumner. Mr Avaloz is the founder and CEO of the Avaloz foundation, which provides scholarships to low-income high school students from the upper Sacramento valley who are attending the University of California
8553	Levine	Marc	8	B5S6WSG3Bcc	295	322	Any other questions for Ms. Hanak? No? Alright, I just want to say thank you very much for this presentation. You are much more than just a warm-up act and there are two take ways that I really had. First was, of course, that we're not investing as much as we need to. And as we spend down these bond dollars, which we must do it, and we need to do it. We will have a larger funding gap.
8554	Gatto	Mike	46	kAZMIWno7zI	712	729	And it was that gentleman's opinion that we do pretty good in the government. We do pretty well to regulate citizen to citizen privacy issues, but we could do a lot more with the government to citizen privacy issues. and that's another issue that I think we'll take on this year. so sting ray technology does anyone wish to weigh in?
8555	Pan	Richard	96	u9WQRBoV7yg	1026	1051	So again, I urge support for this resolution as a commitment from all of us, no matter what where we come from or our party or wherever, else to open government and an appreciation of the ideals of that and our efforts to achieve that, both our leadership and our desire to continue to be leaders in open government and being open-to-the-public. Thank you very much and I respectfully ask for an aye vote.
8556	Roth	Richard	106	SCWpb6PxRGE	256	271	And that is the beginning and the end of the provision that is, has unfortunately been labeled a minor matter provision. I prefer to call it a technical but important violation. I hope that addressed your questions, Madam Chair.
8557	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	9BeGgNFnShg	1775	1795	That's horrifying story. Which is hard to believe in Berkeley High, in I guess I shouldn't say of all places, but I guess this goes on throughout the state. My question isn't so much they need training. Why isn't there any enforcement? Why aren't there any consequences to this behavior?
8558	Alejo	Luis	9	CRMwg6_WO3E	1037	1047	Under existing state, DTSC can ask for information related to hazardous materials and waste but it cannot request information about a party's finances which could demonstrate the party's ability to pay clean-up cost.
8559	Chiu	David	7	NNzDQCiG5UU	2212	2232	Thank you, Mr. Speaker and colleagues. I'd like to introduce a guest, my first guest actually in this chamber, who was just recognized a few minutes ago in our state Senate. Tomorrow, January 30th is Fred Korematsu Day of civil liberties and the constitution in the State of California.
8560	Mitchell	Holly	64	11yyICoQ5m8	15	31	And then I'm always amused by that personally and professionally, as an employer of a 500 employee organization, my first employee who took advantage of paid family leave when it became law, was a man who's wife had twins who were medically fragile.
8561	McGuire	Mike	93	KyjcaFzffNo	1695	1721	Coastal communities contributed $40 billion annually to our state's economy and provide nearly a half-million important jobs. SB 788, the California coast protection act, seeks protect our coast economy by repealing a loophole that was embedded into legislation that was brought forward in 1994 to permanently ban offshore oil and gas drilling off of our great coast.
8562	Bonilla	Susan	3	yLYXPq0fwvY	239	253	If this bill doesn't work and we pass something else, how is the transition going to happen? You're going to need a period of time whether you call it safe harbor or transition to work this out.
8563	Bates	Pat	58	u9WQRBoV7yg	1727	1748	Even when you disagreed with her on an issue, it was hard not to like her. An active member of her community, she was active in her kids' schools, coached soccer and played tennis and volleyball. Kathleen's life changed forever in 1981 when the car she and her family were driving hit black ice and collided with a truck.
8564	Bates	Pat	58	u9WQRBoV7yg	1748	1761	The accident tragically killed Cameron, her 12 year-old daughter and actually required Kathleen to be on medication for the rest of her life. Kathleen spent seven months in the hospital recovering before returning home.
8565	Grove	Shannon	77	uSmu0VlTZFk	134	147	The Department of Public Health documents have illuminated numerous cases of abuse, rape, 13 deaths have been occurred since this document was produced because of neglect and the lack of supervision within the DCs.
8566	Bates	Pat	58	u9WQRBoV7yg	1690	1713	Thank you Mr President. I, too, rise and ask that we adjourn in the memory of Kathleen Blackburn, a former mayor of the City of Laguna Beach. Kathleen was 71 years-old when she passed away on March 16th after complications from a decades old car accident. She served on the City Council from 1992 to 2000 where she served twice as mayor
8567	Gaines	Beth	109	0pvN33z5LJg	301	319	The auditor also mentioned in her report that because the branch does not have a formal process, nor the staff, to search for diabetes related grants, she recommends that a single, single, one single staff position be created to compete for more grant opportunities.
8568	Bonta	Rob	85	qMylnhtxSF8	690	706	All right. Let me just jump in here. We talked about narrow tailoring earlier, and I want to ask you to narrowly tailor your responses to the questions of the members. Answer their question. And then stop and see if they have another question. And we'll move through the member questions and get on to public comment. Dr. Wood, do you have any more questions?
8569	Quirk	Bill	23	7f5uDPxTBXo	234	249	All right, let's see witness is an opposition. All right there being no witnesses in opposition, do we have questions or comments from the Committee? All right you may close.
8570	Grove	Shannon	77	maPB0VHfdFQ	1198	1218	These bills right here that we're passing today allow secrecy to take place, and the language will be inserted the last day of the last moment of the last hour that we get to vote on this at the end of June. The thing is that we need to stand-up and recognize transparency in governments and making sure that our government operates for the people.
8571	Pavley	Fran	104	RM5OAEIHO1U	1045	1061	 Because I was curious how the money was being expended and what the results were on that one so if we don;t have that information now, maybe you could get that to me, hopefully by tomorrow, if possible.
8572	Harper	Matthew	14	23L8yaBtAnI	351	380	Thank you very much Mr Speaker. This bill is yet another overreach of government into the business of business affairs of Californians. Honestly, this bill seeks to gobble up the bottom line of so many businesses. This should be a decision between employee and employer, not another mandate from the State of California. I would urge my colleagues to vote against this turkey of a bill.
8573	Pan	Richard	96	2aV-8k1n6pw	339	353	In terms of the quality measures, I know that I worked with Director Douglas, and we need to have dashboards, we need to have quality measures. We need to look at access measures. We need to make that more transparent.
8574	Leno	Mark	60	IO307YMxf6Q	1636	1650	Thank you. In full support of the bill for all the reasons stated and the compelling testimony that we have heard. Can you please help me? The first woman who testified, she's been with us in this committee hearing before. Always articulate. I should know her name.
8575	Block	Marty	59	r722a4Ml8Ec	1258	1272	Having said that I do value Hastings Law School and I do understand the need for the support that they've requested and I will move that we approve this request.
8576	Pan	Richard	96	2aV-8k1n6pw	288	311	So that makes me a little uncomfortable, and I think some of my colleagues as well, that, what's going on in the department? Who's watching the shop? Is it only when people are looking and then when we stop looking, we just, but being that, we know we're hearing from our patients. You know, I'm Medi-Cal provider, so for patients, our constituents, that they're having trouble getting care.
8577	Hertzberg	Robert	99	iTrvWXqiedk	2348	2372	but what's clear, what we cleared, is that there is a way, when you search, on seven stop signs, when you have 25,000 tickets and you're in the middle of a park in the middle of nowhere, there has to be a better way to serve public safety. We're not being successful. The reason why it raises the question that this is about revenue and not about safety.
8578	Hueso	Ben	48	2afEpcU9CME	1583	1600	But in the meantime, we get to honor a woman. Never in the history of California have we honored the presence of a woman in Washington as somebody that has contributed something of importance to this state. I think that is an enormous change.
8579	Liu	Carol	63	BhpjNxoKRfU	1306	1323	Beginning now to develop and implement a state long-term care plan with goals, strategies, benchmarks and deadlines will enable California to meet the needs of its growing, aging population and people with disabilities in a rational manner, rather than response in a crisis mode.
8580	De Leon	Kevin	102	SU8_KAMcIaE	973	991	I appreciate your answer that there's a balance. I'm not quite sure if there's a balance, I think there's an imbalance with the disproportionate amount of air pollution that your children suffer from.  I think there's an imbalance what the incredible high unemployment rate in your geographical area that you govern, that you govern through the pollution control district.
8581	Hueso	Ben	48	2afEpcU9CME	1530	1550	I think I'm going to work with the author and with the catholic community to see if we can locate the statue at different places in the state. It won't happen for several years from now from the time that the new statue is commissioned and placed. That's going to happen in maybe 3 years, maybe more.
8582	Beall	Jim	92	gB0SqdP0x6o	1620	1630	Alright, and you would cover every shift of employees and any other times your employees come and go from the facilities. The employees come and go in uniform shifts or the shifts stagger throughout the day?
8583	Liu	Carol	63	xL36G7ytN6U	172	192	Thank you Madame President. Members, this is a two-thirds bill. SB 114 and advances they K-12 public education facilities bond act of 2016. It currently designates an unspecified amount of general obligation bonds for school facilities
8584	Hernandez	Roger	37	85T-CDj8RB4	422	444	that there's got to be something that's been cued inside of you when you hear so many Democrats and just about every Republican saying there's a problem with forfeiting so much legislative power. And legislative to me, I believe it to mean policing, oversight, and being the ones that make the law. Not oversight, not CARB.
8585	Pan	Richard	96	BQgV9eqQ2Tw	1230	1243	And if it's been set up that way, which is what the Chief Data Officer by setting the standards will do, then it becomes much more available. We don't want a bunch of fragmented data systems that make it more difficult for people to tap into it.
8586	Mitchell	Holly	64	ew8AvQDfJuQ	361	377	 Thank you.Thank you very much. Any other questions on this panel? We'll move on to the final 7H, Trailer Bill, Childcare Law Center, Anna Levine, with the law center.
8587	Bates	Pat	58	ImdbglqlDDQ	1785	1801	Excuse me, it would seem with the establishment of this new stakeholder group and more response to the constituents that you are on your way to accomplishing what your bill does.
8588	Block	Marty	59	dsDmjvJ4L6g	1003	1013	Thank you Miss Chu. Now, we do have a panel of providers, will be coming up shortly for kind of specific examples of what is happening, with questions for Ms. Chu. Senator Monning.
8589	Nielsen	Jim	68	TbimRTTdSU4	1322	1346	Well he's suggesting that the, and I thought that was the intent, that it further clarifies what we already have in the bill. Now the confusion with some of the other verbage that has been cited here, and you say exists in the history of the bill, Assemblyman, those words kind of crept in if you will.
8590	Hertzberg	Robert	99	1l8Sm-QNSvU	1778	1790	Yeah my estimate is 1.6 billion, our analysis says $2 billion probably then would cost, but it's the right thing to do. So do you wanna say anything to close, Mr. Chairman?
8591	Campos	Nora	76	ZDCiwfvu_KE	39	56	Since teachers do not have access to the State Disability Program, they are limited to six to eight weeks of paid, paternal leave. This is hardly enough time for a new family to adjust to a caring, and caring for their baby.
8592	Hernandez	Ed	103	2V6gzfYtqAs	722	741	So I understand where you're coming from, but I can't support at this time, because I believe that the patient is given the information. The information is stored securely. We have very, very strict federal HIPAA requirements that does not allow anybody to get that information on the patient.
8593	Block	Marty	59	pw6Q8UN0xPc	1139	1152	Frankly, it's a wonderful package after several years, those of us who've been here for a while, of cuts and of, at best steady budgets, being able to fund all these important programs, is what we came here for frankly.
8594	Stone	Jeff	26	0RRItBGCgNM	1525	1537	And how do you get the acute attention when it could be an hour or two hours that this type of response is going to be necessary to save the loss of life. And I just, I don't see the nexus.
8595	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	jDtW4rS0Mqk	218	241	Parole calculation corrections. The issue before the subcommittee is the Governor's budget request for the $14.6 million and 92.6 additional positions in 2015-2016 and ongoing to meet caseload ratios to allow us to collectively bargain and consistent with the California parole supervision and re-integration model. That's a mouthful. Go.
8596	Anderson	Joel	57	Iv2-QZj_dZk	1204	1222	But the rule's changed today. And, so, we're forcing a lot of folks to go out and purchase memberships and services where they do nothing but monitor this, and give them updates all the time. And, I think our goal is an amiable one.
8597	Medina	Jose	81	qvwEtfRitEI	529	547	Yes. First let me say that I think there may have been a mistake in the fiscal analysis that came forward, and I just ask that, that be looked at. Because I know there was a mistake in the analysis.
8598	Alejo	Luis	9	99NWh04_JOI	1649	1663	Well, to all concerns, of balancing the interest, protecting the doctor's independent judgment. And also looking after the consumer's interest and looking at these new co-located models and try and find what's the right balance to write in a bill.
8599	Campos	Nora	76	ZDCiwfvu_KE	13	30	Thank you Mr. Chair and members of the committee. I present to you AB 375. A bill that seeks to help address teacher recruitment and retention issues by expanding paid parental leave.
8600	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	FVQ4YG_BqFE	708	736	Unfortunately, we are no stranger in my community to oil spills and then we fast forward to May 19th of this year, which happens to also be my birthday, so I'm doubly resentful of the fact that this spill occurred. But nonetheless, an on-shore pipeline carrying crude oil ruptured and spilled at least 100,000 gallons of oil,
8601	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	NwesQVgY4qI	950	976	And I also think it's very important for law enforcement officers. As someone who, quite frankly, had a non-criminal grand jury investigation put on him, me. And looking at the recommendations that came out from that grand jury and wondering 90% of it I agreed with, but the 10%, I didn't agree with.
8602	Hernandez	Ed	103	cVvEnGhVv_c	360	389	Xavier Morales, PhD Executive Director Latino Coalition for a Healthy California. Jonathan Tran, Policy and Advocacy Manager of Southeast Asia Resource Action Center. Also Ayako Miyashita, Inaugural Brian Belt HIV Law and Policy Fellow at the Williams Institute. My understanding one of the individuals has to leave early is that correct? So we'll let that individual go first.
8603	Hertzberg	Robert	99	hp2WTRF5hkg	901	912	But, but, so, so I'm with you on that. I'm completely with you. But what you, there's 2 sides to the jobs here. You also have a lot of union jobs that are risk for places that are going to go out of business because these RPS contracts are going out.
8604	Chavez	Rocky	83	dpByeg5zAi8	1357	1374	It requires more professional development by the administrators. It's clearly that the CTA support this. Recognizing the more time to evaluate people. It's clearly that some members of this committee should support it, because they recognize that we need to do more professional development.
8605	Williams	Das	12	gRicLj3q_0M	165	192	AB 802 corrects and streamlines barriers to this program. First, it gives building owners the option to request aggregated whole building monthly usage information for the purpose of managing energy use in their buildings. So that they can pursue basic energy efficiency and renewable investments. This bill makes it clear utilities are not impeded by rules developed by the CPUC.
8606	Wood	Jim	72	X-EMNVy0KVE	525	540	We've heard from groups that oppose the bill. Some of their concern, some of their concerns, and I don't believe they are all completely correct. Providers can continue to prescribe traditional opioid drugs. It does not mandate that provider prescribe this formulation only.
8607	Hall	Isadore	1	tae4cv2hHsk	674	689	Very good. Thank you. Any other witnesses in favor? Witnesses in opposition? Any questions, concerns, unreadiness from the members? Is there a motion on the bill? The bill's been properly moved. Madame Secretary, please call the roll.
8608	Liu	Carol	63	tIl0bzr-tVs	122	140	And during the 13-14 school year roughly 269,000 students in California experience homelessness. These pupils have very little in the way of structured support and for many of them their own safety net and stable connection is their school.
8609	Stone	Jeff	26	RJGZrXESD6M	2291	2307	This is going to make more jurors available for the more serious crimes, and at a time when we talk about court funding being low and not commensurate with the kind of judicial services that need to be delivered.
8610	Calderon	Ian Charles	115	llrxaJMn6L0	586	603	This bill, when you take a look at what other pieces of legislation have passed in other states specific to this issue, is far beyond what, it goes far beyond in terms of regulation. It goes far beyond in terms of protections than any other bill goes.
8611	Pavley	Fran	104	tX-iRiZ5OnY	1186	1218	I do like that. Thank you Bob, I'm gonna quote you on that. So it was interesting. Senator Wieckowski's comments on eligibility. I have my doubts as far as the road maintenance really being the, meeting the legal nexus, cuz generally good road maintenance means more cars even want to be on the road, because it's repaired and no potholes and on and on.
8612	Bonta	Rob	85	0hkCdiDRiI0	321	333	Good afternoon. We're, we're going to commence the Health Committee meeting of the Assembly for April 28th. A couple of quick announcements, and we'll do the first order of business.
8613	Runner	Sharon	4656	g1KhSxf2FKA	230	250	They will not give us the ability to have a clinic or a hospital in that area, and it's unfortunate. You know we have one supervisor who represents 2 million people. Just to drive up to the Villa Valley from the office is a good hour and a half.
8614	Leno	Mark	60	Pt2Dhj6vkoE	1857	1870	Thank you Senator. We've had discussions. I'm not sure how much you were here for them to make a definitive comment, "these are raises is not even needed". I don't think it quite fits the context of what we've been discussing.
8615	Beall	Jim	92	7aIanLUJ17E	663	689	That's 8-0 we'll put it on call for other members to vote. Members, we heard item seven already in the committee as a whole before we had a quorum. We are recommending approval of this with three amendments accepted by the author. Can I have a motion to that effect?  Okay, that side with seven. Okay, we have a motion on that item. Why don't we call the roll.
8616	Runner	Sharon	4656	g1KhSxf2FKA	250	267	So, I would love to have a separate county and I'll work with you to try and get that done, but I believe it takes a vote of the county to do that. And I don't know how Orange County got away from LA, but maybe it was.
8617	Hancock	Loni	98	bv9YSPFbNEk	713	745	Its a little cumbersome and difficult right now, we think it could be facilitated. And then to augment the ROC proposal, since we all agree it's the direction we want to move in so that we can help the counties do that. I think there are quite a number of counties that are actively interested now, and certainly, if we streamlined the process, there would be others that would as well. So I move the staff recommendation.
8618	Nguyen	Janet	65	JM1ztwrhmks	1271	1283	At the end of the day, it's to cure them for their life and for their family, not in any way of stopping that between the patient, the doctors, and the innovation that can cure that.
8619	Wolk	Lois	94	9P0OZVf3kdQ	512	521	I would just ask for your aye vote and thank the staff and the chair for assisting us in this bill. Thank you. And your suggestions, actually, which we will follow.
8620	Santiago	Miguel	17	Hvyw9CxPJq8	741	753	So in a roundabout way this actually strengthens the 75/25. And I understood what your question was which is why I jumped in, and thank you for allowing me to answer that. We'll see.
8621	Leno	Mark	60	4HKs3ChJG74	872	890	benefit persons with developmental disabilities living in the community. So, it is, yes, just intent language, but on the other hand, I don't think we've ever put it into law before. But that is what we intend to do as we come closer to those closures. I'm sure you have a response to that. Go right ahead.
8622	Weber	Shirley	44	-R2gq2-ns5U	773	785	I think given our recent outbreak in the measles and ebola, there was great concern that as a state the size that we are that we don't have our own labs to basically respond to the issues quickly enough.
8623	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	22lWaj2Ih1o	990	1013	As the analysis notes, this bill has negligible costs to the state. Local agencies have the authority to charge fees to pay the required updates. This measure represents a significant step forward that will help ensure that cities and counties are planning for the safety of their communities into the future as the effects of climate change continue to evolve.
8624	Mitchell	Holly	64	Ea-UVDMoM1k	827	846	in the budget it still contains the desired expectation around closure of the developmental centers. Which starts the train out the station. And many of the investments that we discussed in Sub 3 in this House, as well as the Assembly, are talking about the reality of what happens to the people who live there.
8625	Hertzberg	Robert	99	a6D1KFF96cc	1452	1463	Just, a lawyer question in a judiciary committee, how do you determine someone's legal status? Right? I mean we, we, we have this notion of national origin that has been litigated. We know, I get that.
8626	Thurmond	Tony	4	gf6xiaI75uY	361	370	Well, it's just a question just seems to me that even if we say clarification, that it would be changing the law in the sense that it's changing our practice.
8627	Pavley	Fran	104	oUB8meWTgiM	973	991	We did not ask for or make up the problem with the EPA in discovering that 2500 injection wells have maybe been placed too close to ground water basins that could contaminate them.
8628	Quirk	Bill	23	bHho7H6wssE	804	819	One of the major arguments against your bill, by the way I'm going to support your bill, no question. One of the major arguments. Yeah, we don't applaud, but thank you anyway.
8629	Thurmond	Tony	4	H9sj-95HbgQ	1477	1498	To really get somewhere on affordable housing. To really get Californians out of poverty, and to find it in ways that maybe not everybody's going to vote for it, but no one can refute that Democrats, that Republicans, that regardless of the client of the state, regardless of your party we gotta lift all boats out of poverty. Thanks for bringing this measure.
8630	Wilk	Scott	19	IxMULKwgq0k	892	903	Okay thank you. Are there any other nos out there? Okay, seeing none. Before we move to questions from the committee, you want to respond to anything, Senator, or?
8631	Dahle	Brian	47	AW7ZOJRT_Sc	80	91	So, I sat on the Board of Supervisors for sixteen years and, we have very rural counties that I represent in my district right now and I'm concerned with the putting an unfunded mandate basically on the counties to implement this.
8632	Thurmond	Tony	4	q7LT4HnI37Y	570	588	Just as an add on to Mr. Bonta's questioning, would you provide a year to year report about how you're doing? Because it seems to me, we want to give you the resources that you need to do the job. As someone stated, I think we wanna also tie some metrics to that, so that we can tell the story. Really, we're not here to jam anybody up.
8633	Morrell	Mike	51	NlG9S3jpnwA	1373	1397	Okay, one statement, then one question. And this is just my observation since Dodd-Frank. I was speaking, the mortgage lenders were in town one day I went to one of their breakfasts and they said that since Dodd-Frank, with all the regulations, 82% of small lenders and people in the mortgage business, for home mortgages, have gotten out of the business since then. That's incredible.
8634	Holden	Chris	78	DT3707YnrIQ	904	921	Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Committee Members. I'd like to thank you for allowing me the opportunity to present Assembly Bill 1378. This measure recognizes the evolving nature of marital relations and living patterns of Californians by expanding eligibility for a Proposition 6090 transfer.
8635	Burke	Autumn	6	R5jZe-4pYBI	1899	1916	Wait, well first just to be clear. Certified nurse midwives with this bill can continue to work in non-profit clinics, they would just have to continue to work there. They can be employed there, but they would have to be certified. So that's what the amendment, supervised, sorry, oh my gosh, supervised.
8636	Thurmond	Tony	4	adewtR6e1X4	1631	1653	And he is among those, Jim Burton, who led the closure at Agnews and always the focus was, not just saving dollars, but doing what was in the best interest of the person served. And that was always driven by their individual program plan, and their life plan, that they helped to write. And so, just know that, as we have these conversations, we will let that guide us.
8637	Pan	Richard	96	51wXJ30ZLf4	1148	1158	I think there are some refinements that the plans have brought up that we should really look at, but when we don't have, and sometimes we're still figuring out what the right therapy is.
8638	Mitchell	Holly	64	8epuGfrU4TQ	956	970	And we've already talked about the challenges posed by not including folks who are self-employed. So, what's the dollar amount for the outreach? I want to get a sense of how earnest our effort is to outreach this population.
8639	Lara	Ricardo	107	5cbDr55Nnpw	1022	1035	Without objection, the Senate journals for April 6th through April 9th, 2015 will be approved as corrected by the minute clerk. Any other motions? Resolutions and notice numbers. Great, we will now move to consideration of the daily file. Moving first to second, our second reading file, secretary, please read.
8640	Pavley	Fran	104	hP3pxZDGmwM	30	56	First of all, items and two and four will be continued at the request of the authors to April 28, that's file item two, Senate Bill 233 by Senator Hertzberg relating to marine resources rigs to reef, and file item four, SB 317, Senator De Leon's bill relating to a state parks bond.
8641	Leno	Mark	60	11yyICoQ5m8	1784	1796	But, before I can support it on the floor, I need to get some of these questions answered. So, appropriations is a fine place to do it. We also have the benefit of the second year of a two-year session.
8642	Lackey	Tom	10	n81cNAsH1gw	887	900	And, our decisions here may mean whether this person actually gets assistance or not, and could be a survivability issue. So this is a very serious issue, and very happy to see that it's being brought forward.
8643	Monning	Bill	25	npLG8Ena6eQ	2142	2158	This bill addresses a very limited universe. People with a terminal illness with less than six months to live, but it addresses an even more limited universe, those who seek to consider this as a possible option.
8644	Monning	Bill	25	uHo2rJWlejE	1391	1402	But I think it would be helpful for us in the Legislature, and helpful for taxpayers, when they see these really large costs of a treatment program. What is the cost of not using that treatment? So just, that would be helpful to us.
8645	Levine	Marc	8	G3ANKG_a4vY	0	15	Great, thank you. Any other questions? Dr. Watson, thank you so much for flying out here today. I know you're going to be bouncing right back to Denver. And your insight and understanding of the sector is very valued, so thank you for that.
8646	Hill	Jerry	66	m4t87KOfLMk	1076	1096	Thank you Mister Chair, and thank you Madam Speaker for this legislation. As someone who it referenced, I did sit on the Air Resources Board for a few years, and it was interesting. Because as I came from the Bay Area, and the Bay Area district, one of those middle class people who wasn't familiar. The first thing that I learned, one of the things that I learned was about the City of Arvin.
8647	Hill	Jerry	66	cwCFlp-Kh9Y	1794	1807	We know that PHMSA takes a long time to change its rules in the federal government and usually congress has to act before we see some result of that. But the PUC regulates the gas transmission pipelines and has the ability to go above and beyond the federal standards, so.
8648	Hill	Jerry	66	ZJAG2StITgQ	1736	1792	Yeah, I know. And as one of your licensees, I appreciate the efforts that you go through to eliminate the unlicensed contractors because they do present a problem for every licensed contractor. They do, I guess it's just the extent in which your involvement with other agencies exceeds your core mission, I guess is how I would look at it. And so that's just a concern that I have. And you may be able to argue and, maybe rightly so, that it's one in the same. Because if you're getting them with their license, then you're also getting them for tax evasion on this end, and Worker's Comp violations on that end. So, it's an interesting issue, but I guess my concern is more your core mission. And that's what you should be focused on more so, but please continue. I'm sorry.
8649	Cooley	Ken	45	VjN2j4PuSG8	252	277	And I think this is a part of a larger conversation on healthcare costs and a very important one. There is no silver bullet dealing with health care costs. Just as there is no silver bullet dealing with the cost of insurance in the 1980s, but a series of far sighted, discreet changes in the law that start reining in the dynamics of the cost system, transformed our marketplace in the insurance sector.
8650	Hertzberg	Robert	99	Rj2lrXkjDIw	2642	2662	These are really delicate questions that require a lot of complexity. This measure really is just about, I think it's appropriate and I dealt with this a lot during the energy crisis about MOUs telling us that they do not have to live by our rules, and I did it in Los Angeles, and by the way, the city of Los Angeles does not oppose this measure, the largest MOU.
8651	Cooley	Ken	45	VjN2j4PuSG8	235	252	Cost came down and I think, whether we're on it today, this issue is gonna come back to us, we are gonna have to grapple with this, it's one of the great public policy challenges of our time and so I just appreciate the Senator bringing the bill here, having the courage of your convictions.
8652	Hueso	Ben	48	20R5DjZ86C8	1371	1394	So you have found irregularities or things that you feel are not good for rate payers that have not been acted on.  Because your advisory, you says is not good, and your advice can be ignored.
8653	Chiu	David	7	dAMeavSqnLk	288	306	Colleagues, we're going to pass and retain the reconsideration items. At this time, we're going to continue the reconsideration items, and we're now going to move to the Senate third reading. We're going to start with file items 71, SB 365. The clerk will read.
8654	Allen	Travis	43	KcpO7Oo2ci0	169	187	Now, I do say many of our major carriers because there are some regional insurers who have embraced this creative small business market. Insurers such as Sharp in San Diego feel that this is a way to provide more health insurance to more people, and still be able to sustain the necessary risk pool management to provide continued health insurance coverage into the future.
8655	Leno	Mark	60	EvXJx3b_7-s	1036	1057	So, if we're going to agree to this cap on just the three campuses that are out of range with the others, Berkeley, Los Angeles and San Diego. Berkeley currently at 24% non-resident. UCLA currently 21% non-resident, San Diego 19%.
8656	Cooper	Jim	21	UdyJhNk-vh8	1341	1358	Yeah, I just want to thank my colleague for bringing this forward. I think body cameras are not a matter of if, it's a matter of when, but it has to be thoughtful, and that serves both purposes. Transparency works for the public and works for law enforcement. And we want to see more folks embrace this and come forward with it.
8657	Hueso	Ben	48	GHyOxyKfubI	46	69	And that ordinance, that law in San Diego's been so successful that we thought applying it to California statewide would help to save hundreds of lives, as many lives have already been saved. This year over 350,000 Americans are expected to suffer from sudden cardiac arrest.
8658	Chiu	David	7	X4Bkp9BrIdE	1633	1649	passed two of the laws in our city that Senator Hertzberg alluded too, which moved our open data movement, put up hundreds of data sets to make our local government more transparent, more effective, more efficient for the public, for analysts, for developers who could build apps to government.
8659	Hertzberg	Robert	99	X4Bkp9BrIdE	1105	1124	Okay, so this gives you, okay, so it's machine readable, but then what company wrote what code, with what way, with what patch, with what this, or whatever. It gives you the basics, so then somebody who wants to add value, or be able to do what Mr. Maienschein did looking at data sets, or as I felt with all the time at the public policy of
8660	Chavez	Rocky	83	jcqm9XlDQYM	859	876	Members, I stand in support of this bill and I want to explain it, not so much to all you, but I can actually tell you the hundreds if not thousands of people who have been calling my office over the past 48 hours since I supported this healthcare bill.
8661	De Leon	Kevin	102	ze-YP1FOzwQ	549	573	The fact is investing coal is simply not worth the risk. With each passing day, the writing on the wall becomes clearer and clearer. Our policies and technologies and global markets are moving in concert away from coal, but don't take my word for it, instead listen to Robert Murray, founder CEO of Murray Energy, the third-largest coal company in the nation.
8662	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	itjqf4OHel4	1713	1733	Well, I do not know the world of EMT's and ambulance drivers, but I do not that there are some who work sort of on a, I don't know what do they call it piece basis that they're sort of independent. But remembering that we're talking about people taking leave for extraordinary circumstances.
8663	Brown	Cheryl	13	AXzsxnBFv8M	1410	1430	She's so excited about it. So I would like to, you know, connect back with her again, because I see that she's been able to take it to the next level. And that's what California has to do, is we do have to take this, not only conversation but, to make something happen.
8664	Williams	Das	12	n5MXFS_19l0	1210	1239	We have that tool, we should use it, we should use it better because it is the most realistic way that we can provide a deterrence and the most realistic way that we can assure survivors that if they're going to be brave enough to come forward that there may be a chance of justice. Okay, any other? The bill has been, Senator Pan. You just raised another question in Senator Pan's head.
8665	Weber	Shirley	44	MhUK5oG1VcQ	151	169	Many of our schools are struggling trying to identify kids. We need the support of foster youth services that are experts in helping and providing support. And so this bill then would align those two groups so that all of our foster kids would be able to get the care. We have some witnesses with us today. I'll have them introduce themselves to talk about this bill.
8666	Mitchell	Holly	64	jjB76hKrhNA	1036	1054	married a fellow colleague, Tomas Robinson and they relocated to Michigan for her husband to pursue his new teaching career. They relocated with their three then, very young daughters to Sacramento in 1975. Carolyn began work with the Senate as a scheduler
8667	Chavez	Rocky	83	myyM8i0TuNI	731	748	Because, I think currently, what was I reading, the Leroy F. Greene School Facilities Act of '98 requires us to allocate to school districts any new programs for upgrading modernization, so I was wondering how are we going to do this?
8668	Gray	Adam	27	NB_4qAwCIAU	952	974	Okay, do we have any other questions from members? Seeing none at this time, thank you for your presentation. If folks involved in our second panel would please approach. We have Jennifer Henderson, Deputy Attorney General, Indian Gaming Law Section, Department of Justice,
8669	Ting	Philip	30	rek1UfAle3c	475	493	Thank you. Anyone in opposition? Okay, going back to the committee. Any committee comments or questions? Okay, seeing none. Appreciate the author for bringing this I think very important bill forward. And with that do you want to close?
8670	Williams	Das	12	WR_bP6j3vkM	1839	1861	Other witnesses in support or in opposition? Witnesses with testimony neither it's in support or in opposition to the committee? Questions, comments from the committee? There's been a motion for due pass as amended, motion by Stone, second by Williams. Please call the roll.
8671	Cooley	Ken	45	kLTY4thtXsA	38	53	And this is a follow on to the 1996 approval by California voters of the Compassionate Use Act, Proposition 215, allowing patients and primary care givers to obtain and use medical marijuana as recommended by a physician.
8672	Wood	Jim	72	UUDrPWxX9_Y	575	604	My bill addresses critical environmental issues that are having enormous effects on the residents of the district I represent. I also seek to allow for significant local control. Local jurisdictions have a far better knowledge of their individual land use requirements and local ordinances. I believe that the local ordinances should be protected and respected. I know that local jurisdictions are looking for a significant guidance from the state. However, I fear that a one-size-fits-all approach, without some local flexibility, is doomed to fail.
8673	Santiago	Miguel	17	tEhMYBdIqkE	1598	1618	So I won't go into why I think the merits of it are important. But I would ask you in your conversation to help us identify those very specific things that are doable towards prosecution. Obviously prevention would be the main thing. But listen, I took this issue up quite frankly and I never had an opportunity to share with very many people.
8674	Melendez	Melissa	41	b7XHatlYhkw	1567	1577	We have very clear evidence that sometimes things take place in this building that shouldn't. You are very well aware of that, given the fact that you've served in the assembly before. Correct?
8675	Beall	Jim	92	GcYm7_0fTAo	1348	1374	We have to do it in a fiscally responsible manner where true issues that are raised, that need to be addressed, should be raised, but what I call false issues should not be used to exacerbate the problems that redevelopment created in the dissolution. So we have to be very careful about weighing and judging those particular issues.
8676	Nielsen	Jim	68	Ea-UVDMoM1k	361	377	put pressure on to have to renew the $30 billion tax increase, that it appears the Governor doesn't support that either. And they would not build budgets based on that assumption that, oh well, we'll pick up that $30 billion and just keep rolling it with our spending.
8677	Leno	Mark	60	rD0VjcELenc	1818	1834	Mrs. McEvoy was the granddaughter of M. H. de Young, who was the co-founder of the San Francisco Chronicle, and she was a long-time board chair of Chronicle Publishing. She also ran the Peace Corps African Program as a special assistant
8678	Hernandez	Ed	103	o6dY6yB1_H8	783	793	Just for the sake of comparison, I'm going to give you an example of a large pepperoni pizza at Round Table will run you around $23. That's more than what a provider gets to see a patient.
8679	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	i9llaC_1rmE	92	112	Newly hired state employees begin their careers with no sick leave, it has to be accrued and it is accrued slowly after their first month of employment at the rate of eight hours per month. As a result, disabled veterans who have recently started working for the state may not have sufficient leave time to attend to their medical care.
8680	Lara	Ricardo	107	tHDAU5JmwzE	1424	1438	SB 645, afterschool programs. Do pass as amended to make implementation contingent upon funding in the state budget. Substitute the role from SB454, that was approved on a five to two vote, with Republicans voting no.
8681	Weber	Shirley	44	nY2N1xKF-1M	272	308	Thank you very much. I'm pleased to convene the first budget hearing of the year and kick-off what we consider the 2015 budget process. Hopefully, a very dynamic and important process. The first thing we're going to do today, of course, is adopt committee rules. So, at this point you should have all received in your packet a copy of the proposed committee rules. They are identical to last year's rules. If there aren't any questions concerning that I would entertain a motion to adopt the proposed rules. It has been moved in second. Roll call please.
8682	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	Uu6l955bq80	943	958	And, also a need to find some funding there's gotta be a way to do better in this. We have an opportunity for public comment and if we have the office of consumer rights, excuse me civil rights, come back.
8683	Chiu	David	7	KfUw5Z9TrzY	1442	1457	Current law has a default prohibition against ebikes in our state. The rules of the road for these bikes have not been clear. And Californians have been slow. To replace car trips with e-bikes. Most electric bicycles are designed to behave exactly like regular bicycles.
8684	Stone	Mark	20	df4VleG_VbQ	1556	1572	Okay thank you.  I'm now going to open it up to members of the audience who would like to come up and address this committee again please give your name your affiliation and that you oppose the bill, this is those who are opposed to the bill please.
8685	Monning	Bill	25	8vnz5G2is0o	653	678	Safeguards against coercion of patients by establishing felony penalties for coercion or forging a request are built-in to the law. The attending physician is required to discuss feasible alternatives or additional treatment alternatives, with the terminally ill patient, including comfort care, Hospice care, palliative care, and pain management.
8686	Chavez	Rocky	83	ZXZJp00flVo	1294	1305	Thank you, just wanted on the record cuz this is important and I won't be in those meetings that go on behind the rooms but this is important, so thank you.
8687	Pavley	Fran	104	hP3pxZDGmwM	258	280	So I wanted to just take a survey on the mining bill because of the attendance from so many of you here on file item nine. There's one organization that says that they were making a formal presentation. May I see a hand on that organization? And you are representing whom?
8688	Stone	Jeff	26	pIm79elnbMQ	1460	1472	You're negotiating an increase in salary, you should pay it. So, why don't we take that tact and, again, trying to shave a save the tax payers money wherever we can. Maybe the LAO can also respond to that.
8689	Weber	Shirley	44	7i9bh_kaYv0	77	91	It also addresses the concerns raised by the opponents in prior bills by adding a section that specifically states that this bill does not stop a parent for applying to homeschool their children instead of enrolling them in a traditional kindergarten program.
8690	Leno	Mark	60	R0xKhCYzBZA	1868	1884	But I do want to ask you just a little bit further. The standard that is going to be met to measure consistent failure sounds more than a little subjective at this point. Is there anything more specific that you can add?
8691	Thurmond	Tony	4	8w2MCxTnakA	4	21	Thank you. Thank you, and thank you, senators. It's an opportunity to present AB 1025 which, in many ways, is a complementary bill. AB 1025 would help to provide mental health services to students in our schools.
8692	Quirk	Bill	23	-O56kS7yA2Y	1547	1565	Well, there have requests been to departments for all videos since 1776. This is clearly, for example in LA, where you've got over a million hours recorded, would be a tremendous burden. How do you balance those?
8693	Garcia	Cristina	112	ZW0bBeI7WzQ	89	101	It's something that's needed in my district and something that's gonna start to address an issue that I go home to on a regular basis to hear about these energies. So I see a real opportunity here. I just wanna make sure, and we've had this discussion and it's more of a statement just for the record.
8694	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	A2CxN21_Gyw	1131	1162	And in order to do that, as I understand it with this bill, you have got to go in and request from the court the ability to simply get the envelope. And requiring a court action just to be able to get into the internet account of the decedent. If you want more than that, let's see, if you wanna get more than just the envelope, you have to then go back to court and
8695	Stone	Jeff	26	iTrvWXqiedk	1934	1953	Also with respect to using them as a speed deterrent, that's not something I think a traffic engineer would endorse. Usually you use an 85th percentile, and then you determine what the speeds are. And then at appropriate locations where you have crosswalks and things like that, that might be an appropriate place for stop signs.
8696	Gomez	Jimmy	80	rOcxPrNyERc	995	1015	We provide people with greater and greater opportunities to eliminate the disparities that individuals from different backgrounds face. So this is just, yes, another step but it's in a long step thathas been continued for generations. I ask for your aye vote.
8697	Chiu	David	7	7KrRcZ9ORsY	2080	2101	Again the suggestion that there's anything in this bill that would prevent a Senator from providing the services that they're currently providing is just not true. There's nothing in this bill that forces any of these clinics to close their doors, that prevent, that requires clinics to not engage in whatever they're engaged in at this point.
8698	Holden	Chris	78	yhx1NvxzAgA	1808	1832	That she has an option to be able to take her case up and to seek justice. And I think that's the kind of scenario we're looking at. And I think it's also, and I'll just cite that the legislature has been supportive in terms of the statute of limitations question, has supported similar efforts.
8699	Thurmond	Tony	4	dGJ3Wrr59rg	1856	1890	And the other question I was gonna ask is about the actual community based providers, and I know that many of them have struggled to continue to provide services because of the decade of cuts that Mr. Martin described. It struck me, that these services, as you held up the Lannerman guide, it struck me that these services are in fact an entitlement, are they not? We are required to provide them. If we allow any more of our service providers to close, are we not in fact failing to meet that entitlement. Because there wont be available services for those that need them?
8700	Pan	Richard	96	BDjsPtF4Upk	762	784	And in addition to that, we're going to create a situation where basically the doctors who are basically being told that if you're out-of-network which means that you couldn't come to a contract with the plan, you're going to have a default rate unless you go through bureaucratic process which may or may not even exists at the time the problem shows up, and what do you think the doctors are going to do?
8701	Pan	Richard	96	6e0LFFmZAnE	801	817	But since I'm not the attorney, I'll perhaps let the attorneys answer that question. And also if it's okay, Mr. Chair, to maybe cite a couple of more specific examples in addition to what I represented regarding the examples where this kind of discrimination is taking place.
8702	Stone	Mark	20	FA0o_dng1YE	1234	1251	Yeah, I'm not sure. I'm not sure what I would be suggesting at this point but I'd like to be able to talk about it. I mean, there is a reason that those cost are high. There is a reason that these are risky investments and that there are, I mean should be concerned about who may get targeted.
8703	Bates	Pat	58	vjd6Y9hnzuc	1045	1064	So I think it's important as part of the information for us not to think that we're not ready with certain incidents. If we had the San Andreas fault that we're seeing the movie on, I guess nothing can help us at that time. I was watching that thing. It just looked like the end of the world.
8704	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	4l5FjBTBUZQ	299	332	to be a place that, five years after this legislation was adopted, five years later this space was recognized as a Marine Protected Reserve because it is one of five places on the entire planet to have an ecosystem such as the one that we have in that area with fragile marine life and mammals seen nowhere else on the planet. And yet to this day there is a potential that oil development could take place because of this
8705	Gaines	Beth	109	elq7nOJOh90	698	719	Peter requested that anyone wishing to honor his memory make a donation to the Julianne Maria Huerta memorial scholarship fund at Sacramento State University. Peter was instrumental in establishing this fund in honor of Julianne, a former legislative staffer who lost her long battle with breast cancer in 2008.
8706	Hancock	Loni	98	Oc8_cozASuQ	1406	1432	With that I would like to invite J. "Piper" Ferreira to come up. He is one of the few individuals that I know, although there are probably more, who have walked in both roles, profoundly. He grew up in west Oakland and in Berkeley.
8707	Wieckowski	Bob	55	jna-qIkO0Wg	1756	1772	So, on the natural, we have the drought, so many of the trees have died. So those trees are eliminated. Are other species coming in that may not be healthy for the forest? Or how do-
8708	Block	Marty	59	eHKo1SK8Zvs	1551	1567	Thank you. Like to invite Natasha Collins from the Legislative Analyst's Office, Cindy Kazanis from the Department of Education, and Amber Alexander from the Department of Finance. And we will begin with Natasha Collins from the LAO.
8709	Gordon	Richard	117	d1S1T4q9GVM	1106	1125	But I wanna assure this committee that we will meet with Ms. Grady further review her concerns and see if we can further refine this legislation. It is not our intent, in any way shape or form, to provide any diminishment to the ability for folks to donate food.
8710	McGuire	Mike	93	nKjAvt3bj9Q	291	310	Thank you so much Doctor. Very grateful for your thoughts and for your dedication to foster youths as well. Thank you so much for being here. It is now my pleasure to be able to introduce Jennifer Rodriguez. She is the Executive Director of the Youth Law Center and Ms. Rodriguez the floor is yours and thank you so much for being here.
8711	Pan	Richard	96	HutoDdelxCc	517	536	Thank you. Thank you so much. I think you've sort of answered my first question, which is that this really is more like repairs in many ways. There's always a blurry line between what's repair and new construction but basically these are existing schools that need to have their facilities upgraded, correct?
8712	Stone	Jeff	26	y23O4kWOpz4	566	583	Senator, I don't disagree with you that we wanna make sure we protect the environment. We wanna make sure that we have clean water, but we have a tendency to be very over reactive in the state of California to the point where we over-regulate these industries out of business.
8713	Allen	Benjamin	70	Zk_K_zhn8-Q	1284	1297	Now, I understand this one-on-one Committee's going to be a very interesting one, and I certainly am just as interested in it with Senator Block and what's going to come out of it.  And I think the two Governors are very smart.
8714	Low	Evan	11	QkQlxH8U7IE	1894	1919	The shorthand is essentially just discrimination, blatant discrimination of any sort to say that on the posting. We don't want any public official to participate, and be part of our organization. This is flat out, and I know that witness has some insight with this as well. But the intent especially is to give everyone that equal opportunity and access. That's fundamentally what this bill is trying to address and if the chair might allow.
8715	Pan	Richard	96	zjh5VKf9m04	1014	1043	All right, any other questions? Okay, it changes that question. So you mentioned that certainly one piece you said in terms of giving people more options, but in terms of trying to figure out the state contribution, certainly we heard from the previous panel, one is that you'd have a shift, right?
8716	Gatto	Mike	46	WbiiRILqv6s	419	444	We have a question from ESrush and this questioner asks: "I'm concerned about the safety of medical and financial information at health insurance companies, particularly in light of recent breaches. Will this committee be thinking of taking action on this issue?" Does anyone want to weigh in on data breaches in terms of health care?
8717	Leyva	Connie	62	SU8_KAMcIaE	1618	1630	I represent the good folks who live in SD 20, commonly known as the Inland Empire, and we have certainly had our fair share of  bad air quality over the years.
8718	Calderon	Ian Charles	115	HBHfaes5iio	1695	1705	Are they sending them a piece of mail? And after sending them something by mail does it make it within that ten day period, and maybe did that ten day period had something to do with the amount of time it takes to get in contact with them?
8719	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	519YUTER2IM	1652	1673	The agencies are going to have to take into consideration the factors such as location, which I think was mentioned whether it's in a coastal area or in a different area, you know, the regional climate, and the operating capacity, when they set these performance standards.
8720	Hancock	Loni	98	w14C8IiFUpY	931	956	I would think that it would be and goodness knows there's a huge need for support workers in so many fields - working with people, working with children. Thank you Michelle for nodding. You're our touchstone in this. Does it make a difference to real people? It was just something that occurred to me - $600 million - this is huge.
8721	Bonta	Rob	85	rhpqVSvkkLg	871	905	The current vote count is four to eight. The bill's on call and needs six more votes to pass. Thank you. Members who intend to vote in health committee today, please return to committee to cast your votes. Staff who are watching, please reach out to your members to. Get them in committee to vote. We're gonna through bills that are on call, and add-ons.
8722	Stone	Mark	20	4XOeWVTUKok	8	32	Thank you Mr. Chair. Members, I will begin as witnesses show up. AB 1134 is about symmetry really and currently when issuing concealed carry weapons permits, generally it is the county sheriffs that do that and in some instances potentially a Police Chief in a City.
8723	Pan	Richard	96	EeHY3lg6hXA	19	36	you know, certainly appreciate you saying that, thank you but we don't need more resources perhaps right now, but and, I think if you're really going to fall on the lines of this is going to be a non-punitive ,this is really about helping people, I think what you,
8724	Hertzberg	Robert	99	3ZbkIQK-LEk	152	162	And so what's happened when these folks signed their initial leases some time ago they're required once they're finished pumping to clean the thing up, restore it back to its natural condition.
8725	Moorlach	John	4657	4mB1nCFXohc	1666	1686	And we need to help, not only the State, we need to help counties and cities cuz this seems like an industry that's ripe for this kind of nonsense. And so I agree with Senator Beall that something needs to be done and there should be some kind of penalty clauses, cuz we wouldn't tolerate this with someone who's adding a room to our home, or building a road, or whatever else.
8726	Mitchell	Holly	64	6XCg5Ws00TU	1281	1294	And just playing Devil's Advocate, let's say that it does not meet their approval, what then happens with the one resident who's there? Is that something we back fill again or would that resident then be transferred elsewhere?
8727	Hernandez	Ed	103	lA7lgET9urw	107	122	The last one, we had last year. And from that, we gathered a lot of information. We were able to come up with information that would allow us to shape policy to make sure that we control our costs within our health care system.
8728	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	zqM_Vy0kspE	2447	2463	But, I like what you're trying to accomplish here, and so with the notion that I'll keep watching as it goes forward because this, I think should we be able to succeed with this and get the product on the market and being used by people.
8729	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	IRk3z3ZISoY	89	119	Thank you Mr Chair, and Members. I'd like to present SB 358, which will revise California's Equal Pay Act I'm very excited to bring this bill to you today because this is, in my opinion, an excellent effort to deal with the problem that has existed in the state of California for decades, and one which I have personally been fighting to achieve for only the past 35 or 40 years.
8730	Hancock	Loni	98	bWj7FpZXUfY	1264	1282	Thank you, I am going to have to go and present two bills in public safety, so if we're going to have a very extended discussion, I'm sorry I had hoped to be here for the discussion. This is the way the legislature works.
8731	Gordon	Richard	117	wr_Nl1-RdXY	2046	2075	What concerns me about the way this is structured however is that we agreed a year ago in initially establishing the cap and trade program that 60% of the funds would be continually appropriated. And 40% would be available for the legislature at our discretion to annually allocate in reviewing the governor's proposal and our own desires.
8732	Mendoza	Tony	52	vlw5hzqZMso	1206	1224	Are you in a constant contact with them or are they communicating with you and asking questions about your report, getting more analysis, more specific, I should say more and in-depth questions in regards to some of the work that you put into this report?
8733	Hertzberg	Robert	99	Rj2lrXkjDIw	1657	1674	But here's how I see this bill. First of all, 75% of Californians are now subject to the law. This is simply telling those people who happen to be in jurisdictions that have municipal utilities that they have to comply what the PUC says and what this legislature and the governor said, point one.
8734	Pavley	Fran	104	wPtjftt3FVU	203	221	We heard from people that live throughout the state of California, where all of a sudden their water table went down because someone is conducting fracking and let a lease to an oil company coming in.
8735	Gallagher	James	108	vSlds1mrYHQ	1436	1451	It sounds like with the Antiquities Act and what we're seeking to do here with declaring a monument, it gives Secretary of Interior a broad discretion to decide which uses should be allowed and should not be allowed.
8736	Stone	Mark	20	Wt_ez7F9UlE	254	274	Well, in the transgender community, someone may express male but yet genetically be female or vice versa. What we don't want is for an individual to be challenged based on a presumption from one of the attorneys and introduce bias in that sense.
8737	Bonilla	Susan	3	OcW4SGQXlmw	163	185	in both of the, you know, affected departments and DGS, as well, back from the beginning. And the timeline shows that. So I don't know that that's a question or just a, you know, a statement here. But I really feel that one of the things we need back is assur-, more than assurance. We need to actually have demonstrated,
8738	Monning	Bill	25	msMPqU5kPd8	983	1001	I know this bill has a way to go. I know that that the Chair will be voicing his views. And I'm curious to hear those as well. But I just wanna thank those who have engaged today in a respectful and informed and principle discourse.
8739	Hancock	Loni	98	zZG9dtpoc3o	274	287	On the face of this, I understand exactly what you're asking for and I think it's common sense. You want people to be identified for who they really are.
8740	Pavley	Fran	104	Q1ptrvjk-As	841	865	It also isn't just traditional apprenticeship programs, building trades, but it can apply to, whether it's healthcare needs in the medical field, or whether it's preschool teachers, which I know is a big focus. So this bill right now, to be frank with you, is a work in progress because of the administration's new focus on apprenticeships.
8741	Monning	Bill	25	yiLVh_sTRu0	1838	1867	Of the 41 permanent positions, the breakdown, 24 ALGs, 17 support staff. Kind of a follow-up to Senator Stone's question. When you look at the graph on page 32 of the projected reduction of penalties and maybe Department of Finance has a comment on this or LAO.
8742	Bonta	Rob	85	mNyHP9HDpqk	566	580	And I don't know what kind of Issues, especially security issues, are raised by opening it up for individuals, individuals to use. And then the, the last and perhaps the biggest issue is that, that as alluded to assembly member Cooley,
8743	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	LTEBLbyRjnQ	1002	1018	When? We don't know. By whom? We don't know. Would these people be trained? Would they be life scanned? Would they have background checks? etc. Those are all questions when you bring in third parties or third party P.E. that would arise.
8744	Nielsen	Jim	68	TSSAjU2zD6s	1516	1532	Im glad to hear that. I think that would be one of the greatest values of this "Sling Shot" because we all have problems with big government, this stifling, what we're trying to do then. Kind of a long time, many many years the goal of mine, is what I call Career tech Ed reticulation.
8745	Burke	Autumn	6	CVYbaFO-ROE	517	534	Currently the state has a number of IT projects under development that are reported to cost more than $4 billion. AB 522 will allow the state to evaluate how well a contractor performed on these IT projects by creating a contractor performance assessment reporting system.
8746	Liu	Carol	63	Laqdju9yTYg	190	230	Well, I mean, you know, those are just, for me, those are just some simple information stuff that we know how to divert people into various strategies or you know programs to improve people's conditions.  As opposed to trying to figure it out and deal with it and I know I just, I think you have all the components here and people willing to stretch themselves to help solve these problems but. And, you know. I but I do think that, well they just, we don't have resources forever. We need to have the best practices going forward.
8747	Pan	Richard	96	51wXJ30ZLf4	1221	1232	So, I appreciate your leadership, Assemblymember Nazarian. I do encourage you to continue to work with the opposition about trying to make refinements, but I think this is a very important bill, and I will be voting yes today. Thank you.
8748	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	_7J2e3A3mdU	792	813	5-2, 5 to 1, excuse me, 6-1, that bill is out. File item 13, AB 610 assembly member Joan Sawyer, the vote count is 4-0. Please call the absent members.
8749	Thurmond	Tony	4	cFLwRY925G8	382	398	So I say that to say how many of our communities are deeply impacted by this. It's is very important to me, and I really want to thank the chair for lifting up this as a topic and for your legislation, which we're certainly excited about. The potential to make a change.
8750	Stone	Mark	20	WIGYg87fotU	1329	1352	This has been a very interesting and informative hearing.  I think outlining some of the challenges that we have and, again as  a policy-making body, it is our interest to ensure that the way we're spending public dollars implements the policy of this body, as well as policies of the administration.
8751	Wilk	Scott	19	qzvpjn8Cr2Y	198	204	I have a followup, if I could. If this were to pass, you see any law of unintended consequences if this were to pass? Or you think it doesn't matter, or what?
8752	Runner	Sharon	4656	SQEMna8rhH0	1433	1457	The ruling did not alter the statutory authority of division of the adult parole, To enforce sex offender residency restrictions of up to that 2,000 feet. In the wake of retailer there is growing uncertainty regarding the application of the 2,000 foot statute. The procedure followed by the Supreme Court makes it clear.
8753	Garcia	Cristina	112	v8nsxSPxdAk	298	316	And we talk about all of the positive movements we've seen in policy and in innovation and renewables, but the reality is that I'm still breathing in that smog and that batter on a regular basis with my constituents. And so, this would be a small reprieve for all of us. And so I want to thank you for working on that.
8754	Hernandez	Ed	103	wHx-nZg7Thw	103	113	So this will be discussion only, and I understand that the vote's gonna be in a couple of weeks. Vote only. So with that I have some individuals who'd like to speak in support of the measure, and I respectfully ask for an aye vote.
8755	Gipson	Mike	28	F7lT9yIrGAY	518	540	Members. We have three audits remaining on the agenda today just want-to make mention that audit number 2015 one one five, related to cover California and the item number 2015 dash one one eight related to the City of Irvine was pool by the requesting members.
8756	Brown	Cheryl	13	HccZsvAseDo	1919	1935	He was involved in civil rights and social justice movements for over 40 years. He was politically active and was in voter registration drive with Cesar Chavez and others. He was instrumental
8757	Berryhill	Tom	54	pJxZbc1RoIw	1359	1370	Senator, you were just talking about all the additional trucks that were gonna be on the road. Do you not agree that $300 billion shouldn't be dedicated to road maintenance?
8758	Allen	Benjamin	70	acGD7CpLfyI	83	100	Can you sort of explain that phenomenon just a little bit, and I know you've spoken about it in your opening comments, but... Just kind of comment a bit on how important this is to the registrar recorder in the short term, before we move towards some of the reforms that you talked about earlier.
8759	Beall	Jim	92	84LBK3fic7E	96	108	These types of projects are multiyear effort, require multiyear effort, and require a level of financial certainty for our operators to plan. The bill allows for multiyear funding agreements to address this issue.
8760	Pavley	Fran	104	cr1U1amFOTo	1737	1766	Two other comments, I thought Senator Hertzberg was right on, having gone through the energy deregulation crisis with you as Speaker, Senator Hertzberg, you had to be here to appreciate that. But, creating the diversity in our energy mix, I think, has put us in a lot stronger place. We can withstand some of the volatility and not being ganged by out of state companies.
8761	Obernolte	Jay	86	toyLEHK5bMU	763	779	Thank you Mr. Speaker. Colleagues I rise in opposition SB 107 and in support of the arguments made by my colleagues from Fullerton and Huntington Beach. I have some history with redevelopment. I served on the board of directors of redevelopment agency, also served as the Chairman
8762	Eggman	Susan Talamantes	73	JtKXoGz7JFs	168	181	SB 323 will go a long way to ensure the primary needs of Californians addressed by a highly qualified nurse practitioner, again especially in areas that have high poverty and are already medically underserved. We respectfully ask for your aye vote when we get there.
8763	Alejo	Luis	9	-OpN4Uo7BxE	1644	1655	But just something you don't have to be talking about anymore because you have the opportunity to take action right before your eyes in this very room to make everyone automatically register to vote.
8764	Medina	Jose	81	IhpbvS6HoRM	584	589	Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members. I would like to adjourn in memory of Kushi Jones, the wife of my friend and fellow teacher Eddie Jones. Kushi was born in Burbank, California. She worked in banking at Victoria Community Church for 10 years.
8765	Beall	Jim	92	IKy1yzt0SRs	573	622	The amendments deal with the $308 million that we talked about, the 10%. That would be matched by over 150 million in federal funds if we achieve that 308 million. So it would draw down in federal money.  We've been able to save money by adjusting audit requirements for developmental disabilities, we submitted that as an amendment.
8766	Levine	Marc	8	3bQ_hUBlpio	1899	1918	Thank you Mr. Speaker and members. I rise on behalf of the Jewish Caucus to support ACR 6, designating February as Black History Month. We reflect upon and remember history to celebrate and to learn. Black History Month is about celebrating great African-Americans past and honoring their lives work and contributions.
8767	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	HL5dQ4Xf2nk	7	35	To our distinguished guests who have traveled to be here with us this afternoon. On that subject, I have to announce that one of our proposed speakers, Michael E Drobac, the executive director of the Small UAV Coalition, couldn't make it because he was stuck in snow in Washington DC and on the tarmac for five hours without the ability to get out so he will not be with us today.
8768	Chau	Ed	116	2Dc5I9_7zFA	144	165	Again, the zero requirement is gone. This bill would continue to allow a local government to require more parking if it has completed a parking study. To address concerns raised by the league, the amendment's also increased the duration of the parking study to within seven years of a developer's request that supports the need for more parking, rather than five years.
8769	Cannella	Anthony	61	CKcxsxPbopg	27	44	Well, thank you, Mr. President and colleagues. As I've got some guests moving up here in the back I rise today to represent SR12, which celebrates National Engineers Week from February 22nd to the 28. As a civil engineer, I certainly respect all the many things that engineers do for our great country and all the achievements engineers have made throughout history.
8770	Liu	Carol	63	nhiEIYehp1Y	3	23	Time is precious and we are administering this committee through sign up. We have 20 bills today. Two bills on consent. One has been pulled, that's item 19, AB1260.
8771	Mathis	Devon	75	jj5fwuuTvrg	1376	1400	Stopping the train will result in some losses to be sure, but with no viable funding solution to complete the project in the first place, does it make sense for us to throw good money after bet? I do believe the train to nowhere can provide food, sanitation, or water. Last year's water bond was a down payment,
8772	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	E7fL6Rs-58o	1463	1479	File item 112 has been dispensed with. We will go now to file items 113 114, 115, 117, and 118. File item 113, Senator McGuire. Mr. Secretary, please read.
8773	De Leon	Kevin	102	ofo4g2uUHBA	1324	1348	Realtime and real talk and not agency, bureaucratic speak, hide the ball, give answers that are vague and ambiguous that we can't figure out what they are and it does create an environment where members of the legislature act legislatively.
8774	Cooley	Ken	45	KrJyHNx6FKg	264	283	So we have done what we can do in California with a single, stand-alone pool to develop an earthquake insurance product. We've actually done it a couple of times. We did it in the 1980s with something known as CRAF. We now have the CEA. We learned lessons from CRAF. We sort of pushed the envelope on what a single state can do.
8775	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	OVIQdDmHNzI	2060	2077	Again, this is a work in progress. We acknowledge it is a gut and amend, but based upon the fact that we did not anticipate this event, and once you have something happen you are not serving your constituents or the state well if you ignore it.
8776	Atkins	Toni	110	3I7f3vKVAeA	2325	2343	I know that sounds really dull and boring at nine o'clock, but this is the hard work. These are the details, these are the details that give us the information we need to really move California forward and to take care of our communities, to make our communities healthier.
8777	Monning	Bill	25	HJEL7SBoV-4	1233	1251	Thank you, Ana. Thank you for bringing this forward. I've represented workers, including children, where both in discovery and in hearings, immigration status is made an issue where it has no relevancy. We're bearing on the rights of that victim.
8778	Gallagher	James	108	9Kkq97ccCr8	1294	1327	I think moving in the direction of really helping the working poor is important. And I think, Jessica, right? Your point of 70% of low income people are living in working homes, right? That is a travesty here in California. So, I think trying to work on something that hits that spot of we're really trying to help the working poor, which, when you first came to talk to me that really was the impetus of what we talked about. I think that makes a lot of sense.
8779	Monning	Bill	25	boBaH4nV9W8	241	254	I do want to offer a brief close that just addresses some of the information that's been put out today, the suggestion that all calories are equal is just not accurate.
8780	Leno	Mark	60	Q9LdqK3BIlI	377	398	what start off as very minor traffic fines with then, assessments that are about four times the expense of the fine itself. And it can double very quickly if it's not paid in a very timely fashion. And then licenses have been revoked, which, of course, makes it only more difficult for someone to get to work and be able to get out of the arrears.
8781	Stone	Jeff	26	Xps8YHyq2fA	1143	1152	I wanna make sure, and I don't know how we do this, but we're gonna discuss it later, that the savings that we're gonna have are not just gonna be thrown into the general fund.
8782	Gatto	Mike	46	uuwAxYppIw8	503	534	And Mr. Cooper I understand your points. I understand your experience. What we're gonna do, we were referring to the, to the general public the, the concept of turning a multi-thousand member police forces into. For lack of better word, drones that record every single face on the street. That's what we're referring to. I'm sure we can come up with a list working with you. Working with other people for exigent circumstances, riots and things like that. We did just hammer out this compromise. This is, this is yes, it's last minute.
8783	Beall	Jim	92	H96qDKzw-Aw	491	510	Yes, and just a question on the issue of going through the allocations and the equalization. Does this change any of the dollar amounts or reduce any of the dollar amounts that the school district, any of the school districts would receive?
8784	Monning	Bill	25	Htnfsa9QnRM	2158	2180	Because I think this would provide another index to measure that compliance, just because we have a law that says they have to review every year with stretch budgets and other priorities. I would be curious to know what the level of current compliance is. Thank you.
8785	Lara	Ricardo	107	Lkk9mVJ5y6k	413	433	Thank you. I just wanna again echo the concerns and comments from Senator Bloom. The love and hate relationship we have with DOGGR is the same one we have with DTSC. And I know that they're, we're working to improve the way DTSC and DOGGR do their business.
8786	Monning	Bill	25	w2OxGtfP7pQ	302	320	In 2014 alone, the Department of Fish and Wildlife removed over 135 dams or diversions in rivers and streams, found 340,000 pounds of trash and waste, and discovered close to 70 gallons of chemicals at marijuana growth sites.
8787	Chiu	David	7	crIzv1Rza90	1016	1026	Thank you. I want to first take a moment to thank the chairs for including this specific set of topics around alternative home ownership models. And I have a couple of questions to our community land trust experts.
8788	Pavley	Fran	104	aMmnutMx8lk	1974	1992	So two years to form the agencies, up to five years for the plans. Trying to consolidate that time period, providing technical assistance, even financial support for the plans are all good, anything we can do to accelerate that.
8789	Gomez	Jimmy	80	gmSplS1IxCE	484	499	And now we're on the brink of actually dealing with this problem after 20 long years. The lack of action has didn't just create problems for the state but created problems throughout every single community in California.
8790	Stone	Jeff	26	L-zMn7PZXCE	1438	1451	Have the highest level of professionals coming from a county because I came from a county as you know. And I believe in local control, but I also believe we need to look at the taxpayers that are struggling in this state. We have Prop 30 that might be coming to a conclusion soon.
8791	Nielsen	Jim	68	0J9n2c3eCds	1002	1021	Senator as I said in my opening it's kind of arbitrary as was the two acre feet, the ten acre feet. My comfort level just based as being a farmer, knowing how far that amount of water is going to go. You're not going to be a farmer with that kind of acreage other than if you do have a small organic farm
8792	McGuire	Mike	93	e-eay8FdlZA	1627	1640	And, it's just like anything in life, if you are not forced to comply, you have a lot of priorities that are coming at your during the day. On the mental health side, how do we ensure that these guidelines are enforced?
8793	Hertzberg	Robert	99	6r30p-6PJFA	463	477	And it seems to me that they boil down to four issues that I wanna briefly address. Some of which that were addressed in the amendments and some of which I wanna address as relates to the facts. First, I heard a great deal of concern about cost shifting.
8794	Dababneh	Matthew	50	Tq4qt4-wMzE	122	139	Once again, I really do want to stress, that this would affect around 12,000 seniors in our state who are medically needy only in residential facilities by simply allowing them to have $50 back a month, to be able to provide for the personal effects.
8795	Wood	Jim	72	7dMs8PMx4Kc	460	473	- And just a final question. If I missed this, I apologize. So, is there a summary of the overall cost of this entire incident and what it's cost our licensees and our departments?
8796	Stone	Jeff	26	MTWW-DN4Tdo	160	182	And then lastly, in our drug treatment centers I still believe that long term naltrexone is a very important tool to help those who really want to eliminate their addiction to opiates. And it is my hope that we see these restorations within the Medi-Cal program, Madam Chair.
8797	Cooley	Ken	45	maPB0VHfdFQ	1989	2003	Colleagues I rise today with a heavy heart to adjourn in memory for Wesley Stewart Simmons. It was remarked that I had a birthday last week and my good friend Wesley Stewart Simmons passed away on my birthday. He was age 69 he
8798	Cooley	Ken	45	maPB0VHfdFQ	2003	2022	had fought a long battle with Mylofibrosis and I just want to rise today in honor of him. He is survived by his wife Sandra they would have celebrated their fortieth anniversary this year. Two children David and Emily both married, three
8799	Hertzberg	Robert	99	iJc5cTYtc4Q	1518	1532	What we've done is now we've fiscalized land use. So all these edge cities around the big cities have automobile dealers. And so that they can get the extra revenue. If in fact we're selling new cars, why don't we just take that Bradley-Burns penny out of sales tax.
8800	Cooper	Jim	21	qEEp65rUcCA	592	621	State fair's coming up starting Friday, and the folks from the 290 unit, the Sexual Registry Unit will be out doing vehicles reading license plates because we have folks that show up to these events, you have a large number of children just like it's leap Rio. You have Disney on Ice or other children's events. We want to make sure folks are in compliance. So I think it's a good bill and it's a good piece of legislation. I want to remind folks out there, there are many good uses for LPR's. So, thank you, Senator.
8801	Gipson	Mike	28	SQe4IQVjZKc	1005	1029	This is the oversight Committee that has proved the budget, the audit has already went forward. This is oversight Committee regarding the budget that was, the audit that was done excuse me. Let's talk about next steps and what will be the follow-up from your department. And the expectation of the department's coming back to you.
8802	McCarty	Kevin	22	B6r57uGOz9Y	563	577	And with that we're gonna go back to item number one, the capital outlay issue and attempt to move that issue forward and close it out. Can I have a motion on item number one? Motion to second on that. Please call the roll.
8803	Mitchell	Holly	64	13FyHcfWoOM	1485	1499	So, again I hope that we continue the conversation and that we're clear about what our responsibilities are, today as well as longer-term planning. And with that I'll be supporting the measure today. Thank you.
8804	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	kvK2sg30nzk	695	715	I apologize, if you already spoke to this please forgive me. But all of this, I mean it's very important, and I agree it's so wonderful we don't have to keep clawing over whether or not we're seeing climate change. And what isn't wonderful is that The fact is that we're seeing it.
8805	Dodd	Bill	71	etnGLuiVGv4	1741	1757	Thank you Mr. Speaker I really appreciate that. It would ask for a moratorium on planned shutdowns of mail sorting centers and protect door-to-door delivery for all of our constituents. I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
8806	Hertzberg	Robert	99	gnd2v7Ro_Uo	702	722	Before you go Mr. Alejo some questions. Any others in opposition? Any others in opposition? Yeah, just real quickly. On, you can even have answered it in terms of having a discussion with the author with respect to the eminent domain piece. You, Mr. Selia, you believe that that's a critical element of making this thing work?
8807	Alejo	Luis	9	J0XgdYqFY4Y	563	574	it's not other states it's not just Ferguson, it's not just New York, these are issues that some of us have to deal with day-in-and-day-out and there's ongoing investigations
8808	Pavley	Fran	104	_QWOBYYvqfo	1404	1419	So, there's a lot of benefits. The challenge is is as we switch away from petroleum use, and diversify our fuel supply, and what we use to move around, the road maintenance thing comes into question.
8809	De Leon	Kevin	102	Gcdptg51L2I	956	972	So he succeeded in city government, rising to the position of mayor. Eventually came to Sacramento, where he became a very effective leader. Now Senator Huff Californians owe a great debt of gratitude to the to the cranky Diamond Bar planning department for denying your church expansion project.
8810	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	HL5dQ4Xf2nk	220	246	I will tell you that that was quite disconcerting to see that, and really felt like a tremendous invasion of privacy which is what sort of brought this issue to my personal attention. Now we know drones are already becoming popular and prevalent and it's time we began an important public conversation about their innovative uses as well as the challenges they pose to our long held values.
8811	Garcia	Cristina	112	3I7f3vKVAeA	1121	1132	Members, I rise in support of SB 350. I, like a lot of you, did not get everything I wanted or needed for my district in this bill, but I want to bring back to the local, to my district.
8812	Pan	Richard	96	n_QC4AsmdBs	200	217	I believe it's just announced today the largest racial ethinic group is now actually Latino, is now number one right now. And our state's continuing to become more diverse as well. And also we are a hub for people around the worl.
8813	Patterson	Jim	119	sR3YZBZSyxQ	1217	1239	Thank you, Mr. Speaker, members, Assembly Bill 483 was amended in the Senate to include chaptering out amendments and delayed the effective date at the request of the Department of Consumer Affairs, which we considered to be reasonable. This bill has received strong bipartisan support, passed every Committee, both houses unanimously and I ask, respectively for your aye vote.
8814	Roth	Richard	106	WgBOQU7UIHU	915	941	Well my concern of course would be that at some point, hopefully in the near future, we fix this immigration situation in a positive way. And then we have a group of young adults who missed the opportunity to do what the law requires, which is register for the selective service and the draft past the age limitation and then are denied subsequent benefits.
8815	Atkins	Toni	110	nhED5L0HREU	1757	1773	The session schedule is as follows: Monday, January 5, 2015 floor session at 12 noon sharp. Under adjourn in memories, Mr. Holden, you're recognized for the purpose of adjourn in memories.
8816	Eggman	Susan Talamantes	73	O1x83dZ-ZdA	445	467	But a lot of times don't even take it, just knowing it's there, knowing that if it gets too bad for them, that they have another option. If there is any indication of a mental disorder the attending physician may not prescribe the aid and dying drug until a mental health specialist has evaluated that individual. In addition to all these requirements a consulting physician must confirm,
8817	Bloom	Richard	2	c9Ojvyv2LI0	1281	1306	With respect to the beverage container recycling fund, a fun topic that we spent a lot of time on in our last session. Apparently, the timeline for when that fund goes upside down has been moved back by a year, and the Governor hasn't proposed any fixes for it, I think, in the current budget.
8818	Fuller	Jean	49	pnu4iUzw8JA	1030	1041	How can we can task them with gaining supply and delivery, and then and then give someone whose mission is just to not worry about that, the regulatory power over them?
8819	Bloom	Richard	2	D85P8H59LjQ	251	278	AB 974 authorizes the use of these bond proceeds but only if various criteria are met and these include that the projects must be consistent with the sustainable communities strategy adopted by the relevant metropolitan planning organization and there must be documented proof that two or more significant planning or implementation actions related to the project occurred on or before December thirty first twenty ten.
8820	Gallagher	James	108	dAMeavSqnLk	896	901	Mr. Speaker and members, unfortunately this is one of the bills we weren't able to work out in judiciary. I just have to rise in opposition to this. As an attorney, I've actually dealt with his exact situation and there's already current law that allows you go back to the court, I've done this for my clients myself.
8821	Mathis	Devon	75	_GNket01HEA	37	58	to continue to make available the services of neuropsychologists to those who suffer concussions and traumatic brain injuries in a work-related injury. This is an urgency bill because the division is currently in the process of adopting regulations to drop neuropsychologist as QMEs, meaning those who suffer
8822	Daly	Tom	118	Mfs9_24i5lo	1608	1626	Thank you, colleagues. Ten yes votes, the bill is onto the next step. Thank you, Mr. Chiu. Mr. Cooley, this is the best time for you to present your bill. Mr. Cooley's bill is AB 704 regarding escrow services.
8823	De Leon	Kevin	102	SU8_KAMcIaE	377	413	Obviously, for a whole variety of reasons, are disproportionally impacted by the short-lived, climate pollutants.  So, these are areas that, obviously, would stand to benefit from SB 535, which takes 25% of cap and trade auction revenues to mitigate, obviously, the public health impacts, you know, which I would assume that in the area that you govern from Kern County south, all the way to King's, Tulare, Fresno, Madera, Stanislaus you have a high impact of asthma rates in this area.
8824	Brown	Cheryl	13	m48b5iZN1Uo	385	400	Good morning. I'm so happy to be here today, and be a part of this. As a mother of a son, as a grandmother with two grandsons, it's wonderful to be here to talk about this subject.
8825	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	nJsCwYpjBcE	1094	1126	So, I'm with you on that. I just want to make sure. If you come to that eureka moment where we could put this somewhere, where it can be permanently in here, and then you can also help other people who are doing, what we call God's work, public safety officers, public officers, all them, where we can protect them all. Not just police officers. I would love to do that with you. That would be my only, "but" to try to try to work that out.
8826	Monning	Bill	25	Ml25eXE1TpQ	1356	1380	I think this was contained in your testimony, but just to be clear. The plan is to maintain MR MIP going forward even with having eliminated the denial for preexisting condition, which had been the, this had been the alternative for many. But there's a continued population for whom, they'll still be eligible for this?
8827	Chavez	Rocky	83	Skk_s7qoQEk	2079	2102	I'm sure it's a significant part of it. But when I look at it, if we're going to be defining the scope of practice, standardize curriculum, training standards, supervising standards and a certification protocol, if we start doing all these things, and a lot of people are supporting it going to be no longer able to do what they're doing and the good work they're doing.
8828	Stone	Jeff	26	NYGfzZLGLck	1865	1876	An American may get a tougher deal than a non-citizen, because there won't be immigration consequences considered. It's another example of asking to treat non-citizens better than our own citizens.
8829	Alejo	Luis	9	gP-mCxG_DCU	583	599	So this bill is a recognition that will-- nothing will be done at the federal level, then states like California who do recognize the value of immigrant labor and how important the agriculture industry, let us create a pilot program that will allow a lawful way for them to be employed and continue to contributing to a state like ours.
8830	Dodd	Bill	71	CD2KiD3xDgY	1564	1579	No, I have, I, I'm gonna say that I probably have something on the order of 22 school districts, maybe more, in my district, and we have sent out, and all the board members are on my list.
8831	Nguyen	Janet	65	vEySB-JPx9Q	1723	1735	As mentioned, both of my two children right now, four and two, are in daycare. One at eight months, starting at infant at eight months, the other one at six months.
8832	Hueso	Ben	48	Uhijp_1CdK4	1031	1041	To make sure that we're comfortable that this bill has all the proper reviews and oversight. And that people get an opportunity to weigh in at every level on this bill.
8833	Wood	Jim	72	Tqcxk8QJsXU	768	787	But nor is it fair to penalize providers who choose not to join in networks for a variety of reasons and yes one of those may be reimbursement, but the reality is different plans have different requirements and frankly some of them are just a pain to deal with and you don't want to do business with them. There is no incentive for the plans to warn patients about coverage. We just voted yesterday on SB 137 to provide adequate provider directories for consumers. There is a problem here.
8834	Beall	Jim	92	en7JgK3RrhY	1303	1321	And they need to have the opportunity to repair and replace and rehabilitate their equipment. Because if you don't do that, obviously we'll start to have a deterioration in the availability of transit for people in California.
8835	Stone	Jeff	26	9_Ipr5dyo2o	882	901	today are selling for much, much more. The state made the investment by allowing us to use the increment, and today the state is the beneficiary because the property taxes that are generated there are significant. I think it was very short-sighted to end redevelopment, but it is what it is.
8836	Bigelow	Frank	91	C-QK6WD4V0E	1030	1061	Could you see potentially some significant cost savings to drug addictions and the treatment of drug addictions that would be instead of that dollar spent there, you could be using that money over on the other side of the coin preventing those drugs from even getting in there. That's just one question, and at the end of the day there's no ramification for any of this happening, there's no punishment, there's no additionally added, so there's no slap on the hand, it doesn't appear. So how do we cover all the basis?
8837	Hertzberg	Robert	99	Y13vuRnCz5Y	597	614	But in analyzing this, you know, I do think that this notion that the Chair mentioned about oversight would be interesting to at least maybe include something about the some process over time to make sure that this really is going to wait is certainly a long record with respect to Oregon and the other states that have impose this.
8838	Rendon	Anthony	120	DE6Za__0TWg	157	181	Thank you. Thank you, all three of you, Ms. Palmer, Mr. Strumwasser, and Mr. O'Neil. Thank you very much, not only for being here today, but for the work that you've been doing on the PUC. I want to allow for public comment. Is there anyone present who would like to address the committee? We'll use that microphone right there.
8839	Stone	Jeff	26	JK2AAP7nJZs	1877	1913	Thank you madame President. I'm opposed to AB 1328. We know that in every profession, you know, whether it's medical doctors lawyers, podiatrists, engineers, CPAs, there's always a bad bunch. And a problem with the Legislature is we have a knee-jerk reaction to a lot of things that entice us to pass broad brush legislation.
8840	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	7f5uDPxTBXo	1411	1428	I am not amused that in my background material, from the staff of this Committee, under argument in opposition it states that, "additionally there's no similar felony punishment in California domestic violence protective order statute upon which GVRO was in part modeled."
8841	Pavley	Fran	104	9xlCmdTyLME	344	368	Briefly, because I'm breaking my own rule not to speak to stay here longer, but there's a variety of points of view on this. People that represent areas that lots of cattle on grange land, and then there's a lot of people very concerned about the overuse of antibiotics potentially in your food supply and the impacts of public consumption and how we treat it.
8842	Hill	Jerry	66	N-Bfbq4TmhI	1820	1841	So if that patient is not in that prescriber, that physician does not know what that drug is, that, a specific innovative, the specific biosimilar, the specific interchangeable biosimilar. If they did not know that, they wouldn't know where to go to find out exactly what that reaction was and how to, how to deal with that as it goes on. That's why the communication is so important.
8843	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	Oggr1OKYFzQ	2030	2047	Alright, five to two. That bill is out, thank you Senator Wieckowski. We have one last bill. Of Senator Allen's SB 775 which is a result of a letter sent by the Senator requesting that Zak Meyer-Krings?
8844	Hertzberg	Robert	99	qrLFVDrXadw	128	154	This is former assembly member Mike Fires advice. Any opposition to this measure? Any further. The bill's been moved by who? Who moved it? I'm sorry who moved it? Somebody that, oh, senator Beall moved it. Eloquent close. This is due pass. What are we looking at? File item number 14 AB due passed to the floor. Secretary, call the roll.
8845	De Leon	Kevin	102	I210RzVAPYs	730	754	We have a long way to go to add more slots as well as hopefully one day in the near future, actually increase those slots for these working families. Now, specifically, giving a seat to these child providers at the table in terms of organizing, this bill will strengthen child care and early education jobs by giving providers a seat at the table.
8846	Waldron	Marie	29	96m6mcmORow	465	503	Thank you Mr. Chair and Committee. Thank you. I am losing my voice as time goes on. Just briefly, AB59 streamlines the process for county to opt in to participate in assisting outpatient treatment. Assisted Outpatient Treatment is a program that helps assist family members and others to initiate the treatment for severely mentally ill adults who are incapable of seeking help on their own or have noncompliance with voluntary treatment, and who have a history of incarceration or hospitalization, who have threatened to hurt themselves or others.
8847	Levine	Marc	8	-f1YeZDeFao	533	545	We are very grateful for you being part of this, being engaged in this and being you know, working very hard on something that Californians throughout the state really care a whole lot about.
8848	Bloom	Richard	2	iVjsAvWHgB0	1268	1283	By not taking an action today, it doesn't mean that this, by any stretch of the imagination, that this is off the table. And I wanted also to thank all the advocates and coalitions that are helping to raise awareness around this very important issue.
8849	Hertzberg	Robert	99	RToDyZa8pHM	485	497	So, you know, these arguments I get the point that there's been this adjustment in the airline industry because of 9/11. But, you know, I just don't think you-- well, whatever, we'll get to that, any further in opposition? Yes.
8850	Cannella	Anthony	61	TzXQpLlHzt8	346	367	Rail, low-carbon transit and then, what we appropriate as the legislature, which would be perfect, of course. How much greenhouse gas, you think will be able to reduce?  Thats a lot of money; that's a lot of money that people are paying in the state too. Any estimates to correlate that between money paid and reduction in greenhouse gases?
8851	Bloom	Richard	2	ITEaoTWbk6c	869	892	The funding in the proposal before you today builds upon last year successes and the direction that the people of the State of California have given us and it addresses some of the critical short and long-term drought needs to make our infrastructure more resilient to the weather conditions we should expect to face with more regularity.
8852	Wolk	Lois	94	E5095nDqds4	1241	1259	Thank you very much. I wanna thank everyone for attending. I appreciate that, the experts that we had as well as the citizens who have stayed through the hearing and offered their testimony as well. And with that, I will adjourn the meeting.
8853	Fuller	Jean	49	A5ksLI96f9Q	1142	1170	I have one question. We found some information that there might be some out there that think that some of the group decisions lean heavily in favor of employees rather than employers. Tell me how you judge whether the decisions are fair and how you help others accept your decisions.
8854	Gray	Adam	27	nj31ZcgCRww	128	146	Okay, the consent calendar has been adopted. With that housekeeping and some additional housekeeping SB 151 has been pulled from today's agenda. Make note of that. And now we'll move to our regular business. We're taking bills in sign-in order today.
8855	Burke	Autumn	6	7KrRcZ9ORsY	1487	1504	And if I'm allowed to answer, like what was stated that if you are able to take Medi-Cal reimbursements, that is part of the requirement of those clinics which as you said is the reason that some of these notices to make an even level of playing field even in the private clinics is necessary.
8856	Huff	Bob	105	rEreViIPqP0	1250	1255	Thank you, Madame President. Sheep, ram, goat. I rise in support of this. Very similar to the resolution we did a couple of weeks ago. Many people want to know why do we do these recognitions. When I got elected to the Senate, the LA Times says we did the research.
8857	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	aKK8kwy-F68	6	31	Senate Judiciary Committee; the first thing I'd like to do is just give you an indication of how we're going to proceed today. We are having a special order of business where we are going to have File Item...File Item 3, SB 128 will be heard first.
8858	Bloom	Richard	2	1KGu-z0GNGc	1583	1606	I believe that, thinking back to the time when I was on the City Council, that I, actually, was asked to approve this vehicle being out on Main Street. And so, it is within, at least currently within the purview, to my understanding, within the purview of the city and the City Council to either allow it or not allow it.
8859	Gipson	Mike	28	rNW_uEjgPtM	951	970	That's another financial gain, in which an entity or individual that's on the school board, on this governing board can in fact receive. Two, this bill has been tried before. I believe that we're at a point now, and hopefully it passes out this committee with an aye recommendation.
8860	Leno	Mark	60	0sKrxcyZVQA	1718	1741	All right, we do have a motion for the Senate version and as we discussed, just a couple days ago. The Senate version recognized that Fresno County was granted a five year extension until June of 2020 so there is no immediacy to this. That is the reason for the motion. 3-0 on the Assembly side.
8861	Gaines	Ted	24	BvEiMZK1K8A	624	648	I join my colleagues Senator Nielsen and Assembly Members Gaines, Bigelow, and Dahle in honoring Mr. Beringer's accomplishments and bidding him a fond farewell as he embarks on a well earned retirement.
8862	Nielsen	Jim	68	b8mZhVlBtpE	1266	1290	I think that we all have great sympathy for childcare, I surely do myself. I remember the night when the game program was in this very room. And there was a dispute in childcare capital light play between myself as Senate Republican Leader and the Assembly Republican Leader. And the whole thing almost blew up. Over my figuring that it was an $18 million deal, and he thought it was nine.
8863	Wieckowski	Bob	55	dWQgHfO0lk4	65	91	Furthermore, drought conditions and increased temperatures can facilitate the spread of disease such as the West Nile virus, cases of which doubled in California last year, because of higher temperatures, and even small pools of stagnant water led to increased virus production, and populations of mosquitos that spread it.
8864	Wood	Jim	72	fnhJHfsu-gk	425	439	And yet you have those basic preventive services. That access that you're losing is a critical part of this as well. So it does affect it does truly affect everybody. It is not just the Medi-Cal population.
8865	Wieckowski	Bob	55	z7GYIGDOm-s	276	286	And I read that the only state that doesn't have it, but give me some data that you'll be giving to the administration so that we can make a decision.
8866	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	xbFtMrlj2T4	1412	1423	The beauty of being able to carry this bill, right? But individuals who have been trying to find any way, and some of them have been frustrated and just said, forget it, I'm doing it, are being fined daily for it.
8867	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	IKESHE_NOXc	1394	1422	Under second reading, file item number one. That was that was one reported, under Governors appointments item number five. Senator De Leon, you may take a moment that's fine. Item number five colleagues, Senator De Leon?
8868	Cooley	Ken	45	ufpnr2TGLO8	1000	1017	And then with a view to kids, think about, if we had the chance to reshuffle the deck a little bit, to reconceptualize how this all works, to get the best possible outcome for kids, that's really our job. And we may not arrive at a conclusion at the end of today's hearing.
8869	Mitchell	Holly	64	2tOIPOStcDA	1434	1455	And not the actual total numbers of appeals across schools that experience math misplacement in a given year. The Silicon Valley Community Foundation surveyed the 22 school districts that currently have or are in the process of implementing math misplacement policies And the highest cost for implementation reported was no more than $8,800.
8870	Kim	Young	82	tDRy7O_NObM	74	88	Well, thank you very much for your presentation. I too would be very much interested in keeping updated on the SB 5 extension legislation and the  TPP, the Transpacific
8871	Gordon	Richard	117	elRk6CudldM	240	255	The fund would also assist city attorneys and the county district attorneys in investigating and prosecuting bail cases, which would help improve the state of bail in California for consumers in need of this vital service. The bill would also provide accountability on the funds collected.
8872	Gomez	Jimmy	80	11yyICoQ5m8	92	102	More incomes, right? But then, what you actually look at for care claims. You have more women taking time off to actually care for a sick child or a relative.
8873	Hertzberg	Robert	99	Q5Q2oc0ttio	379	393	And just with respect to the suggested clarification, we'll talk about it but with respect to the DA waitlist. I just, I just think that it's really more of a clarification because the current waitlist really hasn't been touched since the end of 2012.
8874	Ting	Philip	30	5fJ7Ysn9i88	1585	1602	We really look forward to working with the committee going into May revise. We feel like we've had some great discussions with Department of Finance and the administration, as well as with all of you, and look forward to continuing to ensure that the K-12 adult education in particular is stabilized in this proposal going forward.
8875	Liu	Carol	63	w2OxGtfP7pQ	718	734	Some found navigating the process with a pre-existing medical condition to be far more difficult than necessary. So with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, expansion of Medi-Cal, and the effort to dramatically reduce the inmate population,
8876	Leyva	Connie	62	7E5hMfSVPig	344	356	You are obviously a very smart individual. However, as I told you when we met, you are in a position where you are going to be at some point or somewhat paying for the sins of the past.
8877	Quirk	Bill	23	dv1TuQD9iKk	507	523	This morning, we heard from the first panel that essentially we have no records on police use of force. We have no records on the racial aspects of this. We have nothing.
8878	Hueso	Ben	48	90yWX-I7oeQ	928	941	And Scott Wetch, representing the United Steel workers in the California State Association of electrical workers of California state pipe trades council western states council of sheet metal workers.
8879	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	6gxr39Gyjlk	1674	1696	The California maritime and goods movement industry has worked diligently to meet state emission and energy efficiency standards. The port of Long Beach, for example, is now in completion of more than $185 million worth of shore to power infrastructure while the port of Oakland is undertaking at a cost of $85 million an upgrade to their dock side power hook-ups.
8880	Lara	Ricardo	107	ptq5V1Fu0ok	672	694	The next item is AB 1390, ground water adjudication. Do pass as amended, per author, to specify notice requirement, add disclosure requirements to property owners, delete the ability of the state to intervene, and make contingent on enactment of SB 226. Roll call vote. Secretary, please call the roll.
8881	Atkins	Toni	110	ytuWCZu3NdM	513	549	You know, as the Assembly's fiscal officer, Gus served as the green carpets green eye shade longer than anyone else, 35 years, and it hasn't always been easy guests had to basically reshape the house after voters approved Proposition 140 in 1990. He had the job of representing the Assembly before the citizens compensation Committee. We have a lot to thank him for. He helped the assembly whether the great recession in a way that left our fiscal house in order while allowing us to support vital programs for the people of California.
8882	Rendon	Anthony	120	a4X1msw4NL8	1771	1791	Thank you Mr. Speaker. AB 1023 codifies provisions of the California public utilities commission's policy and includes communications that occur between high-level CPUC personnel including commissioners and expands the reporting to include quasi legislative proceedings, advice letters, and scoping memos.
8883	Wolk	Lois	94	IyL6hnUxBjA	525	535	Alright, thank you. I just have a couple more questions. You know my district. My district is always looking for alternatives to the IOUs, [UNKNOWN] Star. Whether it's community choice aggregation, renewables, energy efficiency distributed generation and the cutting edge which is often the bleeding edge but that's the district I represent.
8884	Allen	Benjamin	70	MwU2rlmXSqg	616	629	No, that's okay. I, I was, I was taken, struck by the, the comment that was made by Mr. Bingham, and I just want to get a better sense, I mean. How, so how, how is a veteran's home eligibility determined?
8885	Brown	Cheryl	13	7OpOOjWDpas	319	339	I think that's why I was asking the question about the experience earlier. What do you need for experience? And it sounds like there's some kind of disconnect because we understand experience was one thing, and you're coming back with all this experience but it's not being counted.
8886	Fuller	Jean	49	GhElfEb6QxY	821	831	Since I know you told me you sit in and watch the cases, and I know you do a lot of training, but I didn't think to ask you this last question.
8887	Atkins	Toni	110	23L8yaBtAnI	1800	1812	Our house of origin deadline. Next will be the budget and then the end of session and it'll be before us before we know, it will be upon us before we can even believe that it is come
8888	Bloom	Richard	2	C5FKcnZ9gio	100	116	For every 10% increase in the price of a pack of cigarettes, there's a 4% reduction in overall cigarette consumption and a 6.5% reduction in youth consumption. And this is one of the reasons why this bill is so important, young people.
8889	Fuller	Jean	49	GhElfEb6QxY	805	821	While I appreciated all the answers to all the questions we put to you before you came today, and I just have two more. And one is, we didn't get to touch on, how do you assess the level and the type of training needed to be an Administrative Law judge?
8890	Bloom	Richard	2	C5FKcnZ9gio	146	168	I think it's an important point that we're not there yet. 16% of high school students are addicted to cigarettes and one in four use some form of tobacco. Though there's widespread education on the dangers of tobacco, availability and deceptive marketing continues to lure our youth to try these dangerous products.
8891	McCarty	Kevin	22	d0K-gu5-iM8	1276	1290	The first question is you know-- certainly we know what the overall facts are. That there's a great need for adult ed in California, we estimated five thousand people in our state at least, that could benefit from the services.
8892	Lara	Ricardo	107	_NTagRCFfsc	947	957	There's been instances in my district where a couple of cafeteria workers have either been fired or castigated for leaving food out so that kids can actually take it home.
8893	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	-Bv1QTsnUc8	1341	1356	AB 224 requires the state department of education in consultation with the California foster youth education task force to develop a standardized notice of education rights for foster children, and to post the notice on this Internet website.
8894	Allen	Benjamin	70	1DOcolDqpAw	850	868	I guess, I suppose this article is deeply flawed, but it does touch upon this issue and says that "the data that oil companies reported to state regulators "probably do not account for the full extent "of benzene present in fracking flowback.
8895	Salas	Rudy	34	h6unjkXLW0o	419	434	Thank you, now I had a couple of general questions overall cause I know this legislature back in March allocated close to a billion dollars for drought response and emergency drought resistance.
8896	McGuire	Mike	93	GIcgVGMKBjg	1783	1816	These devastating, illegal trespass grows, many on state and federal lands are literally drying at Northern California rivers. Last summer was the first year in written record that the Eel River and Matolle ran dry. The reason being is the state's historic drought, as well as hundreds of thousands, hundreds of thousands of illegally planted marijuana plants in Northern California watersheds.
8897	Nielsen	Jim	68	fMvnlUAhyII	112	122	I know you asked David. But I'm going to jump in here and not use my manners right now. Because really what I think , is that we're not so very far apart from each other.
8898	Nielsen	Jim	68	zPn0btnMxJg	788	798	Well Mr. Stephens, I want to thank you for that noble effort. I spent many, many years as Chairman of the Board of prison terms. I've looked this upfront and personal, by the tens of thousands.
8899	Hernandez	Ed	103	zrGTvYeF0_s	50	81	Even though it's going to be, not until 2016 that it sunsets, I believe that it is extremely important that we deal and have a resolution this year. I am committed, I believe the administration is committed, and I hope, and I think the leadership is committed to make sure that that is possible as well. The Governor has proposed a new tiered MCO tax structure. Legislation has been introduced in the Assembly to create a flat tax structure.
8900	Baker	Catharine	74	9fvwP7KwrvY	1470	1487	That has looked at this particular individuals qualifications and decided for this practice and this patient population it's served by that office, that this particular NP is appropriate to do these particular things. And so I find more comfort that there is still that relationship.
8901	Stone	Jeff	26	aYmlFd2X1yI	1199	1218	I hope so. We've got a lot of chambers that I recognize. The chambers are opposed and the California chambers are opposed. There must be an impact on business that isn't being addressed. So I hope you continue to work with these chambers, but in this present form I can't support the bill.
8902	McGuire	Mike	93	MpQ4SGzO7GE	917	927	We, we have offered a, anytime they wanna meet, we are willing to sit down. We'll sit down 6 a.m. Or midnight, whatever works, at a coffee house or at, at-
8903	Chiu	David	7	tI-QOGtgDxM	85	99	housing units to be built for the same level of our state funds. This bill has received significant bipartisan support and with that I respectfully ask for your aye vote and request transmittal to the Senate.
8904	Wolk	Lois	94	BllaAgaiebY	47	84	Did I, what did I say? I said eleven, that's no good. Thank you. Please do that again. Once again, the items that we will do first, one, two, four, five, six, eight, nine, ten, and twelve. And then separately three, seven, eleven, and thirteen. All right, welcome Senator Nielson, we will do the first set of items is there a motion?
8905	Grove	Shannon	77	uSmu0VlTZFk	97	111	We all know this isn't happening within the state's developmental centers and I'm glad that Governor Brown and the Administration have set closure dates for the developmental centers and because of that, I don't want to focus on how badly the DCs have been operated for years.
8906	Mitchell	Holly	64	yLe3bHZ0qDA	837	850	There are processes that they can engage in to do mid year adjustments to funding, but it was never in my expectation when I looked at the proposal that it was to provide full services to all those in need.
8907	Weber	Shirley	44	WBiuNzDlh60	392	409	Funding is the least of our concern when it comes to this because it's under part 98, but in addition to that, ya know, the option for parents to still homeschool their kids, if that's what they're doing, under the guidance of the school board, they can do that. And if they do that and things are at a level that
8908	De Leon	Kevin	102	OIbMOKdbCjk	1395	1410	If I'm not, we will get you that information today at 3 o'clock. Again Connor 13 years of age, last week Tuesday. Not of a long illness, this is completely unexpected.
8909	Hernandez	Roger	37	mRtWZWKaAFE	429	446	You talked about the systems that you rely on are looking to move away from the less competitive models and the old ways of doing business. So tell me about how the Department of Justice background check.
8910	Levine	Marc	8	h0wii6afZCs	1871	1885	If I have a sense of how many people want to speak I can get a sense of if I can give you fifteen minutes a piece or something less. I'm kidding about fifteen minutes or something a little bit more manageable so everyone gets a chance to talk.
8911	Nielsen	Jim	68	GIcgVGMKBjg	1473	1501	It's getting hard enough to produce in the State of California now, ladies and gentlemen, for California agriculture. And in our communities, we have to keep in mind we need food. We need water, and we need food and by constraining our ability to have water, we're constraining our ability to provide for our grandchildren.
8912	Block	Marty	59	AuGnonUgy28	368	385	Thank you. Okay, with that, we will move on to item 13, and I think I will do this procedurally. We'll review the senate plan for UC and CSU and either adopt or not adopt it.
8913	Melendez	Melissa	41	iVjsAvWHgB0	1146	1162	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Well, we've had a lot of discussion outside of this conference hearing about this particular community, and as I'm sure everyone is aware in this committee, this particular group has been very vocal.
8914	Wood	Jim	72	0uNprUHid34	64	76	This was intended to clarify with the district, that the district did not have the authority to sell sovereign trade tide and submerged lands. However the restriction already exists not only in the state constitution but in common law as well.
8915	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	dgExrfYqkjM	457	482	Both CalRecycle, which is an agency I think that's done a fairly good job, and the state auditor have called for the elimination of processing fee offsets as the best way to make the bottle bill program sustainable, and to increase recycling by essentially making manufacturers feel the full cost of using materials that are not readily recyclable.
8916	Quirk	Bill	23	i3P-QI4InjM	1699	1716	The problem then arises, when they do everything when it's deemed approved and people still take time and that's what we're concerned about. But everything that a city, a county could ask for today. They can ask for, and that will stop the shot clock.
8917	Lara	Ricardo	107	23IlHVpz85o	1098	1104	Thank you. Again, we're just gonna remind the witnesses to stick to the fiscal components of the measure. We don't want to rehash the policy arguments. Okay? Go ahead.
8918	Daly	Tom	118	NEf6zh-NPIY	6	32	I'd like to welcome everyone to the Assembly insurance Committee hearing. This is our first of the current session. I think we're close to having a quorum. We have a quorum now and because we have a quorum I think we'll go ahead and take roll at this point.
8919	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	FVQ4YG_BqFE	650	661	It's my understanding we've come to a compromise on all of their issues with only one minor issue outstanding. And at the earliest opportunity, I will amend the bill to reflect this compromise.
8920	Liu	Carol	63	2ZjsVXuo_n0	1572	1584	And we'll see you next -- we'll have a spring break, and when we come back, I think we have over 24 bills set. So this is ten today, ten bills today.
8921	Cannella	Anthony	61	-1v9avmnxCY	496	502	Yeah, just a quick, you know, my original, when I looked at this, I thought look, if people wanna buy or rent a place without parking that's their prerogative.
8922	Rodriguez	Freddie	69	eYvHQ6iO6CE	2253	2267	And the ways we can expand them and have that accessibility throughout all Californians, throughout California. It's, it's greatly needed. So once again, I want to thank the author for bringing it forward. Look forward to working with you and also as a co-author at that, thank you very much for bringing this bill forward. Thank you.
8923	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	5jUUOwMdhxk	945	959	Whether they work at a small business or a big business. Whether they work on a farm or in a restaurant or a retail establishment. I think that's an important value, an important value for the State of California and for us as Americans, quite frankly.
8924	Chang	Ling Ling	18	FMt4j4ajPsQ	25	37	In order to meet the growing demand for skilled and knowledgeable employees in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, it is necessary for California to ensure access to STEM courses as early in the student's career as possible.
8925	Hill	Jerry	66	9xlCmdTyLME	1382	1398	It's my goal to get to a solution. It's imperative that we find a solution to this and just as we saw on April 17th of this year, one person lost their life, four others still hospitalized. This is something that we need to resolve. This bill will get us there. I ask for your aye vote.
8926	Chang	Ling Ling	18	i1dEPEL80sQ	818	837	Right. Sorry there was a similar bill SB 312 by Romero that was requiring the State Board of Education's, the Allocation Board to also provide live video and that the costs are minor and absorbable/minimal and that's key.
8927	Bonta	Rob	85	merVIEmEWtA	1215	1237	Now, if you take a more holistic, more comprehensive approach are there set offs that you can actually place against that cost in terms of savings to the state as we're lifting people out of poverty and encouraging work? Are we actually saving on any programs that are provided to our poorest Californians?
8928	Stone	Jeff	26	cxFa18iFwgA	1381	1398	Sometimes the problems so pervasive we can't even solve it anymore. So a couple of observations. One I'm looking at this core staffing formula allocation, and by your own admissions here today, it hasn't been updated since 1991.
8929	Hernandez	Roger	37	_x7-b1Y1JBM	501	520	This bill only applies to schools that are run by for profit institutes or organizations. When the opposition spoke before us here today, they made it very clear that they don't only operate in California. That they operate in 2000 schools throughout 36 states.
8930	Liu	Carol	63	HutoDdelxCc	1409	1447	SB 118. This regards school-based health and education partnership programs. School based health centers are locally designed to meet specific needs of the student population. Centers serve students directly or through referral to an appropriate community provider. The public health center support program has existed in state statute for eight years. That has never been funded. Our centers have relied on federal funds, another federal fund project and community support to provide a range of services such as routine physical health, oral health, and mental health services.
8931	Chavez	Rocky	83	mh8x9kvohEc	482	502	So, could we do the... I'll make this an ongoing revenue stream, looking to the staff for advice. Not looking for an ongoing revenue stream forever, but put a requirement to come back either three to five years to see the status of it.
8932	De Leon	Kevin	102	P8iQl0Ig1eQ	1700	1722	83%, that's an atrocious number. We have to make sure we can meet our objective by getting these hard-earned wages into the pockets of these working families. And do so in a manner that hopefully is not either a, owner is cumbersome, or b, applied in an overzealous manner. So we're trying to be very strategic and surgical.
8933	Medina	Jose	81	8ZmrJUXXU4k	816	826	And that as it looks for efficiency, maybe it should look elsewhere than rather the lowest paid workers. And for that reason I'm in support of this bill, this morning.
8934	Beall	Jim	92	ckv1hzYbS0w	1736	1750	If it is possible to have a breakthrough on that, traditionally infrastructures is kind of a bipartisan thing in Congress, you know, that's the way they work it usually.
8935	Runner	Sharon	4656	oXNKeIzrJ6c	786	817	So I'm sorry I won't be able to support this because I see it as a mandate and a categorical that you'll have to go to appropriation to figure out where to get that money as well. But, I think that program is a great program, it's a priority for that school district, I still support the local control of that money and not making the state pay even more for that program to be in all the schools. Thank you.
8936	Cannella	Anthony	61	LVzFkfmZq9U	577	589	I think that sets a pretty stiff penalty and it would hopefully detour, detour behavior, but with an open-ended amount, as is currently said the bill, I won't be able to support it, so if you would consider that.
8937	Waldron	Marie	29	X-EMNVy0KVE	1615	1648	Thank you, Mr. Chair, in my former life I actually, when I was on the city council, participated as a member of the San Diego County oxy taskforce. Which came out, oh gosh, eight nine years ago or so. And at the time, you know, all we kept hearing about was gosh, this, issue with the young people abusing opioid drugs and, prescription drugs is happening in the East Coast, but is coming here, and we better be ready.
8938	Beall	Jim	92	ajUtne5r3JM	7	42	Thank you. There in the discussion of the cap and trade program, and you peripherally mentioned this, do you think that, if we had, such a program for the cap and trade program coupled with the ability to do full-funding grant agreements, similar to the federal process, and I've, I've introduced a bill that allows this,
8939	Chiu	David	7	7KrRcZ9ORsY	867	885	There are certainly many heartfelt perspectives on both sides of this issue and I very much respect the various perspectives that we have and certainly my guess, Mr. Gallagher and I we may respectfully disagree on this particularly as we look at the constitutional issues but I just want to appreciate the conversation here.
8940	Nielsen	Jim	68	doJlNdYlHmM	1079	1103	these situations is not again unlike the air traffic controllers. These enormous ships with enormous loads and down in the bay, that turning basin is pretty small, compared to what they have to deal with. And being in the wheel house, watching what goes on,
8941	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	jMfO9319uXo	252	272	So if you folks would step up and join us and we've got about ten minutes for each of you and hopefully you're able to provide us with your thoughts.
8942	Stone	Jeff	26	Lv2k4fcWClc	727	744	Thank you Madam Chair. I want to just applaud Assemblyman Cooper for bringing this forward. I think this is a common sense approach to doing what we can I think to even address the Chair's concern to give these kids the best outcomes that we possibly can so they don't recidivate back.
8943	Baker	Catharine	74	BbpWOgfWUd0	2073	2102	I with regard to your last statement, I just, looking at section two subsection 92611.3 and it just says "as a condition of receipt of state funding UC shall not pay employers or officers salaries that exceed five hundred-thousand-dollars" and you're saying that the bill says you can do that is long as that money comes from private sources, so I don't see the language in the bill that makes that the case unless a misunderstanding what you're referring to.
8944	Wieckowski	Bob	55	WSuppHjpCKY	1280	1291	In a bankruptcy situation, you're selling assets, but the public policy is supposed to say, we're here saying the public policies that we want to protect people's homes because we encourage home ownership.
8945	Obernolte	Jay	86	VsFc4cEmvwc	234	254	We have integration of different resource types. Where we might be able to substitute renewable energy where we might have to curtail here for maybe conventionally powered power plants in other parts of the west. And then the third was the climatological differences where it might be cloudy here and sunny somewhere else or the wind might be blowing.
8946	Nielsen	Jim	68	gEGAX3Ud9_I	193	216	Ida wouldn't suggested anything that we're discussing today is a huge moment but we'll discuss it. Butuh, one of the things that is important is to see where agencies are on their strategic plans. I got to be a part of that many, many years ago when Governor Wilson first announced that we would do strategic planning.
8947	Obernolte	Jay	86	VsFc4cEmvwc	274	290	So, I would think that that particular advantage of regional coordination goes away after a new years, doesn't it, as more and more renewables come online there and have exactly the same problem we have.
8948	Wieckowski	Bob	55	2Dc5I9_7zFA	2231	2248	And the courage that you have brought today by bringing this matter and putting it on the tabl,e so that the city councils throughout the state of California Get the message, that we need to go forward and stop playing games on the parking requirement, cuz we're all familiar with it. I want to move the bill.
8949	Roth	Richard	106	mtOf4NbcKRw	401	428	And then I have another question on the TAPS program, again slightly off point since we're talking about CSOs, but it's my understanding, however inaccurate, that one of the problems in California is that the transition programs that active installations of which we have most of, to the extent we have any in the state anymore are populated by Federal government officials.
8950	Leno	Mark	60	0ONi8JCQxHk	288	315	Clearly this is a district bill. Let me repeat that, a district bill. It will impact only the constituents in my district, none of yours, nobody else in the state. The reason I have introduced this bill, and my mayor of San Francisco, Edwin Lee, is by my side today, he is the sponsor of the bill, because of a crisis in our city, a really serious crisis in our city.
8951	Roth	Richard	106	mtOf4NbcKRw	358	380	Because in fact the state is doing the Federal government's job in cleaning up a backlog in the Disability Claims Centers. Now I personally had a conversation with one of our Congressional delegation, with a US DVA representative on the phone and they did not, at that level, seem opposed to the concept. So my question is this.
8952	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	kMP7GilTLLE	52	71	They are indeed. Thank you, Mr. Chair, members; this is SB 358, which will revise California's Equal Pay act. I accept the amendments represented in the mockup that have before you. I could go through in great detail the fact that we have a significant gender gap in the state; women making 84 cents for every dollar a white man makes; African-American women, 58 cents; and Latinas 44 cents.
8953	Runner	Sharon	4656	g1KhSxf2FKA	201	230	Again LA County is so large that they don't wanna let go of the tax base which we really could have. I mean we have a mountain range between the end of Lothaly and Los Angeles. So I mean every services whether it is a veteran's services, that the county provides, we have to put our veterans on a bus or help them get down to the county hospitals, and they won't.
8954	Lara	Ricardo	107	CfbKdUW5Buw	2248	2267	Perfect. I'm going to have, this is not my bill. I'm going to have Kip, I'm going to have Kip attempt to answer the Chair's question and Senator Leno's question. And then I'll just bring it all together with glitter and pizazz.
8955	Maienschein	Brian	84	2HmztWZsIt4	1013	1023	Hold on a second Mr. Noteware. Just a quick reminder, name, organization only please because we've filled the time, the committee's time with the witnesses up here. You may proceed Mr. Noteware.
8956	Chiu	David	7	KEeiqVKf9vU	458	470	And I particularly want to thank my joint author, Speaker Tony Atkins, who has been a lifelong champion for affordable housing. Colleagues, I ask for your support of AB35, thank you.
8957	Hernandez	Ed	103	R5jZe-4pYBI	1499	1523	However, let me just kind of stress some of the concerns that I have with the way it's currently written, unless you are willing to take some of the Chair's amendments. So the problem is that under standards of protocol physicians don't want to associate with nurse midwives and I get it cuz of the liability issue.
8958	Pan	Richard	96	hnhklV-igrA	1720	1738	What's new is that this last outbreak didn't stop at Disneyland. It spread into other parts of California and to other parts of the United States, even into Canada and a couple of cases in Mexico. That is why we're doing this bill because we are...our herd immunity or community immunity has been declining and that's why the outbreak has been able to spread.
8959	Wilk	Scott	19	pY9wY6wExdc	488	513	I think that we need to do anything possible to safeguard these people. I think at the end of the day it's an imperative that we do protect our senior citizens. With me today is Mr. Gerald Richards from the California Senior Legislature. I also had scheduled Mr. Neal O'Farrell from the Identity Theft Counsel. Unfortunately, he's stuck on the freeway coming here from Walnut Creek, but I'd like to turn it over to Mr. Richards.
8960	Gomez	Jimmy	80	11yyICoQ5m8	1217	1227	First and foremost, the first question was should there be a bifurcated program, right? Should there be a difference between SDI, and there should be a difference between paid family leave.
8961	Eggman	Susan Talamantes	73	CVBfShlBh9U	96	107	And finally, this bill would require the 5150 Custody Form to record whether the historical course of a person's mental health was considered. We have witnesses here in support.
8962	Holden	Chris	78	wHWtVoyVLd0	955	978	Well, I think certainly, all I can say is life happens. And we are doing our best to try to recognize real situations that happen to people who are on jobs who are finding themselves debilitated because of the work accident.
8963	Pavley	Fran	104	tz0avG0I2sM	48	54	Is there permissible given recent court decisions that some money could be expended on those investing in the technology breakthroughs that we're going to need that'll be good for business and the long-run?
8964	Wolk	Lois	94	9Tz8V7yYUic	307	331	So I am a strong proponent of vaccinations. I'll conclude by saying, I think our individual rights aren't limitless. They aren't without limits. There is no such thing as an absolute individual right for anything that I can think of.
8965	Stone	Jeff	26	nfRac3nHOas	1238	1254	I think the crime rate is going up. And what is the impact of these federal kicks in skewing the results? And then I appreciate all the measures that you have here today but I don't see number six, you know, recidivism highlighted here.
8966	Burke	Autumn	6	hGRwdCC6_e8	559	598	Currently the state has a number of IT projects under development that are reported to cost more than 4 Billion dollars. AB 522 will allow the state to evaluate how well contractor performed on his IT projects by creating a contractor performance assessment reporting system. The data that is collected through the performance assessment on the contractors will then be taken into consideration acceleration in the evaluation and awarding of any future state IT projects. Using the state available tool to ensure vendor quality but also do make sure that California has an accurate picture of the vendor at vendoring into a contract wihat. This is a common sense measure that received by person support and both policy and the school communities, I respectively ask for your aye votes.
8967	Leno	Mark	60	kvK2sg30nzk	256	280	And that's what Senator Pavley has been all about for that past 15 years and what our SB 350 really is about and making sure that we stop the bleeding before we get to the fact that we need to take care of all the changes that are before us.
8968	Stone	Mark	20	csda2pMKJRU	1492	1502	That's not relevant to the con, conversation right now, but we'll talk about that, I'm happy to actually. Any other questions or comments? All right, I see none. Mr. Hadley, you may close.
8969	Hill	Jerry	66	L9_yK97Q24w	151	168	Here in California very few local agencies that use the technology have policies. And very few provide an opportunity for public input when approving the use of license plate readers. Out of the 57 local agencies known to use license plate readers only 16 have a public available policy.
8970	Quirk	Bill	23	Hfoe3X0tet8	1604	1624	With many of these entities already meeting on an adhoc basis, AB 33 would increase coordination, give specific direction to the council and ensure that these agencies take into account both cost effectiveness and technical feasibility when conducting their analysis.
8971	Bonta	Rob	85	q7LT4HnI37Y	103	126	So just kind of wanna figure out what's not being prioritized so we can be real clear about that. And then finally, I went back and I looked at health and safety code section 1279.2, which says that an investigation is opened up in, I think it's 2 days, 48 hours, and then an investigation must be complete in 45 days.
8972	Bonta	Rob	85	q7LT4HnI37Y	148	169	then three years later the fines are being levied, and so you have staff turnover, you have, maybe some of the relevant documents aren't so readily accessible, maybe memories fade. For institutions that have made a mistake and are willing to accept responsibility,
8973	Lara	Ricardo	107	gXZO0cZqlQg	175	189	Mendoza here. Perfect. We will begin with Assemblymember Linder, who was here on time I might add. Thank you Oh, I know but ... We reward timeliness in this committee.
8974	Pavley	Fran	104	GeGPm9PK4o0	319	339	I think you've had time to organize your, yeah, organize your PowerPoint presentation but before you start, Dr. Feinstein, I'd like to open it up to see if there are any opening comments by members, from either house. Let me welcome Assembly Member Jim Wood, Senator Lois Wolk,
8975	Pavley	Fran	104	GeGPm9PK4o0	304	319	And also we'll be focusing a little bit on the data gaps and what information we do need to make better informed decisions. And at the end of the day, it's all about protecting the ground water. So, let us begin with our first presentation.
8976	Mendoza	Tony	52	5EeaivfMcyY	221	242	If they are ethical stewards and technological innovators as they claim, they should have nothing to worry about SB 270. The goal of SB 270 is to provide the CRB with additional tools, so that they won't rely on increasing fees of the 700 licensed shorthand reporters who generally follow these rules.
8977	Pavley	Fran	104	b4USpkALPiM	195	221	SB 32 purposely isn't prescriptive. It doesn't have all those policies embedded either past or future, you guys that are gonna be around for 10 or 12 years have the ability to refine, modify, add to, as technologies become available, or as the economy changes. It provides that flexibility in meeting those different changing conditions.
8978	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	QkQlxH8U7IE	27	51	The following items have been pulled from today's agenda and so they will not be heard. File item 7, AB 459 by Assemblymember Daly has been pulled. File item 30, AB 1383 by Assemblymember Jones has been pulled. And file item 33 AB 1520 by the Committee on the Judiciary has been pulled.
8979	De Leon	Kevin	102	bkbYI6-vC30	53	67	You up for Director of the Department of Consumer Affairs so. If there anyone you would like to introduce, please do so and please begin with a statement as well.
8980	Hertzberg	Robert	99	cvDmVx__4xs	233	240	 I would ask the Board of Equalization member sitting in front of you. She's both, in both in the legislature and now she serves in that branch of government. Ask her.
8981	De Leon	Kevin	102	Fi4W0LVlb68	536	552	Contingent on the members, they may ask a very specific question, they may apply it to all individuals, it may be an open ended questions whereas you have an opportunity to answer if in fact you wish to do so or the members can subsequently may direct their questions. Why don't we start with Ms. Mitchell.
8982	Beall	Jim	92	FsWgeFm-Dtc	213	240	Well, in my district we just had another multi-million dollar settlement on child abuse in schools and I think training may be a wise thing to prevent these kinds of lawsuits so that would save taxpayer money from that standpoint. Not to mention it's good for policy, but I just wanted to point that out.
8983	Leno	Mark	60	07ilphfHuEw	1323	1341	The steps we've taken in these MOU's finally addresses it and it will be resolved over a 30 year period because of what the Governor has been able to negotiate with these two bargaining units for the first-time ever, extending the vesting period that's not happened before.
8984	Liu	Carol	63	tC7sJemEjBU	503	523	Thank you. There's one other question on page four of the analysis. It says that, we just asked because if we adopt this, there is two distinct authorities for JOC, either L.A. Unified or everybody else.
8985	Low	Evan	11	sA6uJxeRGKk	1163	1173	Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker and members. I'm delighted to present Assembly Bill 578 which is a simple measure that brings transparency to the Cal OSHA standards board.
8986	Hill	Jerry	66	cwCFlp-Kh9Y	1759	1772	I've got a number of, few questions related to safety that I just wanted to kind of get out there and see if we can get some responses as we move forward because I think the intent is to do the right thing, you know, and that's comfortable, and I'm comfortable with that.
8987	Williams	Das	12	ROiUoxqGjEc	715	729	Sure. Just want to note that the tipping fee, the state tipping fee is a buck 40. The typical amount that someone pays for disposal at a landfill in this state is 30 to $80 per ton. This is both per ton.
8988	Gomez	Jimmy	80	tC7sJemEjBU	481	495	And for everybody to understand, it doesn't matter who gives us a failing grade on our report cards, we make our own decisions based on the best interest of the people of California, and I don't think that any of us take that into account when deciding a vote so.
8989	Hill	Jerry	66	4HBwd3okHJI	298	310	Sure. But I think most of us have had our teeth cleaned, if not worked on, and we know those sharp instruments. But if you'd like to show them, that'd be fine. And nor do we like them. You can give it to the Sergeant. Thank you.
8990	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	ZZs409-zmok	1550	1563	Any witnesses in opposition? I see none. Questions and comments from committee? All right. We have a motion for Mr. Gordon and a second for Mr. Chiu. Like to close?
8991	Eggman	Susan Talamantes	73	DEi_8R7XWOE	988	999	The need for groundwater recharge was recognized by the administration last year during these plans and we have been working with stakeholders. And, we'll continue to work with stakeholders on any concerns that may come up.
8992	Hill	Jerry	66	g6zVy-O_oEg	4	33	Thank you Chair, and Mr. Givens it's nice to see you again. Thank you for being here today. I think it was in December when, I live in the Bay Area, and listening to the media I heard a Five hundred-dollar five million dollar grant was coming for earthquake early warning, and basically what I was hearing was we've solved the problem we've got the funding it on the way, it's done.
8993	McCarty	Kevin	22	qE4PUm4PrFo	715	782	It's hard for that when they're trying to regroup from the hits in the last five years, the recession though. Okay. Any comments from the Committee members? So this item will also be held open until the May revision and I think we're going to do these two together and then a public comment on that CTE pieces for the pathways initiative and the issue number three. Issue four. CTE pathways initiative.
8994	Lackey	Tom	10	2vYcwmo23_E	119	149	I just have a comment. And I hope everybody understands that there is a mutual benefit both to the officer and to the public-at-large. We are the partners that are naturally supposed to be aligned together but, there are some very serious concerns and I think that before we implement, that we need to carefully consider the impacts of each one of these considerations because the public deserves it, the officers deserve it, and we have a responsibility to carefully examine these facts before we move forward.
8995	Dodd	Bill	71	6dKd_uGq3Mo	1064	1082	But you know, if there was one, if a franchisee knew that he was being terminated, and there was another franchisee that wanted something that he had, and he sold that asset to them before this evaluation was done, they could come in and say, I'm sorry.
8996	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	j_gGP70jLkM	1075	1094	Part of this is we don't educate ourselves to the fact that the same symptoms that men experience and we know is potentially a heart attack, we also experience and yet do nothing about it. There are some symptoms however that are different and we need to educate ourselves on what those are
8997	Frazier	Jim	114	WL8066nF9bw	1209	1218	And so, I appreciate you bringing it to the forefront so we can identify that this is actually a need. So again, as I say, I'm going to support your bill. Madame Secretary, would you call the roll?
8998	Wieckowski	Bob	55	QmHhObaXRjg	751	773	So I'd like to add some clarity to the bill that that's where I would start. Now, obviously, the local agencies could, that's guidance. They could trump it, and come up with their own understanding. I also recognize that local agencies do not wanna share the tax with the state of California.
8999	Anderson	Joel	57	zO-5FwV_Tmk	1037	1054	those programs that were supported on the Senate Floor, on the backs of these poor people, is wrong. They should be in the budget. They deserve to be in the budget. They're core services, they should be treated as core services, not set up on some flimsy tax, that may come or go.
9000	Bonta	Rob	85	jcqm9XlDQYM	796	807	This modest investment in healthcare will be transformational in the lives of families and kids and we'll save dollars we are currently spending to provide limited care in overcrowded emergency rooms.
9001	Leyva	Connie	62	h0Gkdxuepz8	1233	1246	Good morning. Thank you very much for that very comprehensive report. I have two questions. One, the 500 schools that are on the watch list, what places them on a watch list?
9002	De Leon	Kevin	102	Mt9BcU600uM	1277	1320	Thank you Senator. Okay colleagues we're gonna move forward with our agenda. It is not long, at all, whatsoever. We have file item number three, we have the governor appointees are not subject to actual confirmation, but are not required to appear, but I should say subject to confirmation. Do we have one? Are we okay Mr. Cannella? Well okay, so we have file item number three, we have B-G. We have a motion made by Senator Holly Mitchell. Madame Secretary please call the roll.
9003	Maienschein	Brian	84	ASNmI2rHU9I	1964	1983	So, I in, in order also just to be consistent, I did oppose SB-746, last year, involve, involving the plans and some disclosure processes that were proprietary in nature and I do want to be consistent with my earlier vote.
9004	Pavley	Fran	104	45ZR2HT6sPs	503	519	Even though the technologies had changed, they didn't adopt to any changes of review. The second man-made forum requires that DOGGR review all its regulations and other rules every 10 years. As I said, things do change and they need to be up to date.
9005	Allen	Travis	43	8bOmzPkZfE0	1306	1325	This bill this year AB 839 was adjusted to address the governor's veto concerns. AB 839 provides representation for parents and charter school opportunities in California on the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence to ensure that every student has access to the best education available.
9006	Hill	Jerry	66	HrV-lrSKHCA	942	958	OK, very good. And, yes, there, perfect. And I apologize for... I was assuming you would be coming up during the public, but I didn't know you were specifically set on the agenda, so it's my fault.
9007	Pan	Richard	96	89bDX7qtwgo	31	44	So, just to cut, I know what you're saying, to cut that short, do you think they're overpaying, or do you think they're appropriate rates? I think they are paying what- It's as if they have to meet this actually sound principle, and I assume that we're negotiate with the plans.
9008	Bonta	Rob	85	gmSplS1IxCE	33	48	AB 266 emerges language from the two large regulatory framework bills that enter the Assembly Appropriations Committee and crafts a hybrid approach to reach an innovative middle ground on this important issue for the future of California.
9009	Nazarian	Adrin	36	tZPhmJE-0lQ	370	384	Thank you Mr Treasurer, I'm supportive. As we had discussed this previously, what I was looking for was a little more information which we started getting some more. I appreciate that. I look forward to lengthier dialogue.
9010	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	7UjH6y-2-HM	38	54	We have four bills on consent, and those bills on consent are AB 496, Mr. Rendon, AB 943, Mr. Allen, AB 1064, Mr. Hernandez, and AB 1206, with amendments recommended in the committee analysis.
9011	Mullin	Kevin	31	6nzz0SRNk10	931	943	All members vote who desire to vote, all members vote who desire to vote, all members vote who desire to vote. The clerk will close the roll and tally the vote. Ayes 68, noes 0, measure passes.
9012	Wood	Jim	72	81AHHgExKGE	2030	2047	The one thing that's brought up in the discussion that I'd like to point out is that we have heard that the independent medical review that the plans are willing to institute that on their own which I think would take care of part of the reason for the bill.
9013	Bonta	Rob	85	h3qpDny4S5o	1597	1621	Okay. Thank you. Also, the July rate review I want to drill down a little bit more and see how that interplays with our budget process. We have a budget. We're going to pass it on June fifteenth. Afterwards we're going to have a rate review. One of the first ones that we've had in a while from DHCS.
9014	Stone	Mark	20	1l8Sm-QNSvU	980	994	I'm very happy to work with you Mr. Chair, with your committee and others to make sure that we put in place that framework so that we have a known quantity moving forward and a stable earned income tax credit. That's what AB 43 is about.
9015	Wieckowski	Bob	55	QRS30WyiTXk	362	376	Certainly, I'm open for that, anything I can do to help the department, the State Department of Equalization better determine the fiscal impact of the legislation. I would be eager to work hand in hand with them on that.
9016	McGuire	Mike	93	4-5ngRp_LtI	1082	1101	And we have to remember that these vendors would also be subject to the oversight of the local farmer's market management and their board, along with ABC. So I think there are significant rules and regulations, and checks and balances in place to ensure responsible drinking.
9017	Pan	Richard	96	37JGlYuk31E	876	900	Except you had people being afraid to go to businesses, going transit, going to schools when an outbreak happens, even the outbreak that only affected, actually, 135 people were infected. It affected thousands, if not more than that, people in the state of California. And we don't need to have another one, and another one.
9018	Allen	Benjamin	70	JwS_raJ5ApY	643	668	In the Workman case in the 4th Circuit just came down in 2011. Most recently the 2nd district, 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in the Phillips case just this year, 2015, once again founded that the mandatory vaccinations as a condition of admission, for admission to school constitutionally, is a constitutionally permissible police power of the state that does not infringe upon the free exercise of religion.
9019	Runner	Sharon	4656	7i9bh_kaYv0	611	619	I guess have a question, because most parents put their kids in kindergarten because they're ready to have a little break there for either that half or full day.
9020	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	JG7mRMz5Gp8	1310	1334	Thank you, thank you Mr. Alejo. And let me just, just ask you a question quickly. You know I appreciate the intent of your bill which is to funnel dollars to the classroom and get bad actors out of leadership positions without giving them a significant amount of money to go away. So, what I'm gonna ask you to do, will you work with ACSA further, as this moves forward? And I'll support your bill today, I don't know if I'll support it in the future.
9021	Monning	Bill	25	GNC2APr9uoc	2199	2268	So I think it would be helpful for us in terms of homework assignment to get a sense in each of these categories what are the short and long-term objectives with some forecast of can those achieved within the budget year, within two years, and in the interim of achieving those objectives that I think by definition should result in lifting a moratorium to a permanent status program, what can we do to accelerate the review of exemption requests when for families a six-month or one-year delay - you've missed the boat and potentially with life-and-death consequences. It seems there needs to be a triage system within the exemption request review where certain cases get moved to the top, but I don't know if it's fair for any patient to say you're not at the top of the list, but there may be with medical input a way to do some prioritization for use of those limited resources.
9022	Huff	Bob	105	AI_qbYqntVY	850	874	Thus, denying citizens their legal due process. Jay Beeber with Safer Streets LA is available to answer any questions you may have. I would like to point out to you first, if you have these things in front of you, there's a map that just shows locations of these scattered throughout this park district and a couple of illustrations follow.
9023	Mitchell	Holly	64	XFSLCFM97Og	1753	1773	But tell me, from your perspective, in your five-month period of time, what your top two goals to wrap your arms around, and begin to effect some change on the administrative personnel and budget side of the house, which is the work that you've been bought there to do?
9024	Daly	Tom	118	xhI7BgS1JK0	372	390	Thank you very much. Any other speakers in support of this bill? Are there folks here who want to speak against this bill? Alright. There are, there's no one speaking against it. Are there questions by committee members? Questions or comments? If not, Mr. Holden, you can wrap up please.
9025	Beall	Jim	92	xvcU4IJP8VQ	698	728	There are some people that say well why don't we change the rules, and say it requires less than a two-thirds vote. Which I'm sure my friend here next to me would oppose no doubt. But the other approach might be to establish on an annual basis a fund that incentivizes these counties to sorta tell their voters.
9026	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	yhx1NvxzAgA	787	801	people escaped, particularly down to South America where they lived out their natural lives. That being said, and I say that because I completely understand and share that concern that we want justice.
9027	Nielsen	Jim	68	U931SFow8w0	1641	1667	Well, I'll note that I am sympathetic with Caltrans' plight, but it certainly harkens to the plight of everybody else who has got to comply with these CARB regulations and their costs. Is it your understanding that as CARB changes its regs -- give you an example, the diesel retrofit, okay?
9028	Mitchell	Holly	64	tf_1MHXwKaY	1486	1509	when I consider the fact that we spend so much time in this Committee, in this body, talking about access to care. And frankly, the vast majority of our policy access and budget access have focused on access as opposed to the provider network that has to be there to really, indeed, provide access. So, sometimes, we speak with forked tongue.
9029	Wieckowski	Bob	55	aB7RvRc_cTU	605	622	And the impact that that's going to have on water quality, but it's also having it on their waste treatment plants. There are 28 of their 29 waste treatment plants are designed, they're gravity run, so they're all next to the bay at elevation zero.
9030	Pavley	Fran	104	aMmnutMx8lk	3	23	Resources and Water Committee and we are going to start as a subcommittee of this committee. It's gonna be a very busy day throughout the Capitol. So members will be coming and going presenting bills in one house and whatever. But this is the last week and very important items on today's agenda.
9031	Harper	Matthew	14	cBCfsH22JkY	1296	1322	If I can, respectfully. The issue here is that what this does is it shuts down petroleum extraction activity every time there's a 2.5 earthquake. And you have areas which have had earthquake activity perpetually, you know, for as long as there has been human records. And so the question is how often should we be shutting down petroleum extraction activity? And this looks very excessive.
9032	Chavez	Rocky	83	NULZ8SoEhtM	87	110	In order to effectively offer our students an appropriate education foundation, we must provide accurate, continuous opportunities for our teachers to enhance the professional development. The best way in doing so is to offer ongoing coaching mentors to assist teachers implementation. I have here Ed Voice. Go ahead.
9033	Leno	Mark	60	6d5kBV-0MQs	292	313	Senator Anderson pointed out in particular that we could certainly attend to that growing mountain if we notified folks that they were prohibited and that they should not be in possession. So that's $250,000 in this proposal. There's no new money in this.
9034	Mitchell	Holly	64	tf_1MHXwKaY	1452	1464	Thank you. I'll be brief Mr. Chair. Thank you, sir. I just have to say in observation that it's clear that late hour amendments often make interesting bedfellows, particularly this time of the year.
9035	Nazarian	Adrin	36	lVI-Q1bHrK4	101	131	Good afternoon, Mr. Chair and Senators. Approximately 16% of Californians who are HIV-positive do not know they are HIV-positive and are not receiving treatment and unintentionally exposing others. This percentage rises to 58% for people up to the age of 24. The 20,000 Californians who do not know they are HIV positive are causing 70% of new infections in our state.
9036	Frazier	Jim	114	9A2k7SwFZ7M	1274	1288	Before we go any further, any other committee members have any questions for Jennifer or Kiana? You guys do a really good job. No questions. So we'll move on to Rob Lapsley. Did you have a question, Chair?
9037	Lara	Ricardo	107	-Ah0Dbgfor4	1693	1706	SB 315, healthcare access demonstration project grants. That's a do pass recommendation. We will substitute the roll from SB 454. That bill is approved on a 5-2 vote. With Republicans voting no.
9038	Hill	Jerry	66	icpOpHkAqBE	153	170	Thank you, other witnesses who are in support? Are there any witnesses in opposition, I see no one, very good. We do have a, yes, Senator Mendoza you had a question? But we will establish a quorum, not yet, so please madame secretary please call the roll
9039	Nielsen	Jim	68	0JAWKMIHR6Q	1031	1045	There were a lot of denials of citizens, of people, of special interests that should have known better and argued better as this was all being proposed that they were gonna be comfortable that those rights would be protected.
9040	McCarty	Kevin	22	FLwgnBwucWM	2372	2387	Okay, before we get to the LAO, there's a fourth thing, I believe. You took out the provision where. That locals could use the Career Pathways Trust as the match as well.
9041	Holden	Chris	78	nhED5L0HREU	1632	1658	Thank you, Madame Speaker and members. Senate Concurrent Resolution 1 is relative to the selection of Diane Boyer-Vine as the legislative counsel of California. Diane Boyer-Vine has served as the legislative counsel since June 2002. The legislative counsel oversees a staff of 560 employees who provide expert non-partisan legal and technical services to members of the Legislature. I ask for your aye vote.
9042	Chavez	Rocky	83	TbimRTTdSU4	152	167	Very few of them actually make that number. I used to track that, when I was over at the California Department of Veteran Affairs. They did the best, and they weren't, and we barely, we didn't make the number.
9043	Hueso	Ben	48	LVzFkfmZq9U	1249	1263	They have a data bank that has never been breached, that has numbers that are, you know, any kind of identification that they issue, could be a passport that is authorized by the federal government.
9044	Lara	Ricardo	107	p1klb1Rl5Zc	1375	1401	No file. Comments or questions from Committee? Seeing none. It's AB 1519 by the Assembly Committee on Judiciary. Okay. We good? Perfect. Without objection, we'll move this item to the suspense file.
9045	Levine	Marc	8	ZQqDgc40U1M	1587	1601	Thank you very much Mr. Thurmond. A lot of the amendments actually embody, I feel, you know, one, a very good compromise and that's kind of the name of what we do, to figure out how to advance ideas. But also a lot of the concerns that you shared.
9046	Garcia	Cristina	112	ZW0bBeI7WzQ	42	58	And I know that the Pro Tem's engaging in this discussion, he's engaged with me, of how do we start to look at maybe DG and limiting it to my backyard, to incentivize that maybe our Charge Point isn't coming in because of economies of scale, so maybe that's where the utilities come in along the way.
9047	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	vHDzhT6IdSE	2063	2075	It has six votes. That bill is out. I think that's all of our bills. Senator Hertzberg is out today, so we are now adjourned. Thank you Senator Leno.
9048	Beall	Jim	92	12bt77nSPXs	309	332	And I'm concerned that's gonna be a pattern that's gonna continue every fiscal year. We're gonna just keep adding programs and things like that. But I think that we have to maybe take a step back and start looking at community based options, like various community based alternatives.
9049	Baker	Catharine	74	BbpWOgfWUd0	744	755	I think we have all of us, we just want to say thank you very much and you can call-in anyone of us any time for how we can continue to be helpful we are very grateful.
9050	Bonta	Rob	85	mAghe_hYP-0	30	40	I want to encourage folks to keep their comments to less than a minute, if possible, so that everyone has a chance to make their statement and make their comments. Thank you.
9051	Maienschein	Brian	84	QmHhObaXRjg	471	491	Okay. Do you have further questions or comments? No? Okay. Do we have a motion? We have a motion from Ms. Gonzalez, second from Mr. Cooley. I'd ask the clerk to please call the roll.
9052	Gallagher	James	108	DgVvXUz7n-U	247	261	This bill is not properly before this extraordinary session, as it is not consistent with the purpose stated for the extraordinary session, which is health care funding. This bill has nothing to do with funding health care and MediCal.
9053	Mathis	Devon	75	-R4HGT4UbOs	2142	2177	In 1998, the Senaida Garcia child development and training center opened in Visalia in her name. And, by the time of her retirement in 2004, she oversaw the operation of 43 centers serving over 6000 children and parents. Senaida was the first Hispanic and first woman to serve on the Visalia Unified school district board of trustees.
9054	Block	Marty	59	f0azg54_KEY	1436	1447	Okay, allow me to express a concern and then I'll stop. You know, I had a bill last year that dealt with the monitoring of nursing homes and enforcement of nursing home rules.
9055	Pavley	Fran	104	zYzr-HEEMIA	947	980	Opposition to the bill. Opposition to this bill. You can stand up and we can see that. And for our records, I'd say, what, 30 or 40, easily, people, that have come all this way. Probably more than that. Thank you very much for coming. I see this is an important issue to all of you. Now, open it up for questions of the witnesses.
9056	Salas	Rudy	34	CoCqxpnnd8w	1706	1729	Thank you, Madam Chair. I just respectfully ask for an aye vote. This is a good, common sense project that will actually help the infrastructure for the entire state, helps move water. I do appreciate letting us move this bill forward. We will work in the interim to secure the funding for this. And that's our discussions with leadership in both houses and with the governor's office as well.
9057	Mullin	Kevin	31	23L8yaBtAnI	897	911	Members, please take your conversations off the floor. And, a reminder for folks in the back of the chambers to keep your conversations to a minimum. We have business before us. We're trying to wrap up this afternoon. Mr Allen you may continue.
9058	Stone	Mark	20	zjaMes6iB6Q	481	493	There's support recommendations on both sides, so I don't think you need to convince us to support the bill, not necessarily everyone's going to vote for it but it's got a pretty good chance. So, just spend a couple of minutes and tell us your story.
9059	Gomez	Jimmy	80	E5Lv9C_D3vg	225	298	Hold in Committee. Yeah. Yup. SB 42 Liu. Now we're on the education packet. SB 42 Liu, Establish Office of Higher Education Performance and Accountability. Sorry about that. Ready?
9060	Mitchell	Holly	64	dmdc2oNqHGQ	35	56	That's certainly our commitment, but we want to prepare you for a very robust and long hearing. There'll be three parts for today's hearing. Part A will cover Developmental Services, Part B will cover the remainder of Human Services  and Part C includes Health Related issues.
9061	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	jSYoUQmoG0c	2318	2335	I just need to work with David Chiu, our Assemblymember, who evidently has had some success at getting that through, get some of his recommendations. Speak to the thing that assembly member Steinorth is talking about, and just work with both parties to, to make this happen.
9062	Block	Marty	59	A1UTGLmNv2E	2094	2112	The sailors trained in San Diego, Los Angeles, and San Francisco and return to call these places home after years of fierce combat in the Pacific and the Atlantic. The 20 first-century Navy Reserve Sailors  step up in ways that would have been unthinkable a century ago.
9063	Calderon	Ian Charles	115	BISvC49mosc	1464	1486	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Gonzalez, I was wondering if you can help me with something. I've received two calls about this bill from the business community in opposition, however they are not in opposition to your bill in its original form. They are actually in opposition to the bill that contained the Chamber of Commerce amendments,
9064	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	MPEe2Ccro74	56	71	It does this in a way that has a very minor impact on the worker contribution rate and is fiscally sustainable for years to come. With that, I would ask for your aye vote.
9065	Beall	Jim	92	__RebzhDkwE	72	87	This fee is supposed to recover cost, and certainly it does not do so at $200. We're a big state. It costs a lot of money to do these things, and I urge an aye vote on this.
9066	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	MPEe2Ccro74	20	36	Thank you, Madame President and members. AB 908 will provide economic security for all workers. I would like to note that the author work with the opposition, reached a compromise, and all opposition to the build before you here today has been removed.
9067	Gatto	Mike	46	mXX7qM53na4	855	870	Yes, we could do a lot of good if we do that, but we don't, because that's not what we do in this country. We do not take people's samples, store them indefinitely, and then do experimentation on them without consent. That's all that this bill does.
9068	Stone	Mark	20	DgVvXUz7n-U	1290	1306	Which is typically how we've done it in our culture. We are so afraid of death and talking about death. That we are not willing to face it with a loved one who is going through the dying process and making that decision. And in that case, I will submit to you that we are reacting to their death for
9069	Beall	Jim	92	__RebzhDkwE	50	72	If the $200 fee set in 1943, that's the record of not changing, if that included a CPI adjustment the fee would be over $2000, and this bill does that. So furthermore, the increase will lower cost pressure on the general fund account.
9070	Lara	Ricardo	107	YfyxpSh_BfE	199	222	But above that, I think we need to continue to have this discussion about the master plan for higher education. And understanding that we're not meeting our goals. And also the fact that our state institutions are not admitting our California residents at the levels that they should, despite us giving them more money.
9071	Gipson	Mike	28	ch_qINsbUNA	1341	1357	And we're simply saying that, certainly for preparation purposes, that the State Board of Equalization, under 567, will only allow the basic information, that is that something has occurred and and that's it. No further information should be given from that particular point.
9072	Leno	Mark	60	SQEMna8rhH0	158	177	Thank you Madam Speaker. This is a bill that's not only appropriate, but needed and necessary, especially with the changes that have been made most recently by the passage of Prop 47, and I know you have a very significant and impressive coalition of supporters, so we're happy to welcome them this morning. Who's gonna go first?
9073	Harper	Matthew	14	a4X1msw4NL8	1529	1542	Thank you Mr speaker. I rise in favor of this improved bill. I believe that it helps level the playing field for those who work in solid waste as well as promoting recycling within the State of California and urge a yes vote.
9074	Lara	Ricardo	107	YfyxpSh_BfE	181	199	Thank you. I want to support one of my fellow colleagues, Senator Block. I mean nonetheless I think we have to address the urgent need to increase the number of four-year degrees by 2025. This is attaining an additional 60,000 Bachelor's degrees per year.
9075	Pavley	Fran	104	YrZrpwtmLSQ	1862	1878	In exchange you teach in an underserved community as defined by a variety of factors, and those teachers you could really attract some really high quality people into the classroom.
9076	Roth	Richard	106	zKRXexcG8LM	996	1012	it does not restrict claims for personal injuries. We need to dramatically reform ADA compliance in this state with education, training, and a fair opportunity to correct, this bill is a step in the right direction.
9077	Rodriguez	Freddie	69	89bDX7qtwgo	968	983	Because a lot of these folks may not have that accessibility, or know where to go, or they're being told by a provider. Oh you know what, you can't come in till tomorrow or the following week. So guess what they do, they call 911. And we are going to come and take them to the hospital.
9078	Quirk	Bill	23	sl1U-4U9lwY	722	752	All right, so we now have Mr. Erik White who is the Chief of the Mobile Sources Control Division at the California Air Resources Board. He oversees a staff of 160 in the development and implementation of key California light duty and heavy duty emissions reduction programs for both new and used conventional vehicles.
9079	Bonilla	Susan	3	HBOX_ihiZFg	338	353	There really, literally was no money. And I don't believe we're in the same period of time. And I believe that as we have seen, the state economy stabilize as we've focused on debt reduction.
9080	Gipson	Mike	28	m4SYy4oYAnU	1076	1099	Now they can benefit by staying home and this tax credit is actually working. I'm glad to see that. One of the things that I am concerned with and you can maybe share, shed some light, Nissan corporation, it wasn't under this administration but Nissan left and went to Tennessee because of the regulations here in California.
9081	Chang	Ling Ling	18	kLTY4thtXsA	1107	1117	While the costs associated with this bill are just high enough to have it flagged as a candidate for suspense, the potential reward for enacting this review of burdensome regulations is priceless.
9082	De Leon	Kevin	102	smXlkYaEapc	0	17	Thank you. Any other witnesses in support? Any other witnesses in support of either Ms. Randolph or Mr. Picker? I'm seeing none. Those in opposition? Seeing any opposition. Any folks in opposition? Seeing no opposition, those who are either a; neutral, or who have concerns.
9083	Chau	Ed	116	ullCtaxzBRw	406	424	I'm glad you touch a little bit, first-time I heard a word housing is when you answer somebody member Brough's question. So is the government Governors going to do something and, the energy area and the housing area is my question.
9084	Pan	Richard	96	Ew5hLn0iC0U	491	507	But, I also wanna be sure that you're gonna have clinics that the tribes are licensing, essentially that are outside and there may be some confusion as to who's responsible.
9085	Beall	Jim	92	8m8Es5iF3dE	1563	1587	So we have like this conflict between the business model on the internet and the property, and we're trying to somehow resolve that. Generally in terms of property, I don't think that other types of uses of property, internet platforms get involved or, are involved in that kind of enforcement mechanism.

According to the 2010 US census, the Asian-Indian population in the United States grew by nearly 70% in the last 10 years, making it one of the fastest-growing ethnic groups in the United States. Today, there are over half a million Americans of Indian

The same Senator from Bell Gardens said, "What we see and what we will continue to see is that the people are making themselves rich out of these technologies don't look like you and I and don't come from the economic experience and backgrounds that we share."

Permanently protecting this region will ensure the animal and plant life continue to flourish and that future generations will benefit from this area's natural beauty.
9090	Wolk	Lois	94	jAn9ObwSR14	1299	1324	Before we close out the hearing, we need to have public comment. If there's anyone who wishes to make public comment, please come forward. While that is happening, I wanted to say on behalf of Senator Pavley, who is a member of the Budget Subcommittee who has a long interest in the department and is not able to be with us today, gave me a couple questions that I'd just like to -one of which you've answered in your materials, but the other one not.
9091	Bigelow	Frank	91	FVQ4YG_BqFE	1429	1443	Are those the areas that we are currently using for production purposes, and are those the areas that would most likely need this product in the tool box, if there is a spill the most?
9092	Pavley	Fran	104	5L0obLeeOIE	375	420	He said he wants information to be accessible to the public, and directed us to work with DWR. So we have, and that's the bill before us today. This bill would make well logs available to the public, requires persons requesting a report to do so on a form identifying the name and address of the requester, so this is not posting everything on the Internet, so everyone can see, you actually have to come in to DWR fill out a form, name, address, why you need the information so if there is security concerns later on, there's some paranoia that someone is going to go and steal your pipes, your plumbing, your copper, or whatever, you have the information of the thief on file.
9093	Pan	Richard	96	EK6oKbTFoPo	1028	1045	When they show up in the Medi-Cal program, talking Medi-Cal rates and whatever else. I mean it's the general taxpayer who's paying for that. So I realize that in this report, it's primarily looking at it as. But I hope that we, when we tab the discussions, and maybe we should think about that, how these two tie together.
9094	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	0JpwnSkUZnE	1730	1745	And so, as we start looking at contracting with the state for example, getting those numbers up because a lot of businesses, that's how they get their startup. Either through government and then hopefully they can expand and then start from, and become a prime one day.
9095	Dababneh	Matthew	50	TmtzANXYgv0	130	144	I mean, it seems like you describe a bad situation that happened to our customer under current law, but I don't see how that really plays in your opposition of the bill today. How this current law made this situation worst and how does this undermine current law?
9096	Pan	Richard	96	EK6oKbTFoPo	1009	1028	And I hope when we look at some of these things, we need to put both of those together, because in the end, as a taxpayer, I'm the one, taxpayers are the ones who are bearing the costs if the activity, the people who are encouraging the activity, they're not paying for those costs.
9097	McCarty	Kevin	22	5c1qN9DEfbU	700	712	Sometimes we say, oh they're the UCLA football coach or in the teaching hospitals, versus faculty administration. So if you can do it in those silos, in addition to the fund?
9098	Mitchell	Holly	64	L-zMn7PZXCE	1236	1266	Thank you. Are there representatives in the public from other counties? No. So we heard that the state has performance expectations that would require a staffing level much higher than what's being proposed. Are other counties suffering from the same, I guess, period of reduced funding? Are they also struggling with their ability to get the work done
9099	Bonta	Rob	85	JfU4ybXUoBc	2158	2172	Thank you. Okay, oh, next, we're gonna go to the consent calendar. We can entertain a motion. We have a motion. We have a second. Dr. Wood, thank you. Madam Secretary, please call the roll.
9100	De Leon	Kevin	102	aItBzVMycEU	1542	1561	That is on page five of lines 30 and 34 just wanna, you know, just for informational purposes, I think that we have drafted this bill in such a manner that is comprehensive, but parts of it are still ongoing without doubt. More happy to engage with our colleagues.
9101	McGuire	Mike	93	u0-ac-4sGAg	2254	2273	I'm gonna just be very brief here, that this bill does not touch any of the current revenue that's coming in from any of the 27 rigs that are off of the state of California right now, and in fact the state of California brought in 400, nearly $426 million from off-shore oil, excluding our federal payments.
9102	Weber	Shirley	44	dv1TuQD9iKk	1037	1053	We've got some bills already out that'll be coming forward. I'm hoping members will carefully look at it, that we won't get caught up in the individual jurisdiction story that every police department needs to make its own decision about how it's going to police people and all those kinds of things.
9103	Mitchell	Holly	64	VaSvldadoEI	1114	1128	Thank you. Finance, would you do me a favor and adjust the mic right there on the podium? Would you just push it down? Thank you very much. Thank you. Hello, my friend.

AB302 would also require schools to allow lactating students to bring a breast pump to schools and store express milk. And it would require schools to provide these students with a reasonable break time or time away from the classroom to accommodate their lactation schedule.
9106	Bigelow	Frank	91	nsi_dMaCc9g	708	729	And in particular working with my office and my staff  to make sure we address the plethora of needs through your bill. Also being one of those representatives who does have prisons within his district, recognizing that component is also very valuable. So I just wanna give you a lot of praise for your efforts on this particular bill. And thank you very much.
9107	Obernolte	Jay	86	b-HFYxTUJfo	1146	1154	I'd like to take you up on your offer to talk a little about more about the homeowners exemption for power tools because I'd very much like to support the bill, and that's a chief concern that I have.
9108	Weber	Shirley	44	E2qxwCiVZM4	1109	1130	The bill makes it clear. In California, the evaluation of certificate employees does not rely on a single test score. In establishing examples of pupil progress, AB 1495 helps to clarify that under laws, school districts have multiple measures from which to gauge evidence of student progress as the mandatory student learning component.
9109	Hueso	Ben	48	LFikd5rYakY	2042	2063	Madame President. I just want to hear some clarification on this bill. The presentation described that we're voting on about $200 million and the bill text and the language in our file says that it this is a $2.3 billion bill, so I just want a clarification on that.
9110	Stone	Mark	20	jIa2_lUgVm8	47	71	And one of my concerns is that by putting in a contract that you're either now considered a minister, or putting language to make someone a minister, even when they don't realize that they're performing that function, or don't have any intention of performing that function, because they're maybe not of that religion or they're seeing themselves as lay.
9111	Frazier	Jim	114	zZ5dG3yEymQ	16	34	Any other questions? Seeing none, thanks Steven for your presentation.  I'm gonna call to the dais now Mr. Will Kempton.

Mr. Kempton thank you for coming.
9112	Jones	Brian	42	YRy2ye6IBrE	2140	2149	I just need to ask a clarifying question real quick. I'm sorry, you said that the bill would not create a new bureaucracy, but our analysis indicates that it could.
9113	Mitchell	Holly	64	Mt9BcU600uM	1472	1492	I have to say the department never brought forward an action that was acceptable. I just wanted to say that in the record and say that either through this committee's work, budget, something - I hope that we have a different experience, particularly different, incoming directly from the department.
9114	Pavley	Fran	104	_H7zvwgU_3w	1185	1204	That is updated every few years. I think this Committee and others should be really engaged in looking at that plan and matching where are the emissions, where are they coming from? Then it's based on all the hearings.
9115	Allen	Benjamin	70	zaVlsvC4ABg	139	148	I asked the folks in Denver, "If you vote every election how many elections will you typically vote in a ten year in a four year cycle?" And they said something around ten.
9116	Berryhill	Tom	54	hQoyRwEukvY	747	760	As you just mentioned, historically we just haven't done that, so if we can change that paradigm a little bit maybe this is a little bit easier to swallow at the end of the day.

It's illegal to sell in California e-cigarette products to those under 18, but these companies market legally, because they're unregulated by federal law, they market to our youth in flavors like Gummy Bears, and Tutti Frutti, and Mountain Dew, and root beer.
9118	Nguyen	Janet	65	oFD3dFY_sMo	1243	1282	I have a question. I'm sorry, the gentlemen. You mentioned you administered a CalWORKS program. And the two goal that the legislature have always ask is, one is reduce poverty. The other one is welfare to work. Have we been able to accomplish that? Set aside this issue, I understand today's hearing. But since I have you here as the expert, I wanna hear what the expert have to say in terms, have we been able to reduce poverty? Have we been able to move people from welfare to work?
9119	Block	Marty	59	DcIk90J9Qng	212	229	Sure we'll hear the comments, questions before, after. Let's let's move to a vote first then, Mike, if you would. Any other member of the public wish to address the committee on this item? Okay, please Staff please read the motion and call the roll.
9120	Mitchell	Holly	64	w14C8IiFUpY	56	77	I guess that takes me back to the LAO's first point about currently available administrative data do not allow for conclusive findings in the outcomes of recent changes. I don't know if I'm measuring and looking at the right trend to determine success or not. You know, I assume it is sanctions; maybe it isn't.
9121	Lara	Ricardo	107	qbKF38sndDw	842	867	AB 210, LA County HOV lanes, hours of operation, do pass to the Senate Floor. Substitute the roll of AB 361, that bill is approved on an unanimous vote of 7-0. Moving on to AB 1164, water conservation, drought tolerant landscaping. Do pass as amended to delete DWR incentive program and 300 million appropriation. Secretary, please call the roll.
9122	Pan	Richard	96	DKVG7yVdxSc	65	99	So, we may look at it from how much it, you know, what we have to do on the state budget. Just recognize that impacts the overall economy. We're talking about jobs. I mean this money doesn't just, it goes to pay for nurses and clinics and buildings and rent and clerical staff and so forth. Those are jobs that people perform to actually provide services to people who actually need those services. It's not make work, hopefully no one will imagine that.
9123	Gaines	Beth	109	n57XOOZPs8w	1525	1534	I have no idea. I just am concerned about the penalty per se if someone not knowing that they have to pay it by three o'clock or it's considered late.
9124	De Leon	Kevin	102	bB6-EJZQbO8	184	211	Each of these individuals bring a unique perspective to Commission, which is critical to ensure thatwe have high-quality of teacher preparation programs in our state. Again, this matter was resolved the Rules Committee in a bipartisan manner. Mr. President, as well as colleagues, I respectfully ask for an aye vote.
9125	Wood	Jim	72	mgHzB-qdttI	1374	1386	I'd love to see we, that we get MDs. And, I would love to see that we figure out a way to get MDs there as well. So, I can, I can see quite honestly, I can see the efficiency through supervision.
9126	Hill	Jerry	66	ChbIO5XT7O8	1392	1407	If the bill that we voted on previously and earlier today. Senator  Leno's, which I voted for, if that bill is signed by the Governor, this bill will be included in that effort because the state act would be included in that definition change.
9127	Weber	Shirley	44	NRrL3g0f7-g	866	883	because it's no longer a situation where we have children going to kindergarten just to socialize, just to learn how to sit in a line, sit on a seat and walk in a line, which I went to kindergarten. It now has a curriculum, and parents need to be aware of that, that this is a mandatory curriculum that
9128	Weber	Shirley	44	_b18tzFsHIo	1619	1632	Several reports and studies has established the fact that foster youth face unique educational challenges. A recent report looked at year one LCFF implementation of foster youth and found the different definitions of foster youth in our foster youth services and LCFF statutes.
9129	Wolk	Lois	94	tJoPe6FpmUg	1383	1415	The best and adequate crews, the best emergency response requirements, and the basic principle here is as my witnesses explained, it's one of redundancy. That's what safety is about not one person in the cockpit, but two at all times. And at the moment we have that situation in California, we are preempted from continuing that. We don't want that to change, so it needs to become a statute.
9130	Leno	Mark	60	GObd4JWklwI	2176	2194	Assemblywoman thank you, your comments are very welcomed because in a perfect world we would be restoring it entirely. This is really compromising the truest sense in that we split down the middle everything that the senate wanted to do, as well as what the assembly wanted to do.
9131	Pan	Richard	96	2Yu9E6dAMwM	514	522	So essentially, I mean, there are benchmark standards that we need to just establish which ones we're using in California. So, that's a much a more straight forward act.
9132	Eggman	Susan Talamantes	73	v8Lqd5JpuF0	814	831	If they pull out crops, if they pull things out, if they have rubbish that needs to go, they have no other, other options if we don't have these biomass facilities but to burn them. And we know that just decimates our air quality. This is a, I think, a good, sensible, good policy bill and I highly support its passage.
9133	Gordon	Richard	117	UonYQneKEjk	456	473	Lord, as elected representatives of the people, we humbly ask you to make us an instrument of your peace. Where there is hatred, help us so love. Where there is despair, hope.  Where there is darkness, light.
9134	Hernandez	Ed	103	IKy1yzt0SRs	1830	1837	I've had the honor of knowing her for many years. She has done an outstanding job as an incredible public servant. And I just wanted to thank you, Jennifer, and I would just like to turn it over to her.
9135	De Leon	Kevin	102	A4tFO9bb3f0	234	249	Okay. I take it that the couple that were agnostic. So you're neutral, on the couple folks too. Okay, so you'll come up for opposition then. Okay, thank you very much. Next, those in support of the nominee.
9136	Liu	Carol	63	Laqdju9yTYg	137	164	So I mean I do agree with you that if the longer you go with this study the more you can...more results we can get from it and, how to improve the system but, then the question is when is that cut off? When do we get the return that we need in order to make this make our make our systems better? Do you have any idea?
9137	Quirk	Bill	23	pY9wY6wExdc	1458	1475	Very good. Any other witnesses in support? Then we need witnesses in opposition? Seeing no witnesses in opposition. Mr. Lackey, it's up to you and me. Do you have any questions or comments?
9138	Jones	Brian	42	HJEL7SBoV-4	87	102	This bill is sponsored by the Conference of California Bar Associations and supported by the Trust and Estates section of the State Bar of California. I thank you for your aye vote. And Larry Doyle is here to testify on behalf of the bill, if there are any questions.
9139	Pan	Richard	96	boBaH4nV9W8	1142	1154	And SB-591 will provide much needed revenue to improve access to healthcare for low income Californian families and individuals, including treatment of cancer, heart disease, stroke, lung disease, and other diseases related to tobacco use.
9140	Perea	Henry	33	uaZYquORnnU	1479	1495	So what we're looking to do is to provide a mechanism by which non-profit groups and others in the district can be the bridge to help these small communities apply for funding through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.
9141	Kim	Young	82	ejG5Ru6MX_o	1092	1111	So when we hold the meetings, obviously, we will be at least compensating them on the per diem basis if we are meeting them in Sacramento, for example, we'll be flying the members of the committee. So there would be some expenses incurred. That's just the way the commissions work.
9142	Beall	Jim	92	gDPCmEU7pmg	1131	1156	...or lower for the areas we're talking about. So you can't go into like wealthy downtown areas or anything. It kind of doesn't work for like a downtown redevelopment project or some kind of the kind of things we did in the past with redevelopment. When I was chairman of the San Jose Redevelopment Agency.
9143	Beall	Jim	92	fMvnlUAhyII	703	720	I think that's very important. When I was when I was a county supervisor, when we operated or our jail facility in Santa Clara County, we always looked at length of stay.
9144	Cooley	Ken	45	1kBpFTHnX5o	806	819	But you know, I think this bill is attempting to grapple with an important problem. And I know as a draftsman myself, drafting legislation, I often find myself saying when I'm putting a bill together.
9145	Stone	Jeff	26	vUWGQO4sF_w	256	268	The Lanterman Act set out an ideal in which people would developmental disabilities would have the opportunity, to live as independently as possible and maximize their potential through a system of community based organizations.
9146	Allen	Benjamin	70	LPogPkqnefY	643	664	I just had a very quick question for Secretary Laird. During your comments, and I might ahve missed this elsewhere in the presentation, but you seem to allude to a list of projects under 1E. Is there a list available, a list of projects committed under 1E that we can see?
9147	Leno	Mark	60	GObd4JWklwI	1053	1077	We want to thank the LAO, you'd identified an error, so there's some significant general fund savings. We're gonna take it. Do we have a motion by Senator Laura to recognize the LAO's finding and adopt it $187.4 million as such?
9148	Nguyen	Janet	65	Q3p12T-SoaE	1600	1618	So, it's not only just a burden on low-income families, it's a burden on all families. Back then, when I was in Orange County, it's a lot easier for mommy to go pick up my son, and I'm a little 400 Miles away right now, so it's a little hard for me to do so.
9149	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	Xjq2sHgkTwU	1551	1569	And in fact, it was, it is my hope that if probation officers feel that they are sitting in a courtroom with someone and it's compromising to them. They should know that they have that right. And I believe that they, if they don't, they, that should be part of the training.
9150	Low	Evan	11	-yqp2bxPUCM	6	20	Thanks very much Mr. Chair. Thank you very much for allowing me to present Assembly Bill 883. This bill simply prohibits employers from publishing or posting a job advertisement that disqualifies an applicant who is currently or was at one point a public employee.
9151	Weber	Shirley	44	iVjsAvWHgB0	1861	1873	The good thing of course is that both of us have done some significant work here, and so it's just a matter of us combing through. So, when we hold it open it's not because we holding open because we're wavering. It's because we're holding open because we want to do the best we can do.
9152	Garcia	Cristina	112	hb1VvxrKGQE	123	138	Based on the size of the average toddler, what's available on the market, we estimate that less than 1% of the parents would have to buy a new seat before their child turns two. After a child outgrows their infant car seat the parents usually buy a convertible or all in one car seat.
9153	Wieckowski	Bob	55	9--O0uTSOW4	371	397	So there won't be any text changes. There's no text changes? Just so that the members know what they're voting on, is that you're going to clarify for us, but that's- we're not changing any words in the text, so...
9154	Hertzberg	Robert	99	6r30p-6PJFA	524	546	Next, the CPUC by its own actions specifically prohibited cost sharing in addition to the legislation. Now since the energy crisis, in addition to what I just articulated, the PUC has been deeply focused on creating mechanisms to avoid cost shifting. It has been probably the most predominant aspect of its regulatory activity over the last number of years.
9155	McGuire	Mike	93	e-eay8FdlZA	1453	1478	I appreciate that. Look, there are 56 different systems throughout the state. We can all agree, there are in whatever issue you may be talking about, there are some counties that are going to excel, some that are going to do a pretty good job, and some that are going to have some challenges.
9156	De Leon	Kevin	102	NPktHkkmjlQ	1443	1469	more specifically the $150,000 and dealing with surety bond businesses that are stating right now that it will be very difficult to supply them. Or to actually provide the bond after stop order. The issue of the personal liability at the lowest level and obviously the question of joint liability. These are three issues right now that we are still working out right now as we speak,
9157	Mitchell	Holly	64	NwesQVgY4qI	1415	1431	Thank you very much. I appreciate the rich debate that this bill has brought forward today. First of all, I feel the need to initially say that I don't believe the preliminary hearing process is equivalent to a three ring circus by any means.
9158	Wagner	Donald	88	-OpN4Uo7BxE	1000	1016	We are very much beyond where we were in the 60's thankfully, very rightfully and in part because of the voting rights act. The Shelby court didn't get rid of the voting rights act, the Shelby court didn't undermine the voting rights act.
9159	Garcia	Eduardo	38	h4u4YccC9Z8	1267	1281	And so I, as their representative, bring this proposition forward and just thank you for acknowledging the creativity that's coming directly from the people underground that are trying to make a difference.
9160	Block	Marty	59	0IRzh1yPHfU	1577	1599	Okay, thank you. Show that passing, 3-0. That's item number 16. Item number 17, Local Assistance, Tools for Tolerance, Professional Development and Leadership Training. We'll first hear from the Department of Finance.
9161	De Leon	Kevin	102	LhZTpLi6UbE	2072	2109	Ok, committee appointments have officially been made. Filed items from the free through fourteen congratulations to all the members into all the agenda items are there. We're going to continue the agenda. We are go to file item number fifteen, however we're going to go to executive session, so I'm going to ask the folks to be so kind enough to please exit.
9162	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	MVCeSI-m6QA	1404	1434	Nonetheless, this is a moment we should honor and recognize and the next time you watch the olympics and you see our women standing tall on the platforms, winning those gold medals and indeed in the past several decades at far greater numbers than our male counterparts, we can remember we supported a measure that recognized the importance of title nine and recognizes the importance of girls and women in sports. I ask for your aye vote.
9163	Leno	Mark	60	aXebDhCekK4	23	43	We hope that everyone will be able to drop by at some point. But we are moving, hopefully, these bills to the floor today. So we'll get started in respect out of everyone's busy schedule today. We have Ms. Keely Bosler from the Department of Finance and also Chuck Bonham who's the director of Department of Fish and Wildlife joining us today.

9165	Mendoza	Tony	52	5EeaivfMcyY	1467	1502	My pleasure Mr. Charles, just to answer the question. The questions are related to the scope of practice regulation. The scope of practice regulation is not, first of all the regulation was approved by the office of administrative law, which were views all regulations and approved them for their regularity and consistency with current law.
9166	McGuire	Mike	93	zieucXg-cLU	640	655	Mr. Sweeney, I just greatly appreciate your hard work, sir, and your dedication to this important issue. And it's really great to have you here and thank you so much for your testimony today. It's good to see you. Good evening and welcome. If you can just state your first and last name.
9167	Mendoza	Tony	52	jjB76hKrhNA	925	946	I sure do, thank you Madam President. I would like to take a moment to introduce a few of the letra officials that are here visiting on behalf of contract cities these next few days from my district.

9168	Lara	Ricardo	107	uM-vqP4Hv8s	1728	1742	And so these are critical components to the overall UC experience. Senator Hancock hit the nail on the head when she said that the greatest institution in our country cannot need the race to the bottom. So respectfully ask your aye vote.
9169	Melendez	Melissa	41	nugSHhjUz14	343	368	Thank you Madam Chairwoman. Thank you for being here everyone. I will say on the outset that I am thankful that we find ourselves in a better economic circumstance than we did five or so years ago. But as has been repeated many times in this room, the state is highly dependent on volatile personal income tax revenue. And we seem to be enjoying a period of economic and revenue growth.
9170	Mitchell	Holly	64	GnxGwd8ZNfU	444	469	Thank you very much, Senator. I appreciate the opportunity to join with the Senate Human Services Committee and all of our colleagues to have a very important conversations that I think should be at the top of our agenda as policy-makers in the state of California because to politicize poverty I think would be a huge mistake on our parts at this point in time and our state's history, given the health of our general fund.
9171	Pavley	Fran	104	0J9n2c3eCds	1053	1081	and medium priority basins. About 25% of the basins determined to be in a high-stress level so that's what this applies to whether it's two or ten or whatever the number is. But then also the chart here is of somewhat relevance to the discussion. So if you take the Redding area on the chart or the Sacramento valley Red Bluff area, see the
9172	Wagner	Donald	88	dAMeavSqnLk	1021	1039	The procedures are there. There's no reason for us to be making any kinds of changes, much less any sort of retroactive changes and that's what this bill does. The other thing it does and the reason everyone should have concern here is that in essence the provisions of SB 641 run contrary to a portion of a very carefully negotiated piece of legislation from just 2 years ago, one session ago.
9173	Gipson	Mike	28	PZ5qNcZ4hzo	817	840	Mr. Speaker and members, I rise to present AB-25, which seeks to create an appeal process for schools that are unable to meet current car grant eligibility criteria. Current law provides car grants eligibility post secondary schools, trade schools, colleges and universities, students based on financial need.
9174	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	DPeb4bLxnpo	1798	1835	We talk about areas where they have no water or they have to use bottled water tend to be poor areas cuz whatever water they have, the quality is so inadequate. I'm just wondering when it comes to senior water rights, and riparian rights what steps are you taking, and do you plan to take to gain better control over the notion that these folks have had, either legitimately because of their legal position, or just cuz they can to, to really take advantage of this this drought for enormous financial gain? To the detriment of others.
9175	Brown	Cheryl	13	FgksiwkXKF4	215	233	I have with me today the Mayor of Fontana, Acquanetta Warren, and the Police Chief, as well as Jason Gonsalves who is here to talk about how the lack of funding has affected the local governments.
9176	Chiu	David	7	fD1zTE45tHI	1486	1501	Okay, thank you. I'd love to learn a little bit more about your centralization efforts. I know this is a constant push and pull within bureaucracies but, I for one, definitely think that those efforts are important and if it's possible to get a little bit of an update on that we'd be happy to get that. Thank you very much.
9177	Williams	Das	12	n5MXFS_19l0	1161	1188	The sad fact is nearly 0% of rapes end in any kind of accountability for the perpetrator and how can we provide in our society a deterrence, when less, nearly 0% end in any kind of accountability? And the answer is that because one in five women will experience sexual assault during their college career.
9178	Melendez	Melissa	41	iQQbLXy8ddc	298	320	Okay. Thank you very much. Don't go away. I am going to have some questions for you. Any other witnesses in the opposition to this bill? Okay, so then we will bring it up here for today's discussion. Members, do you have any questions? No questions on that side? So, the bill has been moved and seconded. I do have a question for you, though.
9179	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	BISvC49mosc	1551	1565	And in fact, the way that this language came about was because the DIR, when they put out their original FAQs before the end of the year said, if you want a separate accrual method, you have to give those three days up front, and people went a little crazy.
9180	McGuire	Mike	93	MOa6yahtOBc	727	748	We're gonna be asking how counties and providers can work together more effectively to ensure that kids on psychotropic medications receive the care they need and that all foster children receive appropriate services that might prevent a need for those medications. We have a tremendous panel, and we're grateful that everyone is here.
9181	McGuire	Mike	93	R2W5ElFvow0	49	68	Presents the beautiful Central Coast of California along with Assemblymember Williams, and we're here to talk with you about Senate Bill 788. California's coast is truly a world wonder. As we all know, it's natural splendor attracts over 150 million visitors annually.
9182	Galgiani	Cathleen	95	ajUtne5r3JM	532	557	I'd like to respond to that, because I know a little something about that. There is existing technology. Japan came up with the technology for their E5 train sets that run on electric and diesel. So, the opportunity exists for us to utilize either a system like that or something similar where that train set could run on the electrified Caltrain system,
9183	Harper	Matthew	14	-OpN4Uo7BxE	559	571	State agencies should be focused on serving the public and getting the job done, not protecting civil service jobs. We should encourage contracting out for highly specialized or skilled jobs, especially in emergency situations.
9184	Chiu	David	7	Bf9_WjQyNCc	1181	1199	HHS Secretary Dooely, and throughout this report it references the following, "given the diversity of California the task force believes differences by sexual orientation and gender identity should be tracked where data are available. Such data are crucial to eliminating health disparities and informing which strategies and
9185	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	HJEL7SBoV-4	1683	1708	Thank you, any other witnesses in support? Any witnesses in opposition? Seeing and hearing none. Thank you for bringing this bill. It added a dimension that actually back in 2002, wasn't even raised. The world does evolve. Thank you for doing that. Yes, motion by Senator Monning, moving the bill. Senator Leno, any questions?
9186	Williams	Das	12	P6cBeme--dw	30	53	The question is whether we as the State of California ratify that choice and endorse that choice to take one's life and I could agree that there is a point of suffering that we want to allow people to endorse people to avoid, but that is not the criteria in this bill.
9187	Block	Marty	59	75GgF4MuVHk	1972	1995	And that group, equal numbers naturopathic doctors and MDs had far broader scope, that they thought we should grant to naturopathic doctors, than this bill grants even in the original bill granted. And the way the bill now has been amended, and thanks to the Chair and committee, this is just a tiny sliver of the scope that this MDND committee thought that we should give to naturopathic doctors.
9188	Garcia	Cristina	112	Hc7WoMlUJqU	892	912	I have a family I have to support and so I'm gonna put my energy and my efforts elsewhere. I think at the end of the day this idea they're talking about that this is not okay, really to me makes no sense. I think you're going to get a much better qualified employee at the end of the day to make sure you're moving forward and you're getting a lot more for your dollar no matter what that salary is.
9189	Stone	Jeff	26	oGlT-6EtEZU	1788	1808	This is for file items 11, I'm sorry there she is. File item eight, AB 530. File item ten, AB 644. File item 12, AB 824. File item 19 AB 1034. File item 20, AB 1061. And finally, final item AB 27 AJR 18.
9190	Hertzberg	Robert	99	Y13vuRnCz5Y	572	589	Which is the larger ethical issue, ethical issues for doctors, ethical issues for religious groups, training issues where the care folks say that really what's going on here is people who don't have choices the arguments that I heard.
9191	Mullin	Kevin	31	gmSplS1IxCE	1438	1453	Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker and members. AB 516 will modernize California's system of getting license plates on vehicles in order to address the many problems that arise from tens of thousands of vehicles driving around our neighborhoods, freeways, and toll roads without license plates.
9192	Stone	Mark	20	Tqcxk8QJsXU	936	972	Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I want to thank the chair of the Health Committee for spending that the time and energy that it took to craft a real solution to a problem that's been around a long time. The issue of balance billing hurts our constituents in a significant way on a daily basis. 1 in 4 Californians has received a bill that was a surprise to them that they are then struggling to pay.
9193	Hill	Jerry	66	8w4HbL8_L_s	81	98	So basically the question is what is the USGS doing to kind of coordinate the messaging of this so myself, as well as other members of the public, aren't confused and think that, I mean they thought it was going to happen tomorrow, we'd all have apps on our phone and getting the information that was necessary.
9194	Wood	Jim	72	RtQ8dRQaXv0	483	497	Currently there are very few environmental regulations for medical marijuana growers. Adding to that large floursihing and destructive groves by people motivated only by profit, and we are seeing unimaginable environmental damages to the north coast region of the state.
9195	Mitchell	Holly	64	0QEuIEsELpg	892	906	They quoted the CHBRP analysis, and acknowledged that, that these technologies are quote at least as, at least as effective as in-person visits in terms of health outcomes in diagnostic accuracy.
9196	Lara	Ricardo	107	FUkZtNfL8Qo	1505	1522	Thank you, Madam Chair, presenting SB 7 for our colleague Senator Wolk. SB 7 authorizes the Department of Housing and Community Development to develop and propose standards that require the installation of water submeters in newly constructed apartment buildings.
9197	Chavez	Rocky	83	Bf9_WjQyNCc	597	622	In 1974, the end of the Vietnam War, the military decided to go to the Chevy, GM model, Ford model and manage all our motor transport fleet. They made this huge computer thing and they took a bunch of guys, I was one of the young second lieutenants that went away to school to Georgia and sat there for six weeks and learned how to work this
9198	Hernandez	Roger	37	I210RzVAPYs	526	552	All right, bipartisan love right here. Anyone else, any questions or comments? All right, all right, great. Well, thank you, Senator. Very thoughtful, while we need to make sure these services are exactly where they need to be, the people that need them the most.
9199	Bonta	Rob	85	k8jlrtfy69g	1118	1143	Thank you to all the witnesses and members of the public that participated today, really appreciated your engagement and involvement and participation in today's very important hearing. I really appreciated the different contributions from so many to help amplify and inform today's discussion. I wanna thank assembly member Brown for co-chairing, as well as all of our colleagues who participated, Dr. Wood.
9200	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	myyM8i0TuNI	950	960	Thank you Mr. Dodd. As one who's been through many a lock down, I can share with you that you do kind of feel somewhat vulnerable when you walk out that classroom to lock the door after you've been given notice.
9201	De Leon	Kevin	102	iXqi4cKnhU8	530	547	But before they went live, obviously, there was a lot of kinks in the system and folks were underpaid, overpaid, not paid.  To add injury to insult, the consulting firm in this case had come back and then did an assessment and asked the school district to pay them more money to fix the problem.
9202	Gallagher	James	108	1ddkqgmLsnY	909	928	Senator, I've been looking over your resolution. I think most people agree that we do have a broken immigration system, we have an overly bureaucratic process so I think most agree that we need to do some comprehensive reform of our immigration system.
9203	Hancock	Loni	98	CbiDjtIZ5Og	1404	1416	We'd just like to note and give a reminder that this was originally a 2014, 15 BCP, so it was planned to transition to the 12 week academy. Long ago, over a year ago.
9204	Gordon	Richard	117	NNzDQCiG5UU	804	826	Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Stanford University is in the heart of my district and today in the gallery we're joined by a public policy class from Stanford. They're here with their Professor, a former member of this state Assembly, Joe Nation. Mr. Nation represented Marin County for three terms beginning in the year 2000.
9205	Chau	Ed	116	tr961U921gU	411	428	Seeing none, let's bring up our panelists. Let's start with our first panelist, and she is Claudia Cappio, who is the Director of the Department of Housing and Community Development, or HCD for short. Good morning Claudia. Welcome to our panel.
9206	Nguyen	Janet	65	WJQRNP9q0xQ	1547	1566	You would have to go through Sequa and EIR process, and it could cost you $50,000 just to do the re-, you know, rehab or changing activities within a park. Not changing the park at all. You would have to go through a Sequa. It would cost about two years to through EIR.
9207	Berryhill	Tom	54	3CsrxcXxpcI	690	706	One, it will replace the current calendar year license with one that is good for 12 consecutive months. This provision has been supported by this committee twice before, so I'm hoping that the third time's a charm, and that we can get this thing through today.
9208	Dodd	Bill	71	6dKd_uGq3Mo	1099	1109	Yeah, I jut think that any could be removed and it would still have the same full force of what the, the intent as mentioned by the committee staff.
9209	Bonta	Rob	85	18KrvNelSZQ	439	446	I wanna ask the members of the public to keep their comments to less than a minute. I'll let you know when you have 10 seconds left. Thank you.
9210	Bonilla	Susan	3	yLYXPq0fwvY	1528	1539	Yes, I think that Senator Hill hit the nail on the head. The Safe Harbor Bill has been working. We need it to continue to work. It's going to have to contain some kind of transition timing.
9211	Pan	Richard	96	h3qpDny4S5o	1198	1213	That would hardly be like we're throwing money out the window. What are we going to do so that starting in the next fiscal year that we actually at least make a step in the right direction we can stop the suffering that we can stop what's been happening.
9212	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	iK2wNSKHbWs	154	167	Thank you. And I should just start by saying this bill comes from my own experience as a high school teacher for many years, and witnessing the experiences of my students, and this is my way of bringing my classroom experience to the committee.
9213	Thurmond	Tony	4	VuyRexRzUE4	87	104	Having said that I'd like to get our work underway and I'd like to give the members of our committee an opportunity if they wish to make any opening remarks.
9214	McGuire	Mike	93	iJc5cTYtc4Q	506	521	So saying that the agriculture, aviation, boating, etc, off road. Clarifying here. Think it should go into roads or stay in with a silo they should be invested in.
9215	Bates	Pat	58	vppxPTwkbs8	324	345	We will not get something passed in this legislature, unless the people out in our cities, in our counties know that the money's coming to them and it's coming to the priorities in their regions. And here with us today, yes one of my mentors, Will Kempton who was our Executive Director of the Orange County Transportation Authority upon which I sat.
9216	Chiu	David	7	0LdXFnPqPCk	1816	1856	Going to file item 6, AVR 27. We will pass and retain that item. We've already dispensed with file item 7, ACR 28. File item 8, ACR 31, we will also pass and retain. This concludes our business on the daily file. At this time we will move to our announcements and adjournments in memory. I'd like to recognize Mr. Jones-Sawyer for your adjourn in memory.
9217	Waldron	Marie	29	b_pUZDCcfig	538	561	Thank you, Mr. Chair. For the author and the witnesses, generally we're talking about young women, you know, who would find themselves obviously in this predicament. And they're sometimes the part of the invincible, you know, they don't, they're not used to getting health care, they haven't done that.
9218	Leyva	Connie	62	7E5hMfSVPig	941	963	So maybe a little more transparency. I wanna make sure it goes back to that toolbox and that we're using all the tools we have in that toolbox. And it really does seem like DTSC has some very powerful tools to use, and that we need to bring those to bear, that there are some violators who look at the fines that they receive as just a cost of doing business.
9219	Burke	Autumn	6	22umnOjFd7E	1440	1453	We'll continue to work with your staff and the administration, while the bill is on suspense, to iron out any inconsistencies or issues that may have inflated the estimated cost of implementation, and I respectfully request your aye vote at the appropriate time.
9220	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	6y6CtxPlgMo	1937	1950	who has funded actually a Title IX lawsuits against cheerleading being a sport. It's incredible. And so we just wanna ensure that things change. And so this was the only avenue we could do it is by sitting down with CIF and saying we're gonna need
9221	Hancock	Loni	98	nYFVQGIL98Y	731	753	This bill is the kind of coaching that we do with beginning teachers sometimes and it's so important for their success and retention in the field. We know that.  To enable this training for young officers and make sure that they're field trainers are prepared for their important responsibilities.
9222	Waldron	Marie	29	vsNWmpwObU4	711	739	I mean, when I look at how I price my product, I have to look at everything from what it cost for me to turn the lights on, to my employees, to not only just the cost of the good, what goes into the product itself, but, you know, your bill with the amendments would be what I would consider what we use for when we design the product. And when we, you know, all the, the, the setups and all the things that go into creating it.
9223	Eggman	Susan Talamantes	73	REI9w9xwFAI	1311	1328	it to be more convenient for the Legislature to tackle this issue next year. People die every day looking for something like this. As people said, people of means have greater access to be able to do things. This provides an option where everybody living in California.
9224	Fuller	Jean	49	8GUUuCOIXCY	1101	1130	Up and down the Valley that has created huge anguish. And so I'd just like to start out with, constituents in the Valley almost all have a story of a child who has either experienced rejection or fears rejection, has carried an enormous debt from actually getting in, or having long enrollment duration, because they can't get the classes that they need and they don't have the counseling support, or whatever.
9225	Thurmond	Tony	4	gW4lj5dmrVY	60	80	I'm also interested, for many reasons, including my own personal experiences, having served for many years as a social worker in the Regional Center community at both Golden Gate Regional Center and at the Regional Center of the East Bay. And having worked in supported living as an overnight attendant in supported living.
9226	Quirk	Bill	23	7YJsJzsFEpM	100	137	Consent calendar's been adopted. And then, we have one other easy part of our business, and that is Huff. SB 420, it's been agreed that we will, do you have the exact language? Yeah, we're sending the bill to interim study. In particular, this has to do with human trafficking.
9227	Leyva	Connie	62	GE9yKeDoFKQ	13	29	Thank you. Good afternoon, Mr. Chair and members. I would first like to thank the Chair and the Committee staff for helping me make this a better bill, and I will be happy to take the suggested amendment.
9228	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	vpNS8YXwTNY	1793	1810	On a hope and a whim and a prayer, and certainly we kind of put our heads together and NASA stepped forward. We had a man on the moon within a decade. So I don't think the notion that we're asking too much is something that really is part of the California, or should be part of the California lexicon.
9229	Nguyen	Janet	65	kbDiQqGDHBM	1923	1938	Thank you Mr President. SB 150 will assist former students of Corinthian colleges by exempting them from state income tax unforgiven state loans. This bill recieved unanimous bipartisan support when it was heard on this floor and has received no "no" votes in the Assembly.
9230	Hill	Jerry	66	92Qm5msEnYk	192	201	There are a number of issues that have been raised in the Sunset Review that I think need to be addressed and as you know the recommendation is to Sunset the Board.
9231	McGuire	Mike	93	D1U0Ojzunqk	776	805	We had one proposition, 215 that passed with no regulation. And we now are paying the consequences for that. We have an opportunity this year to be able to establish the framework, which both the Assembly and the Senate are working on. Which I do believe that we need to continue working together to have one bill. That would then lead the discussion leading into 2016 into potential initiative for legalization recreational use. You're absolutely right.
9232	Beall	Jim	92	Ol0PhdDSV8c	1605	1618	Another, another goal if we want to talk about strategy because your the overview group so strategic perspective is the mindset of consumers towards what we're trying to do?
9233	Leyva	Connie	62	QmHhObaXRjg	493	513	I just quickly wanted to say, again that we are working with the controller's office. And folks who live in mobile homes, by and large. Welcome. Folks by and large that live in mobile homes live there because they can't afford to live in a single-family home. So we just wanna make sure that they are afforded the same rights as people who live in a single-family home.
9234	Bonta	Rob	85	ok4qN3L6USs	1349	1363	I just want to thank you all for seeing the importance of this bill. There are huge federal dollars as has been stated that are being left on the table that we can leverage. It's six to 10 times the leverage of federal dollars when there's state input.
9235	Stone	Jeff	26	cRT-vVNBfAE	1129	1150	And I can tell you with the partnership of the State of California, the Federal Government, developers that pay a habitat fee, we've acquired over 45,000 acres of critical habitat. And of course budgets have been strained because you don't have development, you don't get the developmental fees which means you don't get that extra money to buy habitat.
9236	Pavley	Fran	104	YrZrpwtmLSQ	1644	1660	Years ago California spent $40 million or more a year in loan assumption or loan forgiveness programs that really made a difference, and the way those worked is sort of built on what this bill is talking about is looking back, were they successful?
9237	Beall	Jim	92	MJK7k1iHpMk	1025	1050	I'd like to know what the socio-economic ethnic status of those people on the waiting list are. I'd I also like to know just the data. We need that data on that and also respond to Senator Lara's comment, I think it's I think it's very interesting it'd be very interesting to see the ethnic and social economic status of the law school admissions over the past couple decades.
9238	Kim	Young	82	NRrL3g0f7-g	752	778	to Montessori schools, and at age three, four, five, studying at Montessori schools, they probably learned a lot more than what they were able to get if they started earlier in kindergarten, in my view, because I have four kids, like I said. And I have been able to send my kids all through the public schools except for the last one
9239	Levine	Marc	8	yAgUQvRrkrQ	375	391	Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members. One of the worst bottlenecks in the Bay Area evening commute occurs on highway 101 north and interstate 580 east approaching the Richmond San Rafael Bridge. To address this, the Bay Area toll authority under the MTC is proposing to add a third lane to the bridge eastbound evening peak commute.
9240	Mitchell	Holly	64	7VfcnWx6nzU	1122	1137	It is very clear to me by looking at the manual that the ethics training around asset forfeiture that's currently included in their training, almost all restrictions and rules in the manual, apply to criminal asset forfeiture.
9241	McGuire	Mike	93	Pvh7fZV71H4	904	921	21% for the 20 non-hub commercials, so that's Oxnard, Sonoma County, Crescent City. 14% for the six medium-hub, Sacramento, Oakland, and San Jose, for example, and 31% for the small-hub commercial airports, Fresno, Long Beach, Palm Springs, and Santa Barbara.
9242	Brown	Cheryl	13	yVd5ZErYEYE	640	659	I know that there are these programs that are evidence-based, but the community knows and that's the evidence. So whenever you're doing the RFPs, I hope you'll keep that in mind. And lastly, I'd like to say to the young man who spoke today.
9243	Block	Marty	59	fryb4ejit1s	43	65	Today we're going to look at the Prop 98 budget that the Governor's proposed. The 2015-16 budget proposal. We'll  hear highlights of the Governor's proposal, first from  the Department of Finance. Then we'll get a response and reaction from the Legislative Analyst's Office, and finally we have the Department of Education comment as well.
9244	Nguyen	Janet	65	gDPCmEU7pmg	136	157	That tool is not gonna help for these individuals, these neighborhoods, especially if they're newcomers of a particular immigrant community that are just barely developing and so what you have right now, I don't know if it would stop or gives that ability to these residents.
9245	Kim	Young	82	LTEBLbyRjnQ	1589	1600	You're doing this after school hours, and you're doing this in addition to your school courses, so I think there is a lot of the commitment that you are making here.
9246	Mitchell	Holly	64	9eBx3f-E0dc	76	107	I'd like to thank all of the advocacy organizations and think tanks who have put some amazing documents together for us that are available on the select committees website currently. Some amazing white papers on the status of poverty in California today. Everyone from Child Action to Children's Defense Fund to the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities, they're just a number of amazing organizations who've done incredible work on this overall global issue of poverty.
9247	Mullin	Kevin	31	a4X1msw4NL8	1735	1747	Thank you Mr. Chiu. Seeing no discussion on the item, clerk will open the roll. All members vote who desire to vote.  All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote.
9248	Anderson	Joel	57	ZM99l_dNJfs	1710	1727	I ran a bill, speaking to your point, I ran a bill when I first got up here and said the next time you reprint the ballots that it would say they must be mailed before Election Day and received so that we wouldn't undercount these ballots.
9249	De Leon	Kevin	102	BHYxE3t9U1s	189	214	Okay, your confirmation in the Rules Committee passes on a four to zero vote. What we'll do is we'll move your appointment to the Senate floor for a full confirmation vote. Congratulations.
9250	Stone	Jeff	26	u9WQRBoV7yg	797	837	I feel it's interesting timing that we would consider this resolution considering my opposition to the 35 spot bills, bills that had no content in them only to be used in June, maybe as late as June the 14 as we embark on passing a major piece of legislation, the budget, which is going to limit participation by the public to know exactly what w'ere voting on and to express support or opposition to spending over $100 billion of taxpayer money.
9251	Nielsen	Jim	68	vuTgADMvFlA	377	388	Well on the most recent point, it concerns me that we're trying to cram a lot of stuff into a special session, wherein we do not have enough time to do it.
9252	Hertzberg	Robert	99	6e0LFFmZAnE	1660	1674	And so when I consulted the best experts, it really was this catalog, this inventory of where we go to start to say are there commonalities? Are there things that people can do with government with a payroll system, or whatever else it may be, to make it work better?
9253	Hernandez	Ed	103	_fj8pVeO8ic	359	373	This bill would require the Department of Healthcare services submit an application to the Federal Senators for Medicare and Medicaid services for a waiver that continues the states momentum and success and innovation achieved under the current bridged reform waiver.
9254	Stone	Mark	20	B4ry1_3tU0U	1700	1725	Either because there was a bias against a person who is transgender potentially serving on that jury or if the defendant or a person being accused was transgender that it's a mechanism to remove a transgender person from the jury. That was being used as an argument in favor of changing peremptory challenges.
9255	Nielsen	Jim	68	TtIXT0N3vvo	1849	1868	Yeah, okay, well, put me down as a little bit skeptical about this, the openness. I know how this legislative process has often worked lately, not always, but sometimes.
9256	Leno	Mark	60	N5kRSRB-qaQ	147	163	The bill does not ban any chemicals. It does allow for the free market to work at its very best when consumers have the knowledge to make purchases of what they would like.
9257	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	eibZ1b56Plc	492	513	Well first of all the section of the bill that is now being opposed was never a part of their original opposition. They were only concerned about the dispersants issue which we more than I think generously extended to them. Their concerns now have resulted in a notification issue,
9258	Leno	Mark	60	GIcgVGMKBjg	1620	1655	There is a rule making process for this, and he gave us great assurance that the concerns raised with respect to this process would be addressed through regulation. The authority does not amend any due process laws, so I think that should, should mitigate any concerns anyone has with regard to these diversions and the authority given in this bill to the Department of Fish and Wildlife, again new, unauthorized, deleterious diversions.
9259	Nielsen	Jim	68	fMvnlUAhyII	51	72	I guess this is my fundamental point, as it relates to continued victimization, the sanctions taken per that. Be that community supervision, be that whatever, revocation, returned to custody, recommit.
9260	Roth	Richard	106	cRT-vVNBfAE	2084	2107	Well, I'm trying to understand this. I'm looking. Of course, we're doing this on the fly, which is always a good way to do it. In looking at something that's called the legislative council's digest, it says existing law. Existing law regulates real property acquired, blah, blah, blah, and requires the Department of Fish and Wildlife, blah, blah, blah to annually pay to the county
9261	Leno	Mark	60	y2dm_Q__xog	38	59	To bring it under the Smoke Free Act as well as the STAKE Act, the Stop Tobacco Access to Kids Enforcement Act. And by doing so, keeps everything under the same infrastructure, statutory infrastructure, which will save the state and businesses money. For example, the STAKE Act savings, the Department of Public Health's division overseeing
9262	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	l95CGtQiXY4	256	274	There were some things were very troubling to me when I first got here and I'm very sensitive to the fact that there have been perceived budget cuts of a billion dollars or more to the court since 2008.
9263	Hall	Isadore	1	OIbMOKdbCjk	1257	1283	Yes thank you madame President. As Vice Chair of the California Legislative Black Caucus, I also rise present ACR 5, which designates that January 19 2015 be observed and was observed as the official memorial of the late Doctor Martin King Junior and commemorates the work of Doctor King in the civil rights movement in changing public policy in California and throughout the United States of America. I respectfully ask for your aye vote on ACR 5. Thank you.
9264	Hill	Jerry	66	oqt8nfX8ybk	276	291	The PUC has stated that all of its cases have been on time for the past four years, even though some have been held open for years, requiring the PUC to reach out broadly to interest in groups, not just the utilities, before opening proceedings.
9265	Pan	Richard	96	PAOgANPSZH0	1200	1218	He was devoted to God, his church, his family, his friends. Greg had a balanced love that touched all that he met, and he's survived by his wife, Candy, and his son, Vinny,  parents, and he's also survived by his brother's two brothers and sisters and many other family members who shared is love. Thank you.
9266	Waldron	Marie	29	0pvN33z5LJg	1209	1226	The Prescriber Prevails Act is not a dispense-as-written free-for-all. Prescriber Prevails is implemented for four specific controlled drug classes with a prior auth process and appeals under all prior authorization requests, not all patients.
9267	Monning	Bill	25	43PD-O5b090	797	823	But we're talking about a contract, where there's a deposit and there's provisions in the contract about how some of that deposit might be applied during the time of the occupancy. But if the person ceases tenancy or occupancy based on death or by moving, the contract also provides that whatever remaining part of the deposit their entitled to shall be returned.
9268	Pavley	Fran	104	XCFU_0j8dAo	1472	1481	I'd be glad to move the bill, but I just had a question how this works. So, the Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction Fund has X number of dollars going to high speed rail.
9269	Dahle	Brian	47	Ymyy28wzVQk	1675	1706	I know that you've worked with some my northern water associations, didn't see them here today but I'm going to take your word and I did talk to David Guy from the NACWA who said they support the bill in its original form so it's changed since then so I haven't had an opportunity to talk to him since then, but I'm going to support your bill out and will reserve my right to protect north state water versus water going -- coming from the south so just want to let you be aware that, you know, water is a very tough issue.
9270	Dahle	Brian	47	Ymyy28wzVQk	1654	1675	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to say I've seen this bill twice now and it's substantially changed in this -- the last amendment. I had a lot of concerns about my district in the north of the delta, I should say, having to make up water that may be taken from some other area to make the delta whole.
9271	Beall	Jim	92	Q9Mn4k8Lves	625	647	So I think this is a very important issue that we address, I applaud the author, this is a first step. We need to do a lot more with the accreditation process for our community colleges. The federal and state laws, I think the idea that we have an appeal process, I think that's the one technical issue.
9272	Alejo	Luis	9	xdTTK0YoutY	1233	1263	So in that same line when I look at this resolution, it's also about recognizing what has happened in the past and the story of Larry Itilong was often left out when books were written about the farmer worker rights movement. I was proud also two years ago to bring his son John Itliong, who brought here to the capital the original flag of AWOC, agriculture workers organizing Committee, that was held by his father Larry Itliong.
9273	Patterson	Jim	119	Ai7oaVN8l2E	1900	1918	Right now, I think some of our analysis when we look at it on the floor may have an oppose unless amended, I'd like to ask if we could with Farm Bureau and with the Forest folks work through some of this, so that we don't have that choice on the floor, that we actually have some solutions to it, and I would encourage that, thank you.
9274	Bloom	Richard	2	MhEV1ONtJ2I	358	380	There are instances where if we had gotten to... if we'd had the opportunity to implement best management practices from the get-go, your audits would be a lot thinner and we could probably downscale your department a little bit. Little bit. How do we get there?
9275	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	_wQgbHlbFh8	74	96	Existing law protects the privacy of California residents in their homes, both by prohibiting others from entering onto their lands without permission where one has a reasonable expectation of privacy. This bill clarifies how these long-standing principles of trespass and privacy apply to unmanned aircraft.
9276	Garcia	Eduardo	38	ejG5Ru6MX_o	31	57	No announcements, there are four bills on file and we are going to give Senator Nielsen courtesy to come to forward and present his bill. We don't have anything on the consent calendar and there is no list of supplemental information or documents. So at this time we'll introduce Mr. Nielsen, he's got Item 2 on the agenda: SB 159 California Disabled Veteran Business Enterprise Program. Welcome.
9277	Leno	Mark	60	iWvzcXZipI0	1354	1375	Thank you. Just pursuing the issue of cost a little bit further. Do we have a cost per inmate in the New York program for either GED or two-year of four-year degrees? Is there any way to begin to identify what kind of cost we're talking about?
9278	Hernandez	Ed	103	Wk2WIga5Dho	512	529	Thank you. Opposition? Comments, questions from any of the members? See no comments. Is there a motion? So moved by Senator Pan. Chair is recommending a support. Would you like to close please?
9279	Quirk	Bill	23	KMXnTjJiK-4	1063	1099	We've heard a lot about the camera information and now we're now going to hear from Stewart McKey, who is the National Technology Officer for Microsoft Corporation. He is going to discuss storage and retention considerations from a technical point of view I will give the sergeants a few minutes to clear the tables here.
9280	De Leon	Kevin	102	8E9La7s73fc	508	525	But here were are today in 2015 well on our way to reaching those targets. We commend the IOUs collectively. They will probably easily surpass their 30% RPS portfolio even before the year 2020.
9281	Calderon	Ian Charles	115	Mfs9_24i5lo	595	609	But they also are parents and they have kids. And a major determining factor, especially me representing a lower income area, lower to moderate-income area is in how well kids do in schools.
9282	Frazier	Jim	114	FMt4j4ajPsQ	1445	1453	Test find support has caught governor representing the Construction Employer's Association also says Ardios of our State Building Trades. I thankful I thank you and respectfully ask for your aye vote.
9283	McGuire	Mike	93	nqU0Ufhmqoo	1387	1403	And according to the Association for Career in Technical Education, 90% of students who are concentrating in CTE programs, graduate high school. That's compared to an average freshmen graduation rate of 75%.
9284	Berryhill	Tom	54	GIcgVGMKBjg	1239	1260	But, evidently, evidently there's enough bad news in this Bill, AB 92. that it can't be supported by either NAQUA or the Farm Bureau and, you know, one of the reasons is every time we do one of these emergency bills, what we really do is expand the authority of government.
9285	Chau	Ed	116	mxsKkg9J8wc	762	779	Absolutely, let me briefly respond to the earlier question about statistics. According, if I could point you to the report in fact by the consultant, it points out that there was a survey done recently. Of 760 respondents who took the survey, they found out that 400 reported,
9286	Beall	Jim	92	u6fOz6AZ8WM	0	24	Thank you. Mark Watts is representing Transportation California, and interesting enough, I first met Mark way back when, when the last gas tax was being considered, and I chaired the transportation committee for the California League of cities.
9287	Moorlach	John	4657	m8iyuGdEmL0	1491	1511	One is that, that this is a, I, I love this bill. I mean everything is great about this bill I, I just had trouble with the amount or size of the tax credit so I had a chance to meet with Senator Roth this morning, and even recommended the appropriate staff to meet with so I I've had a good chat with them as well
9288	Pavley	Fran	104	oaFR61I7UCg	116	140	The consent calendar has been approved, but we'll leave the file open for absent members to add on. So, let's begin with file item one, Assembly Bill 96 by Speaker Toni Atkins. This relates to animal products, on the sale of ivory and rhinoceros horns. And the custom and practice in this committee, I think perhaps being a former middle school teacher
9289	Bates	Pat	58	90yWX-I7oeQ	585	602	I have with me this morning, or this afternoon Kim Madsen an executive officer and Rosanne Helms, Legislative Analyst with the board of behavioral sciences to provide support and certainly technical details as to the contents of the bill and any questions that you might have.
9290	Wood	Jim	72	dfinQbvsuZo	43	58	MFTs are recognized by the state as MediCal providers, but are not recognized as such in clinics for the purpose of billing. AB 858 also addresses the issue of not reimbursing for a mental health visit on the same day as a medical visit.
9291	Bates	Pat	58	uKMBP4F7FFc	987	1008	Thank you, Chairman, I just respectfully ask that it receive your support to move from suspense for a full discussion on the Assembly floor. I just want to see that these guys are not going to be able to game the system and in particular, put our children at risk. I think we all know all the predatory nature of many of them and that really needs to be reined in. So I thank you for your time.
9292	Pan	Richard	96	2mUHw1EX7J4	1775	1797	And when we talk about, we can talk about the 130 some people who got measles, but there's many other people who got exposed as I mentioned in my testimony. We have been fortunate to be able to have an era where we did not have to see signs in stores telling you that if you went to this store you might be exposed to a disease like measles or some other disease.
9293	Mathis	Devon	75	mYMmmzreoTQ	706	717	I'm also the Vice President of the Veterans Committee. It's a privilege to hear you all come and make your way here to speak and to address the issues.
9294	Monning	Bill	25	msMPqU5kPd8	807	826	So, if you look at statistics. And you're making a decision for the benefit of public health, you choose between four and a million with an adverse reaction, versus fatalities among those who remain unvaccinated.
9295	Gallagher	James	108	7KrRcZ9ORsY	770	787	that there are some constitutional issues with this legislation and probably most on point would be the Evergreen case that was before the second circuit where New York City had a similar type
9296	Beall	Jim	92	ckv1hzYbS0w	1346	1362	And I know that we started to work on that last, Richard,  with your staff and setting up a unit - how's that going? Can you give us sort of a status of that. What is happening with that particular item and maybe some of the other agencies as well.
9297	Pan	Richard	96	2mUHw1EX7J4	1761	1775	We are protecting the right to an education. We have worked hard to do that. We are not segregating them. We realize that people who are making choices, there are consequences associated with it to protect the public.
9298	Frazier	Jim	114	fSCMT0VJDKw	440	451	In addition, teenage drivers have the highest rate of involvement in crashes that result in the death of other people, such as their passengers, pedestrians, or drivers and passengers in other vehicles.
9299	Cooper	Jim	21	WE6m9wVcbNQ	150	162	Well, the bottom line, I guess it comes down to, if this passes today, if this bill goes through and passes what does it do? These folks can still buy their vape cigarettes. Nothing changes. This puts it in legislation where it defines it as a tobacco product. So to me, in my mind, it doesn't really change anything. They can still buy it. They can still sell it.
9300	Eggman	Susan Talamantes	73	xlFASx7RMqI	663	674	And again, I know families have been frustrated, often times clients after the fact have been frustrated, and treatment providers have been frustrated, if they're not able to look at the history of danger and what they are able to term eminent.
9301	Hueso	Ben	48	knCQGn-OW5c	0	19	Thank you senator. Our next speaker is Maria Ariza. Maria is a CEO of the Mexican Association of Private Equity and Venture Capital Funds. She also worked as an associate at Naften fund of Mexico. A private equity fund investing in medium sized Mexican companies.
9302	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	QnBcTK-as8k	935	960	The department of Fair Employment and Housing estimates costs of about $686,000 dollars and there are unknown costs, to the Department of Developmental Services, but the savings would be far greater by providing job protected leave and allowing more workers to  access California's Paid Family Leave Program, that only they, the workers, contribute to.
9303	Gomez	Jimmy	80	rzSOQHmJW3U	513	531	Do pass with amendments to shorten sunset period to three years. And include additional detail to reporting requirements on raffle fundraising and charities benefit, and team and foundation charitable giving from activities other than raffles. A roll call.
9304	Leno	Mark	60	gvsFAuMIegs	1609	1628	I think we've done a reasonable job there and I agree, we have to restore rates and we have to cover the cost, but no minimum wage bill, historically or prospectively, is going to have an appropriation in it. That will happen through the budget process, it's my intent to make sure, I would never leave these people high and dry.
9305	Ting	Philip	30	6UU1hF1F-fc	186	202	So for all of us who've taken a ride to the airport or taken a ride to downtown San Francisco or downtown LA, and said hey, wouldn't it be nice to split the cost or share the ride with somebody? This is the technology we've been waiting for. It's a great win for drivers, it makes them more money.
9306	Nielsen	Jim	68	4l8d3tner_c	1245	1261	Well, it's a part of our usual business around here, that budget deals are brought, and that was a part of the plan to get us out of the problem situation in the 24-month clock. The minute we get to the 24-month clock, oh well, we'll expand it, it doesn't make any difference.
9307	Lara	Ricardo	107	ZhE_hzRecAQ	1958	1987	The fact is that voter registration does matter in California. In 2012, California ranked 38th in voter registration. We have more than 6.6 million eligible voters that still aren't registered to vote. This bill will get us closer to closing that gap and ensuring that we continue to promote our democratic process here in California. I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
9308	Patterson	Jim	119	79bMZ-eNloc	1419	1449	Because cities I represent, two and three and four years ago, did things that did significantly reduce consumption, but the arbitrary nature of choosing the particular year upon which the benchmark is made ignores what has gone on previous, literally tens of millions of dollars worth of projects and improvements and methodologies.
9309	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	gT2_z9UGrSs	1775	1792	But the journey is not yet completed. It is a long road, and AB 1020 is another step on that journey. Nothing establishes equality more than simply a guarantee that every student get an equal amount of instructional time from California's credentialed teachers.
9310	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	gT2_z9UGrSs	1754	1774	Supreme Court Justice, California's Earl Warren delivered the decision in an unambiguous terms. In the field of eduction, the doctrine of separate but equal has no place. We should all be proud that California's Constitution enshrines the right of an equal education should be available to every student.
9311	Beall	Jim	92	hQoyRwEukvY	782	801	So securing a concept that we wanna have the funds secure, not rateable if you wanna say that, locked in, is exactly what we need to do to prevent what I talked about earlier, when you have chaos in the funding, you're going to have chaos in the programs.
9312	De Leon	Kevin	102	8as6rPb5Xb0	256	274	Mexican-Americans, 44.6%, roughly about, what, 55% of these kids are not proficient in English or Math. And Other Latino, 48.7%, we'll round it off to 49%, so say 51%.
9313	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	qjDm_sZ-lfo	1783	1800	This would prohibit attorneys from applying for existing DACA. That, it's not in the bill. And so, I don't want to add that, I don't want to mess up our bill with things. Why would that be a situation? They brought up attorney client privilege. It has nothing to do with attorney client privilege.
9314	Gaines	Ted	24	WnmFSvHbO0k	1652	1671	Seeing none, ayes 37, noes zero. Measure passes. Members, let's move forward now to file item 44. Senator Hall, are you ready bring this measure forward? Secretary, please read.
9315	Hernandez	Ed	103	R5jZe-4pYBI	1450	1468	So, let me just follow up on the comment you made that the nurse, midwives wanna work with hospitals to see these patients. Again, let me commend the Assembly member because I think you've done an excellent job in your presentation and obviously, you're very, very passionate.
9316	Allen	Benjamin	70	gGO-NA0OnUA	573	593	As a result, the Department of Fish and Wildlife was ordered to conduct an environmental review of the activity, and in 2009, the legislature temporarily banned suction dredge mining until that review was complete, and in 2011, it called in the department to require full mitigation of the environmental impacts before issuing a mining permit.
9317	Stone	Jeff	26	Ga_QNYq_wVM	1813	1831	Not the way that it was written. Okay, so in San Diego there were conflicts and certainly the opponents bring up very good points that we don't want homeless sex offenders, certainly preying on our youth and it seems as though, this bill has done a couple of things.
9318	McGuire	Mike	93	aMmnutMx8lk	164	177	Yes, good morning Madam Chair. First of all I want to thank you and your fantastic committee, in particular Mr. Craven for all of the work. I do accept the committee's amendment, and yes ma'am, it is within the district.
9319	Beall	Jim	92	Zz925hDmty8	710	737	I think, and maybe just reflecting on what I said earlier, people don't realize how essential it is not to have the Highland Hospital be inundated with Medi-Cal, because the neighboring hospital that took Medi-Cal was closed or was endangered. I think that's very important to remember.
9320	Pavley	Fran	104	w3XqiN30Dys	825	840	It has six votes. Well we'll leave that open consent calendar though is approved.  Senator de Leon, Senate Bill 317, Safe Neighborhood Parks Act. And we have several people have come up from the L.A. area for this.
9321	Wolk	Lois	94	oTonvRu6EKM	952	963	Thank you. All right, I just have one question, and then we'll close it for the day. And that was the question that I posed in the very beginning that I hoped you would deal with, and that's the issue of pricing.
9322	Runner	Sharon	4656	RORFPzwiDnU	1228	1241	So at that point, I would think every assault should probably be reported to law enforcement. They could find out early, so I'm kind of on the opposite side, like usual, Senator.
9323	Olsen	Kristin	15	_YQzP7dcJFI	1441	1460	As the author said, stem careers are expected to grow by 19% in California just in the next 10 years. We also know that the stem workforce is essential to filling the demands of our new innovative modern economy. It's really important that we work so hard in our education system and our business community to address the skills gap that exist today so that these great companies can start to hire more and more Californians.
9324	Pavley	Fran	104	gafvxHeAnpk	1002	1018	Has anyone been there in the last year? Actually been. Do we have enough people to really document? Because I don't want to keep opening up the paper and find out that from 2009 till last year we have no clue what's going on.
9325	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	nugSHhjUz14	1821	1857	Also, for the first time, we're also providing $10 million support grant for community groups providing service to human trafficking victims. As many of us have been working on on our committee, one of the biggest problem that we right now have is human trafficking, it's taking us over like a tsunami. We need to provide, not only resources, but we have to provide resources in a unique way. This is not the typical type of crime that we've dealt with in the past, and so we have to handle this in a different way. Community groups are doing some innovative things to ensure that.
9326	Wagner	Donald	88	hrVBNy8V670	1762	1776	Well. Thank you. You touched on something I wanted to bring up. We did just consider the Eggman's bill and I'm not sure if it's necessarily going in, if two of you are necessarily going in different directions. She's got a bill that I think goes off to approps.
9327	Wolk	Lois	94	pmiSwefin48	426	447	know, doesn't realize that the extraordinary benefits that could come from many of these areas particularly in wetlands, agriculture forestry protection and, compost reduction, all of that and water conservation absolutely so, all of that's good so, I wish you.
9328	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	j1Gi-ueVYBU	667	680	They don't fly necessarily that fast and, you know, if you find out whose drone it is, rather than go shoot the thing down, you get to bring an action for a civil trespass. It's not a criminal trespass at this point.
9329	Roth	Richard	106	ewcXToh_gOY	1656	1672	These are Armory properties that are deemed no longer suitable for California National Guard soldiers. They've reached the end of their service life and are no longer, frankly, practical or safe for the National Guard soldiers to assemble and train in.
9330	Stone	Jeff	26	nfRac3nHOas	1092	1106	And as a result, our jails became congested. Right now, twenty five percent of our jail space is taken up by people that have been sentenced as kind of state prisoners--more than a year.
9331	Gomez	Jimmy	80	qbDN-8u61LI	1737	1760	And I think that we can reach a dual-house solution to this problem. But, I'm gonna vote for the bill. I was gonna lay off, but I'm gonna vote for the bill. But knowing, just to kind of let you know that we'll be paying close attention as this bill comes to appropriations on my side.
9332	Hueso	Ben	48	J_Iq4rTF6rc	1532	1546	There, there have been some requests. Is that a yes? We haven't, we haven't, accepted. The requests have been made. But it's possible that there may be, may be another property that's, under the jurisdiction of, of the courts.
9333	Atkins	Toni	110	4MjmF7EnXtg	125	138	Finally, eight of the ten state conservancies in California are permanent agencies. We think the time has come for the San Diego River Conservancy to join with its fellow conservancies as a permanent agency of the state.
9334	McGuire	Mike	93	1VsIgdliTQw	1402	1419	We specify exact shipping requirements including manifest with unique ideas and specific license locations for pickup and delivery. That's a must. A physical copy other manifests must be with the transporter at all times, and of course the shipment will be tracked with the track and trace program.
9335	Grove	Shannon	77	xhI7BgS1JK0	1263	1281	Or the homeowner who has property you know, that's not directly by a fire hydrant or, you know, ranch property that can't be, they price that risk higher for obvious reasons. It's not close to water, the fire, the fire department, or anything like that, so.
9336	McGuire	Mike	93	1VsIgdliTQw	1436	1453	This tax would be above and beyond the sales tax and any excise tax, but this tax we need to be approved by local voters. Finally, I want to thank the pro team and the chair of appropriations and the chair of health for their amazing work on this bill.
9337	Beall	Jim	92	suW9diU5Tzo	1651	1678	SB 484 will flag group homes that rely on psychotropic medications as the first line or the only treatment. The bill also convenes the foster youth ombudsman and stakeholders to establish a methodology to identify those group homes that have disproportionally high levels of unnecessary psychotropic drug use. I urge and I vote on this measure.
9338	Roth	Richard	106	8epuGfrU4TQ	1062	1082	Assuming an individual received a 1099 in addition to a W2 for earned wages, why would we not take the 1099 into consideration in any event, whether it adversely or positively impacts the individual. Is that a fair question?
9339	Dodd	Bill	71	AAng3WP84Ks	1080	1100	again in other areas just like this. AJR 4 requests the Secretary of the Interior to respect existing land uses to respect private property in the area and to consult local representatives. More than 200 businesses surrounding the Berryessa Snow Mountain Region have
9340	Hernandez	Roger	37	vYi2KRFuGjg	1242	1262	I really wanna commend the tribe for adopting a compact that yielded labor support. I think that's always a good thing, I know that there's a labor spirit in the leadership of the tribe, I understand that. It is my hope that this can be the standard for compacts that come before us in the future.
9341	Hill	Jerry	66	843OfhKnV14	940	958	Certainly the other commissioners would have had the ability and, I would have thought, the interest to do that because it would make the improvement. I think it's important that the legislature clarify to the commission that that authority is with all the commissioners.
9342	Stone	Jeff	26	c3rIX9MpSXI	708	737	Are you, do you have any innovative communication, software sharing modalities as an example with the Department of Motor Vehicles that could flag somebody that has to go in for their car.  Being registered or driver's license? It flags them as somebody that's not meeting their obligations, as a way to encourage them to.  Fulfill their, their duties. Are we, are we looking at innovative. Measures like that.
9343	Beall	Jim	92	_3f-5R48ZaU	736	759	Yeah, well, we didn't pass it in the Senate so don't, we just had a Committee meeting. I had some questions. Just focus a minute on like looking to the future which is what I keep saying. You know, we're not, we can look to the past but we gotta look to the future.
9344	Liu	Carol	63	6RcHSaSd1rw	1593	1612	SB172 requires schools to reward diplomas to students have met all graduation requirements other than the passage of the exit exam and applies this provision retroactively. We cannot, in good conscience, continue a graduation requirement that no one can meet.
9345	Mullin	Kevin	31	G-cKeAHj51U	506	514	So this 25% figure that you're citing. My understanding was and please correct me if I'm wrong. I'm rifling through this material here, but my understanding was it's 25% turnout below gubernatorial or statewide turnout.
9346	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	mb2tyA5yp6Q	1524	1545	And otherwise, I hope that Congress comes through with a very fair and balanced approach to this. Lawsuits can be abused, but lawsuits are also a way people can protect and enforce their property and their rights. SO, We have to recognize both sides of that coin. So, I just thank you for bringing this forward. Any other comments?
9347	Hertzberg	Robert	99	9GlTqPUGK00	1840	1856	We've seen droughts in 1953, '58, '75, '91, and the current one starting in 2010. Unfortunately, we've seen the San Francisco earthquake in 1906, the earthquake in Los Angeles in '71, '89, and of course Northridge in 1994.
9348	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	9P0OZVf3kdQ	1055	1068	You'll forgive me, you'll forgive me. I think that when it was vetoed last year or the year before, there was a question about cost. Has that been arrested or changed then?
9349	Weber	Shirley	44	Uoe2v6pAgNg	2297	2308	Because it is so extremely diverse and, when I was on the school board we Kenja Ima, who have some of you may know as a researcher. Did a lot of work on the various Asian communities that existed in San Diego.
9350	Chiu	David	7	PPBgSxp7D00	1148	1159	and it's former onerous process in what we're talking about which is essentially the equivalence of a parking ticket. And I want to just turn to over to Mr. Reiskin to see if there's anything more you like to add to that.
9351	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	VyoFcVtTJtQ	844	860	And now SB186 is presented to align the authority of community colleges in order to hold students accountable for sexual assault and sexual battery similar to the authority that is available within the UC and CSU system.
9352	Gomez	Jimmy	80	tC7sJemEjBU	449	455	It's optional. So you don't have to do it and that means that you don't have to have a project labor agreement in place to be able to do it.
9353	Williams	Das	12	R2W5ElFvow0	1044	1064	Thank you. I need to remind witnesses and Senators to tell their witnesses that in this committee testimony is two minutes each. I will add two more minutes onto the oil company's testimony after this, the opposition because we gotta balance that, so please keep testimony under two minutes.
9354	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	hYh0N-NJMx0	858	875	That the communications networks between cities and counties are consistent so that they can look, essentially talk to each other during these important moments and hours after, or while we're addressing one of these emergency situations.
9355	Pan	Richard	96	07ilphfHuEw	1186	1204	So I hope you'll vote for this because it's actually being addressed for the first-time in a significant way in these MOU's. If you like what you see here, if you think that's something should happen, vote for these MOU's so we can say "look legislature supports them and we're going courage the other bargaining units when they come on board that they need to do the same thing."
9356	Beall	Jim	92	IUqqKj1b5UE	1597	1635	If we don't do that, what we're going to have is continuation of what I consider to be disparate healthcare services for people in California and we need to establish some, some evaluation and some rules for this. So I urge an aye vote. I think this I'll continue to work with the opposition, I promise you that. But, but I also think we need to deal with this question. There are literally hundreds of people are affected by this and their basic healthcare is at stake, so we don't want have a despaired healthcare system where people are parked in observation. I urge your aye vote, thank you.
9357	Mitchell	Holly	64	lanFVKv-H-g	97	117	But just, you know, I'm sure many of you will be hitting multiple points, given the fact that we've taken a lot of information. Given the fact that we're asking you to comment on all 13 areas, won't cut the mic, but just really ask that you be cognizant of what's being stated before you.
9358	Beall	Jim	92	8y2PS2BPMgc	520	534	Okay, we'll close the roll. The vote will be 9-0, this motion, this will be returned to the Senate Floor, and motion passed. So we're now adjourned as a Committee.
9359	Stone	Jeff	26	TrPgAQvjTc0	990	1020	My friends we're headed down a path where no one is following us except for Quebec. We have to protect jobs in the State of California. We've had this little upsurge, we have some very strong economic times ahead of us.  This just put yet another nail in the coffin for the business climate in State of California. I respectfully request your no vote on SB32.
9360	Gatto	Mike	46	dSqmLCv394A	302	315	Well, most think tanks think it's only a matter of time before somebody gets your fingerprint and does some mischief with it. Or even worse finds out, I mean in certain cities there's people who live carless and they get around only by ridesharing companies.
9361	Bonta	Rob	85	2HmztWZsIt4	519	528	Okay, the committee can entertain a motion. Oh, I'm sorry, we have a motion and a second. The motion is due passed to appropriations. Madame Secretary, please call the role.
9362	Hancock	Loni	98	t4_AyYAahhk	479	494	I don't know, and I'm really not familiar with what kinds of inflexibility there would be, because I do think full-time faculty teaching the basic skills would be more committed to the students, that have more time to spend with the students.
9363	Gomez	Jimmy	80	22lWaj2Ih1o	1088	1097	Thank you. Questions or comments from the Committee Members? Seeing none, this bill has a motion by Quirk, a second by Bonta, and is on a B roll call. Thank you. Next bill.
9364	Huff	Bob	105	ZPVP4bYij2U	949	958	30 seconds? You know, maybe an interim remedy would be that a school flushes first thing in the morning before school opens until they can get it fixed or afford it.
9365	Mullin	Kevin	31	LXP_ciN3hzY	2073	2087	The clerk will open the roll on the consent calendar. All members vote desire who to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. This is for the consent calendar, members. Find your desks.
9366	Hertzberg	Robert	99	X4Bkp9BrIdE	1194	1207	I can certainly, both, as to this issue, our expert here from Riverside, can maybe enlighten you and add some additional dimension to that if you think that's appropriate.
9367	Galgiani	Cathleen	95	2Dc5I9_7zFA	1191	1208	That's what I'm having trouble with. Looking around, even in Sacramento here, you have apartment complexes where they allow, if you want a garage or if you want a parking space, you have to pay a little extra to have that. Perhaps that's a way to address it.
9368	Mitchell	Holly	64	1fof-e9skdQ	679	706	And parents would call and ask to make sure the family day care provider didn't smoke because their children are asthmatic, to make sure that the family day care provider didn't have animals because their, you know, their children were allergic. And so, people have the opportunity to ask a series of questions to make sure they were referred to a family day care, specifically, for seeing that it met the needs of their children.
9369	Alejo	Luis	9	bcyIxM2tSYs	622	632	Yes. Well first of all, I think like we mentioned earlier we're not trying to change the existing programs that are already in place for you in San Mateo Counties.
9370	Wieckowski	Bob	55	QmHhObaXRjg	795	819	then they're the ones that keep the money. And that's the original purpose of the bill, is to facilitate conservation. Finally, I recognize that cities and counties already have the authority to raise the tax. It's raised there. So we would take an amendment that would, rather than have that redundancy, that we would just simply say special districts and
9371	Bloom	Richard	2	mltOigqY7Qc	236	261	We have the opportunity here to bring in revenue above and beyond that which members of the public pay just for the license plate. There is value, at least I would think that there is value, and it could be significant value, that this brings to the business interests that will benefit from the plates, and we ought to maximize that for the state.
9372	Roth	Richard	106	Ty0_iZ3tnjo	235	247	We need to dramatically reform ADA compliance in this state with education and training and a fair opportunity, correct. And from my perspective, I think this bill is a good step in the right direction.
9373	Grove	Shannon	77	adewtR6e1X4	878	897	now we're gonna backfill it again for the '15-'16 budget, and then. My understanding from CMS is that you recently got a letter a Thursday or Friday, that they're gonna decertify more units in Sonoma. So the federal government doesn't think that Sonoma has a facility that's adequate for these people to reside in.
9374	McGuire	Mike	93	EhsW00cBA0A	421	448	So what they'll do is, they'll dam a creek. They'll allow the creek to be able to build up in these ponds. And it's become so extreme, there are times where they'll fly bulldozers in, in the dead of night to be able to clear these lands. And then what happens is during the rainy season or because these dams are shoddily built, they'll collapse. And all of that silt and nutrient load ends up in our rivers.
9375	Allen	Benjamin	70	cbnLA63gWNQ	766	788	Better signage, I know that you have signage. It's not enough. Though, I think that there's also some serious aesthetic concerns, when you're dealing with the mountain parks, and I'm torn about that. Better placement of the stop signs, more reasonable fines, greater flexibility by the hearing officers, who are oftentimes very inflexible.
9376	Grove	Shannon	77	adewtR6e1X4	841	863	To sustain a great lifestyle for the people that are in there now, and the community that's starving. I do have questions that I thought were gonna be gone over, aside from the DCs closing and things like that. The decertification of Sonoma, the four ICF units, and I don't know who's going to answer this, the State of California had to backfill the budget, because we lost significant federal funds totaling,
9377	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	Q1ptrvjk-As	129	150	Whereas many people typically and appropriately corollate some of the provisions of Title IX with gender equity in interscholastic athletics, many are unaware that Title IX forbids discrimination on the basis of sex in any federally funded education program or activity.
9378	Nazarian	Adrin	36	WcsBFY-gdrQ	2146	2173	This week is just a conclusion of the sub committees. And what moves forward after that is a frame work that is going to continue on into a conference. So, first and foremost, I'm very pleased that there's been at least enough work done to try to, in some, step, reduce the number of opposition.
9379	Roth	Richard	106	Ty0_iZ3tnjo	247	260	I want to specifically thank my cosponsors, the Consumer Attorneys of California and the California Chamber of Commerce, for working together with me diligently to try to craft a fair and adequate bill.
9380	Grove	Shannon	77	adewtR6e1X4	913	935	11 ICF units totalling $43 million. So if can you tell me if they are going to pull the funding? Are you in negotiations with them to try to keep the funding and if so how is that going? Let us know because we're a budget sub one and we're gonna have to make a decision. And we're gonna be forced I think like we were last budget cycle to backfill a failing institution that,
9381	Rodriguez	Freddie	69	3GyLoQagQk4	1404	1421	I wanna thank you for your doing it and taking out your time like that to talk to some of these individuals because they have nobody else to talk to and unfortunately that's how you meet them in these types of situations, but with that, I just had a comment, so what do you see are the biggest challenges females face to become an officer?
9382	Bonta	Rob	85	y1QKa01q6Wg	192	200	We have a quorum, we have ten. Welcome, Senator Lara, we have you up for two bills. Item number 2, SB 4 and item number 8, SB 291. Would you like to start with SB 4?
9383	Hernandez	Ed	103	218-RTK66_I	1582	1592	A tobacco free school's district policy often gives school employees the added motivation needed to cut down tobacco use, or quite all together and with that, members, I respectfully ask for an aye vote.
9384	Kim	Young	82	P8Zs2L1mwlY	1426	1445	So, if you show that you are doing your due diligence and come to us and ask for those, I think we all agree that we will be there to support that. Why do we call it public institutions? State has an obligation. To do just that, and I"m willing to work with you, but please work with us so we can help you.
9385	Garcia	Cristina	112	FmLLF1I4yf4	132	139	We've been dealing with cyberbullying, I mean with bullying for many years and this is adding one more element in there and so I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
9386	Bonilla	Susan	3	n6Y2Iw6dcYo	280	300	And we all know, I mean if it was me, I would want to take the exam right away too. Because we all know our short term memory is a little sharper than, your comprehension has to be a lot deeper to actually remember something longer. Any math test I would ever take, I would wanna take it 10 minutes after someone showed me how to do it.
9387	Roth	Richard	106	c8SqTr4brJk	522	544	You have my commitment to continue to work these information technology issues. I will commend the governor and administration. Ms. Bosler referenced it but there is a dramatic sea change change in the way the administration and the department of technology is managing IT projects, it's a very detailed protocol for government agencies to follow.
9388	Pan	Richard	96	2nTGfRwIGSk	60	93	With a five year sunset date, SB 145 would allow the state to keep $25 million in agricultural employer and farm worker contributions flowing into health care by requiring the department to annually reimburse the Robert F Kennedy farm workers medical plan up to $3 million per year for claim payments that exceed $70,000 made by the plan on behalf of any eligible employer dependent for a single episode of care. SB 145 saves the Medi-Cal funding, while still allowing 16,000 individuals including farm workers and their families access to private health insurance.
9389	Atkins	Toni	110	NYCXegx1IV4	1880	1922	And colleagues again congratulations on your elections. I know that you're here to serve and to represent the people in your districts, and you will each work hard every day in that endeavor. And I promised to support you in that endeavor. I want to say congratulations as well to my friend my colleague Assembly Member Kristin Olsen on her first session as our Republican leader. I know that you will continue to be as strong an advocate for your caucus as you already are for the people that you represent, and I look forward to working with you.
9390	Runner	Sharon	4656	MPEe2Ccro74	2010	2031	Their brains aren't formed and there's other things we've done here, just this session, that include proposing raising the limit on people who buy cigarettes to twenty-one. Well that, to me, is going to let them kill themselves, but not smoke cigarettes and buy them at 21.
9391	Atkins	Toni	110	NYCXegx1IV4	1838	1880	Colleagues again, thank you. What a great honor of continuing to serve as your speaker. It is a most humbling thing and I appreciate the trust and confidence that you're placing in me and I promised to work hard every single-day to deserve and to earn your support. I also want to say thank you to Assemblymembers Bonilla, Gray, and Santiago for your very kind words. It means the world to me. I want to say welcome to our distinguished guests and I have a long list that I'm going to introduce a little bit later, but thank you for joining us today friends, family members. for being here for this incredibly important day for so many of our Assembly members.
9392	Allen	Travis	43	x4d8DYXm7og	117	136	Thank you, Mr. Speaker. In 2013, we established a requirement for all prescribers and dispensers of controlled substances to apply to cures database by January first 2016. So they get access to  the information in the system to help reduce prescription drug abuse and diversion.
9393	Stone	Jeff	26	3ozy7hrhoXs	872	887	For new hospital constructions that we've seen in my area, Temecula Valley Hospital, Loma Linda Hospital, what is the amount of time that you're seeing with hospitals, 300 bed, 400 bed, going from the beginning to the end, going through the OSHPD process?
9394	Gipson	Mike	28	Smx7pNnpEJQ	2008	2027	Thank you, thank you very much, Senators. I really appreciate the opportunity. Without being redundant, and I think the opponent's actually made the argument why this bill is necessary. And also 1090, also one of the opponents indicated that some of the charter schools are complying with bits and pieces of it.
9395	Leno	Mark	60	bzJzCS8XdVc	54	70	Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, committee members for your comments. I just want to challenge Assemblyman Gallagher's frame of this. If the bill were as interesting as the Assemblyman has defined the word, I doubt that I would authoring this bill.
9396	Alejo	Luis	9	r8pfLxI6EBY	544	553	Thank you very much for the entire panel for coming here. This hearing was to hear you, but they want to see how the state do better job in supporting East Porterville.
9397	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	lr5iK8Kvlcs	154	166	For me, someone that kind of went through the drug area when we had crack cocaine and we just lost our mind and we started locking everybody up like mad, mostly African Americans.
9398	Hernandez	Ed	103	GNC2APr9uoc	2339	2404	Thank you. Comments. I am going to make a couple. I may derive a couple questions from it. First of all, I appreciate the fact that you are looking at addressing the process it is for individuals to become Medi-Cal providers, but I would like to first start to talk about  the entire Medi-Cal system as a whole because I believe that when you have a lengthy process, number one, it discourages anybody, whether it's a lab, durable medical goods, providers, dentist, physicians, hospitals, etc. That and also with poor Medi-Cal reimbursement rates is another huge disincentive. Yes, I know that under the Department of Managed Healthcare, where we have Medi-Cal managed care we meet the minimum according to the state, but if you look at one-third of the population of the state of California is now on Medi-Cal, I think we need to do everything we possibly can to make sure that we get as many providers to take that segment of the population, which is a very vulnerable and very important segment of the population.
9399	Pan	Richard	96	vuTgADMvFlA	729	739	What is the value of the different things we're doing and the impact they have? So I hope that it's not just like, well, okay, here's an opportunity to save money, we're going to put some more money in the general fund.
9400	McCarty	Kevin	22	JMTzvTMjSZE	173	186	How would that work? I mean, let's say, is there a district that wanted to expand by 7% or some really high number? What are some of the highs you see as far as the possibility of growth?
9401	Galgiani	Cathleen	95	gAWN8j6c6Vc	390	408	Your point is well taken, and we agree with you. When this first came to our attention, we did continue work that was actually started by our local supervisor. And we were able to get a five year permit so that we wouldn't have to go back every year. And that would help the problem somewhat.
9402	Jones	Brian	42	75GgF4MuVHk	1602	1623	Thank you. Senator Block, thanks for working with the committee and for working on the amendments, I appreciate that. As you my know, my wife's family leans very heavily toward the naturopathic choice for medical care. And so, I'll be supporting the bill today and look forward to working with you in the future on other issues with it. Thank you.
9403	Lopez	Patty	89	NRrL3g0f7-g	145	158	past that eligible founding programs in studying to show that students whose parents participates in those programs provide academic benefit. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and ask you for your aye vote.
9404	Dahle	Brian	47	FapiTOGMI3c	981	1004	I'm gonna give you an example. In Lassen County where I was a supervisor for 16 years, it's very difficult even for the county to use gravel. We used to have a lot of dirt roads. And we only resurface those roads sometimes every 20 years. And now we have reduced our gravel pits because it is expensive.
9405	Olsen	Kristin	15	G4RiUnTMom4	881	899	The Stull Act was passed in 1971 to provide school districts with a timeline for teacher evaluations and to designate the importance of peer review and student academic performance in these evaluations. However, the act lacks definition and guidelines, and school districts have largely ignored its provisions.
9406	Allen	Benjamin	70	7zfeQPMxSJ4	171	187	So it's clearly going forward given California's long term water challenges, the State will need to access deeper aquifers and adopt and develop the technology necessary to utilize water, that we might not consider feasible today.
9407	Steinorth	Marc	35	37JGlYuk31E	46	65	I believe that when we look at the right of education and how that impacts the children, and then we take the impact of what's going on with what we had, the situation in Disney Land does that really rise to the level that we've talked about today as far as a compelling reason to be able to strip away the parental rights to be able to force the immunizations.
9408	Dahle	Brian	47	taVqkacMZr4	18	30	So the impact on, so can somebody answer to me, what, how is the mitigation for this water in the Delta, where is that water gonna come from? From the North, if the, if it doesn't take care of the Delta flows?
9409	Stone	Mark	20	iF8zLPAheNg	148	185	This is a compromise that has been agreed to by labor, by a lot of the employers, like growers, car dealers, truck drivers, who do hire employees on a piece rate basis. The administration was very very much about trying to solve this problem. If we do not pass this bill today and this issue languages without a solution then there will be lots of employers who will be subject to these statutory damages, will not be able to continue in business, will cost jobs of a lot of our farm workers, a lot of people who rely on piece-rate work to be able to survive, to be able to feed their families.
9410	Burke	Autumn	6	ASNmI2rHU9I	592	611	However, what I am concerned about on this bill is that, although I support, as well, transparency, and I'm always a huge proponent for transparency, I am concerned that this transparency isn't getting us where we really need to go, which is in finding a solution to the pricing issue.
9411	Maienschein	Brian	84	nJnCDFBqZA4	252	272	Well I think what's important to keep in mind Mr. Gallagher is this-- This bill doesn't add any new powers to probate conservatorship. It's just it begins the process. So it's one person, a judge, who's in the position who's viewing this case in its widest form to make a recommendation.
9412	Cannella	Anthony	61	icpOpHkAqBE	24	47	Thank you Mr. Chairman, members. I'm here to present SB 284 which will remove, in its original form, remove the sunset date by Senator Alex Padilla allowing engineers and land surveyors to continue to form limited liability partnerships. 3.4 million California small businesses account for 99% of the state's employers and employ 52% of the workforce.
9413	Nielsen	Jim	68	qM5DAHMb8ig	150	165	So, I'm always looking for targets of opportunity to raise issues. I don't see any necessarily here today, but I will period, I keep periodically reserve the right to say, hey. We should not approve this claim, we should send a message that we need to fight a little harder.
9414	Hancock	Loni	98	VV_hLy-Z-e8	100	121	 Thank you very much, Mr. Chair, and members of the committee. SB371 is really clean-up legislation to clarify that school and community college district have options for developing local tax measures that allow them to exempt certain classes of property owners.
9415	Thurmond	Tony	4	rOcxPrNyERc	757	779	Expansion doesn't always have to be a bad thing. When there's rationale to support that expansion, then you should do it. This bill benefits families. This bill will benefit the employers who are willing to have employees who know that their employer cares enough about them to support them and to ensure that there's a job waiting for them when they come back.
9416	McCarty	Kevin	22	GcMV__uVRbo	1408	1427	Yeah. In the governor's budget that was put forward in January, he said all these monies, the 119 is based upon no fee increase and no increase out of states enrollees, correct?
9417	Nazarian	Adrin	36	gmyBR_4Q_cg	673	687	This bill does not mandate across the board testing. AB 521 simply requires the test to be offered. And requires the patient to consent to the testing. If the patient does not consent, then no testing will be administered.
9418	Stone	Mark	20	4Kyw8qlYrTk	0	21	Is an informational hearing on worker's rights and religious employees after the Hosanna-Tabor decision was issued. I appreciate everyone for coming here. This is an important issue that really looks at the constitutional protections of the church against actions by the government.
9419	Hill	Jerry	66	WjLgtrwiclw	1328	1351	And your information is, you keep confidential as to the effort that comes from that. Yours are, you're for-profit companies, you charge people to be on the rolls to get the notifications, which is fair game and certainly part of it. But our obligation is to the citizens of California and want to make sure that those who can't afford it,
9420	Hernandez	Roger	37	dGzAwlRr2xI	54	64	Quorum is established. At this time, the first order of business and agenda here is to adopt the rules of the Committee. Does anyone have any objection to the rules?
9421	Roth	Richard	106	0HDXR-Yl1D8	1334	1357	Claims for actual injures and junctive relief are excluded from this moratorium. And finally for any business that goes to the expense of hiring a certified access specialist, and securing an inspection, by the way, a process which I've been told can cost $2,000 to $5,000. The bill gives that business 90 days from the date of the inspection,
9422	McGuire	Mike	93	8s6GBqKeNwE	884	906	It's very focused. But I think it is gonna be important to be able to focus on the issues related to public noticing, as well as the CEQA language. You know that unable to come to a final determination on that today, but allowed to get worked out as it moves forward. Again, Mr. Chair, I just wanna say thank you for all your work on this.
9423	Holden	Chris	78	-R4HGT4UbOs	2026	2045	In 1930, he and his mother were refugees from the Armenian genocide. At the age of 10, his family moved to Pasadena. Jerry played for Pasadena high school, my Alma mater, and Pasadena City College where he earned a scholarship to Fresno state.
9424	Moorlach	John	4657	vuTgADMvFlA	1361	1378	You charge all your time for going to grocery store. You were getting your own stuff, and oh, by the way, I was getting food for my client. What benefits have you derived from the implementation of anti fraud activities?
9425	Gatto	Mike	46	uuwAxYppIw8	2280	2291	We, we've been clear about that point all along. we recognize the tension between chiefs and labor and rank and file. And we're gonna do everything we can to strike the right balance moving forward. Madam secretary, please call the absent members.
9426	Gomez	Jimmy	80	0KJVRFCFgZY	435	463	Thank you so much. Any other questions or comments from the committee members? Seeing none Mr. Alejo I like the opposition's attempt to have a concern about development projects maybe five years from now during an economic downturn and how that's gonna impact the general fund, but we don't look at fiscal analysis that way.
9427	Hueso	Ben	48	Idhs0np0fh0	1629	1651	Thank you, that's perfect. Thank you very much, appreciate that. Just simply, my comments on this bill, I think this is a great bill looking out for not only our ratepayers but jobs in California. I just want to ask the author, we did propose some amendments and I just want to make sure you're okay with the amendments?
9428	Weber	Shirley	44	ZcJSZ4qEe4Y	1875	1888	Yeah, there, there are a lot of people in the field. And like I said, we did a lot of it in San Diego because we did have such an overidentification that we had to bring in some, some individuals who really were trained in this area who, some were psychologists, some were just our counselors.
9429	Stone	Mark	20	2cybSlRCgP0	1101	1110	But the fact that the closures is happened and the fact that how they happened is as critical and that's what we need to be very, very mindful of.
9430	Weber	Shirley	44	U9EPCHTiWm8	1623	1638	AP classes and on and on where the efforts are made to discourage them from participating and we see the end results in them not being admitted into our universities, not having the right requirements, and all those kinds of things. So it's a tremendous challenge.
9431	Glazer	Steve	10481	bWj7FpZXUfY	1717	1745	And therefore, that's a place that can then go through the notification system, so that a victim has an opportunity to seek restitution. That's all I'm saying. It seems like that's a clearer track to me than to somebody out there who may be having a conversation with someone on a book deal or a movie deal, that somehow they would know all of our laws and obligations that would come of that outside of the tax laws. It just seems like that's maybe not as effective. I 'm trying to find a way that would be more effective.
9432	De Leon	Kevin	102	BHYxE3t9U1s	1245	1271	Couple questions. One is, help us perhaps, understand the structure of the ALRB given that the board, as well as the general counsel are independent of each other. And it's a sort of a unique hybrid structure that is not quite common, you know, either in state agencies, public agencies, or even in the private-sector, obviously.
9433	Chavez	Rocky	83	5fJ7Ysn9i88	984	1000	Because two years ago when the plan was to cut adult education at this Committee hearing. I was one of the guys, wait slow down, because I knowing having been elected in a local community, knew the great role that adult education provided.
9434	Nielsen	Jim	68	Pt2Dhj6vkoE	662	684	And one of the factors that we have to consider is you know in this budget there are a lot of other priorities. And the employees are deserving, but it is noteworthy that we've got a lot of many other obligations. Do we have Leg. Analysts here today, Mr. Chairman? Anybody from Leg. Analyst?
9435	Lara	Ricardo	107	4INVuEQu1gA	28	43	As you know, they have had a robust debate in policy committees, some of them in multiple policy committees. So, Sergeants, would you please call some of the absent members. Do pass bill recommendations today.
9436	Nielsen	Jim	68	omT12LxK-8I	1273	1286	This has life health and safety Implications. Some don't. This is about getting permits. But we have a government that works to the disadvantage often times of the people that we represent. Good bill.
9437	Leno	Mark	60	Pt2Dhj6vkoE	620	638	Thank you Senator, and it should not go with, I would say, we appreciate each of these bargaining units working with the administration and working with us so that we can finally attend to a situation that needed resolution and it looks like we will have it. Senator Nielsen?
9438	Pavley	Fran	104	Ab32yuFXwvM	1085	1101	We've four formal hearings, lots of letter exchanges, formal letters, lots of meetings, lots of phone calls, and the list goes on. DOGGR received 50 PYs, and 7 million in annual funding primarily for UIC, for the last five years.
9439	Mullin	Kevin	31	ch3qK2_FbyA	1623	1655	Thank you, Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones is appealing the decision of the chair at that point of order was well taken with regard to dealing with the merits of the bill. Is there a second to that motion? There is a second on the floor. Mr. Mayes, Mr. Mayes seconded the motion by Mr. Jones appealing the decision of the chair. Mr. Jones you have two minutes to present. the matter as to why you are objecting to the ruling of the chair.
9440	Wieckowski	Bob	55	xJqN87zbSDI	331	347	They're pursuing a new audit, I guess the suggestion is we have a sunset on the legislation, just so that when we get to 2020, they may not have fixed the problem, I guess is the question.
9441	Quirk	Bill	23	nhD8diu7eMA	1217	1233	Third, the bill requires the policy, before it is finalized, to be presented at a regularly scheduled meeting of the governing body, and allow for public comment. Fourth, it requires law enforcement to specify how gathered data will be protected.
9442	Weber	Shirley	44	_fRo9qb8Uik	212	229	I know there's some discussion of delaying funding until the Fall, until December, January, October, to ensure that those targets are met, that that effort and outreach is done. Because we're funding a hope of increased enrollment in the University of California.
9443	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	r1PhXBRe6ug	1376	1391	It would spur his commitment to helping empower and educate English-language learners. He went on to become the principle of Sherman elementary school in my community of Sherman Heights. In seeing a need for unified Latina voices in San Diego, he helped found the Chicano Federation in 1968 and the next year was instrumental in the creation of Chicano Park in Badiologan.
9444	Hueso	Ben	48	woVTT_HPcvA	1059	1075	There is potential that they could be run inappropriately. And we want to make sure that doesn't happen, because, we have provided too much bureaucracy for our veterans population.
9445	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	A2CxN21_Gyw	22	43	Thank you Madam Chair and committee members. And thank you for hearing my bill today. I also want to thank the committee consultant for a thorough analysis. Nobody wants to appear soft on crime, however AB 610 is a pragmatic solution for alleviating recidivism as well as preserving the fiscal integrity of the state.
9446	Stone	Jeff	26	OOj1xAhpXgw	761	780	The bill passed out a Health Business, and Professions and Appropriations committees unanimously. We've address many of the concerns raised by members and buy those in opposition. I will continue to work with those in opposition as I hope this bill moves forward.
9447	Stone	Jeff	26	OOj1xAhpXgw	725	746	informed consent, and that the company sponsoring the development of the investigational drug is willing to make it available, that does not mandate that they do, they have to voluntarily make it available to the patient, and there's no mandates on insurance companies to have to pay for it, including Medi-Cal and Medicare.
9448	Hancock	Loni	98	J0kwSkFFMEE	1269	1310	Just my observation, because I've been very concerned about the fragility of career technical education, that was just really blossoming and coming into its own as a recognized way of keeping students in school, lowering dropout rates, and preparing young people to go on to higher education, as well as job readiness. But it is a fragile, slightly different approach than the traditional reading, writing, arithmetic, academic testing model that had been prevalent in our schools for decades.
9449	Mitchell	Holly	64	gN6B3iXXHo0	859	881	We will continue to strive to find that balance. I remain concerned with the notion that including mold as a substandard living condition is unnecessary and unreasonable. Code enforcements, code enforcement officers have made it clear that current law does not provide clarity when it comes to defining mold.
9450	Cooper	Jim	21	zsI5W6gUO4I	130	145	They paid three quarters of a billion dollars. That's a lot of money in anybody's pocket. To pay that kind of money, it just doesn't pass the smell test. I've just got to tell you that. It doesn't sit well with me.
9451	Hancock	Loni	98	r722a4Ml8Ec	262	290	And I do. I'm always in awe of the balancing act that this budget is, as we try to make the choices that we have to make. Having said that, I have another issue that I would just like to put on the table at this time relating to the Prop 98 budget.
9452	Hill	Jerry	66	ckveUQ3Zvdc	552	573	If that cannot be done, the pharmacy will be required to communicate information about the dispensed product to the patient's prescriber. I'm hopeful that the debate this year is no longer about whether a seriously ill patient and their doctor should have access to information about the specific drug that was dispensed. On this, we can and must all agree.
9453	Moorlach	John	4657	m8iyuGdEmL0	1556	1570	I wanna give businesses much, you know, as much as possible to make it a more pro business state, but I also want to balance a budget and pay down debts and attack pension liabilities and build roads and take care of the homeless and the poor.
9454	McGuire	Mike	93	Laqdju9yTYg	284	293	Thank you so much chair woman. I just want to take a moment to say thank you to the chair woman for her work on this important issue and for bringing us together today. Thank you so much.
9455	Nielsen	Jim	68	0sKrxcyZVQA	456	470	Now I do understand that. But if the protocols then would dictate, that they have to find a waste facility, somewhere in another state. It's costly to transfer. It's costly to put it in. That could have some implications. Could it not, for the industry?
9456	Bates	Pat	58	fHSPrRTBHyY	1338	1370	I just wanted to make a comment Senator Hill. I'm so impressed with what you've done today. We had a situation in my community that was a near miss and it would have been almost like San Bruno. So, thank you so much for digging into it and certainly, it's a work-in-progress, we all have our concerns about the two areas: agriculture and I think the landscape maintenance.  Big issues for my communities and have a lot of each ways that have landscape maintenance folks and we don't want to slow that down.
9457	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	mNyHP9HDpqk	1452	1467	Yes Mr. Holden and Mr., Mr. Louizos. There are some concerns that, have come up in the, the, the plan's criticism, and we see that there have been many bills that have come previously before us.
9458	Cooper	Jim	21	vnNgkCps5TE	192	213	The ultimate goals for today's hearing, is to examine and discuss the use of body worn cameras by law enforcement, including the capturing, downloading, viewing, length of retention and storage of video footage, the best case scenario for what body cameras can do to improve relations between law enforcement and the community.
9459	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	3bQ_hUBlpio	1585	1617	It is man who has separated us by race, religion, gender and geography. So, when we say black lives matter it also means all lives matter. African Americans may have started the fight to abolish slavery and segregation, for civil rights, and elimination of apartheid, but it is all of us; Latinos, Asians, API, women,
9460	Gipson	Mike	28	yegxkcxS3po	1581	1608	This audit will examine the increase in non-residents enrollment as how it is affecting our resident students access to the UC campus. The communities I represent in South Los Angeles and Southern California has some of the highest minorities in the state. I want that to sink in just for one moment.
9461	Leno	Mark	60	oXhYdSan_zc	548	572	I've an article here from Bloomberg from earlier this year. Best state for business. Yes, California, is the headline. And it points out that 63 publicly traded California companies in the standard empires 500 index produced the best total return among the five largest states.
9462	Beall	Jim	92	WqUDcmRj8Cg	6	24	Everybody turn off their cell phones if they want to bother us while we spend the next 3 to 4 minutes in this committee. And lets take our roll. We have 4 measures, all on consent items.  And all the items on our agenda are on consent. So we'll take the roll and then we have a motion on the consent calendar.
9463	Weber	Shirley	44	BMNgYibzIuk	1234	1253	And LA has a program. So rather than reinvent the wheel, rather than send our Department of Education folks off to figure out how to do this. We felt there's a program in LA Unified School District that has been doing this for a number of years is at a point of the research stage to figure out what are the strategies? How effective is the program?
9464	Wieckowski	Bob	55	jna-qIkO0Wg	1563	1580	So what's a whipped problem? Because I think there's a lot of push back. The state developed a policy, set up a fee of $150 to have residents pay for management of the forest fires.
9465	Monning	Bill	25	I17DTXkdVm0	1695	1712	This bill mandates the application of healthcare standards by the judiciary when authorizing psychotropic drugs to children in foster care. No psychotropic drugs would be authorized without prior medical exams of the children and ongoing monitoring must occur.
9466	Block	Marty	59	XCJDmlcJFbk	219	225	We don't yet have a quorum if you're willing to hear this hearing as a subcommittee we will proceed with the hearing and move to a vote once we have a quorum.
9467	Huff	Bob	105	A1UTGLmNv2E	2195	2214	Annie's son, Fred Aguire, served six years with distinction in the state Assembly, serving among other things Chair of the Assembly Rules Committee and Speaker Pro Tem. He was later appointed Cabinet Secretary under former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.
9468	Rendon	Anthony	120	pqf8UezhQwo	2131	2153	We don't seek to, we all know that the goal of RPS is not to sort of privilege any technology over any other, and I think that was the reason for having such a narrow sort of definition in this bill, to make sure that it was only public agencies, and it related to waste water, but I certainly do understand your your comments. Thank you.
9469	Maienschein	Brian	84	QmHhObaXRjg	2086	2107	You're exactly right that it's still the city's on the hook for these requirements without having the funding source to do it. I think what's particularly troubling is in essence the secrecy or the uncertainty that doesn't allow for good budgeting at a local level. So, pleased to support your bill thank you for bringing it.
9470	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	Uu6l955bq80	332	347	Along with Linda Derrick, did I pronounce that right? She's with  the association american university women branch and they are going to talk with us about future actions and solution.
9471	Leno	Mark	60	Skk_s7qoQEk	153	164	can serve to provide more comprehensive service to people in California who are in need. So, I would ask for your Aye vote on the amended bill before you.
9472	Garcia	Cristina	112	xxo2ATBDxJE	682	696	AB 832 creates clear, consistent, and non-discriminatory standards for my native reporter. This bill does not change the law of statutory rape, nor child abuse, such cases would still be reported. The mandated reporters would still be required to distinguish that the acts are voluntary.
9473	Hancock	Loni	98	PR6Aqie0NK4	1351	1378	You'd go into a kind of low-income household and you'd say, "Hi, you know, I'm running with the clean money system and I'd really like your support, and here's what I stand for, and could you give me $5," and they'd say, "Well, it's a little reach, but yeah." And he said, "it was interesting because they'd ending up saying, 'And grandma (grandma's watching TV). Come here, grandma. You could give $5, too.'"
9474	Weber	Shirley	44	toyLEHK5bMU	1951	1969	to the matter. Since I've been here I've heard nothing but discussion of redevelopment, redevelopment, redevelopment with no solution to anything. And every great idea has tremendous opposition to it without any solution as to how you address the problem itself. And it seems as if after all of that time we're
9475	Wilk	Scott	19	qzvpjn8Cr2Y	125	142	So I just wanted to follow up on your earlier testimony. You were citing I think maybe a study in Arizona where they tried to expand primary care access through broadening the scope of nurse practitioners and you said it failed. I was just wondering if you could elaborate more on that.
9476	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	7LRhPIA-4tY	240	268	on how to move people up the ladder or bring people in. We had somebody earlier talk about bilingual. I love the Fresno idea, going to the churches? But that's not in any civil service book, okay? And, so you're not gonna find it here. And then, lastly, it is the individual who is in charge of the recruiting. It's individuals in charge of the hiring.
9477	Chang	Ling Ling	18	HccZsvAseDo	1724	1742	Tangerines are extremely symbolic in Asian cultures the round shape of tangerine signifies family unity and it's golden color represents wealth. So, on your desks tangerine. Children and unmarried adults are also given red envelopes containing money for good luck
9478	Pan	Richard	96	EvD39W6YJ0A	1381	1395	Just to clarify, what we're doing in this bill is saying for the twelve weeks after the first 6 to 8 weeks you get access to differential pay and you don't have to use sick, well you probably used up.
9479	Allen	Benjamin	70	iTrvWXqiedk	2136	2157	Alright, thank you Senator. I wanted to ask the folks from MRCA, it seems to me, you know, that I've driven in mountains a lot. The best way to slow people down is through speed bumps. And, I just wanted to know, what, whether you've, you know, to the extent to which you've considered speed bumps as a traffic calming mechanism?
9480	Wagner	Donald	88	g465sM88Jms	429	442	Okay. Without a vote. It does not require them if they exerc, no county need do this, Sacramento not, does not need to do this. If it chooses to do this, does the bill say you can do this only with a vote of the people?
9481	Holden	Chris	78	keBQI17Ppm8	1584	1602	Well thank you, I appreciate the comments. We recognize that we're going to continue to work with TechNet and many in the larger community to try to identify ways of identifying grants that would be outside the general fund that we can propose
9482	Ting	Philip	30	0xUa-SoTZfU	385	400	So, I guess, how would you, I guess address that? Because you, again, there's no one forcing the students to go, there's no one forcing the teachers to go. There's no one forcing this on you. You could choose to go down to the public school or work at the public school down the street if you so chose.
9483	Hernandez	Ed	103	V40hlwpKzww	107	125	This bill, SB 323, is a simple and modest policy that is long overdue in California. This bill does three things. It establishes a uniform scope of practice for nurse practitioners that is widely agreed to be the services that they already perform today.
9484	Gallagher	James	108	FA0o_dng1YE	1982	2001	We don't know that DAPA and DACA are going to be found to be constitutional or adjoined. Saying up a new program is going to have funding. I know you're saying if it's available. But, you know, whether or not that funding is actually going to be available is a question and we'd be creating a new program that's going to cost money going into the future, so.
9485	Hernandez	Roger	37	HZaArTsCL5U	1696	1713	Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members. It is my pleasure to welcome a delegation from Dell Records to the floor today. Dell Records is based in Assembly Member Garcia's Assembly District in the City of Downing, but they're sound is heard throughout Southern California and Mexico.
9486	Cannella	Anthony	61	5WD5y8t5m5U	856	866	Since I've been on the audit committee, I've supported almost every single audit because I think we have an excellent state auditor. And I think it's great for us to shine a light on whatever we want to shine a light on.
9487	Brown	Cheryl	13	NNzDQCiG5UU	973	997	In 1967, Mr. Kimber became the first African-American criminal investigator for Fresno county's public defenders office. Kimber and his wife Paline, founded and published that newspaper, the California Advocate. He garnered numerous awards including a 1975 American Civil Liberties Union Award in Northern California.
9488	Hernandez	Roger	37	HZaArTsCL5U	1731	1741	In addition, the family of the late Ariel Camacho is joining us including his father Benito, his mother Renalda, and his sisters Kenya and Cynthia. Members, please join me in welcoming the Dell Records delegation to the Assembly floor.
9489	Stone	Jeff	26	Ga_QNYq_wVM	1941	1956	I mean, these are very serious, very serious issues that you've identified. And I must say that while my very good friend Senator Anderson, are good friends today, we were rivals about four years ago.
9490	Block	Marty	59	t4hQNDqgAZU	75	110	So let's focus, like a laser, as my colleagues have done, on just the education issue, we're the education committee. And we have here clearly a rights in conflict, we've got the rights of parents who wanna be able to send their children to schools they perceive as safe, and to them, safe means having nearly 100% vaccinated children, those parents have a right to send their kids to schools they perceive as safe. On the other hand, the parents, many of them here, who don't want to vaccinate their children, have a right not to vaccinate, so what do you do?
9491	Chavez	Rocky	83	bencsnxh2-c	960	981	I would I don't have as big of a problem with taking the general fund as others do, but, cuz I thing we ought to take care of these people. Because, it's a bad situation. But I think, institutionally, we've gotta take on the position of taking on these, these, for-profits that are taking advantage of our veterans.
9492	Atkins	Toni	110	Y0xkoNoudD0	901	919	There are 77 co-authors, 78 co-authors are added. Our final roll call is on the bill. We can take a voice vote on this item. All those in favor say aye, all those opposed nay, the aye's have it. The resolution is adopted.
9493	Beall	Jim	92	U-gbn_qz8sg	175	194	It seems logical to the average person that if we reduce demand that we would have a larger number of days of reserve in gasoline which would help save the taxpayer money in terms of gas price.
9494	Beall	Jim	92	pjSDFWGC8xY	1446	1465	And we're gonna focus on solving the problem, let's just get down to it and let's figure it out, and let's solve the problems. So I think that's what we're trying to do here, we're trying to focus, solve the problems. It's not gonna happen all of a sudden.
9495	Mullin	Kevin	31	oObwrA_56LI	1071	1090	File item nine: pass and retain. We will now move to announcements and adjournements in memory. Request to adjourn in memory. The following members were granted prior permission to speak on an adjournment in memory. Mr. Bloom, you are recognized at your desk for your adjournment in memory.
9496	Monning	Bill	25	I17DTXkdVm0	1551	1579	SB 561 will address this problem by eliminating the requirement for an HIS to register to work for each contractor individually and instead will streamline the IHS registration process by requiring contractors to notify the contractors' state licensing board when a registered HIS is working for them, allowing the HIS to work for multiple contractors once the appropriate notification has been given.
9497	Stone	Jeff	26	yLe3bHZ0qDA	380	401	Thank you Madam Chair. I just want to ensure that we're not providing duplicate services here. I know that the Senate recently passed a billion one relief program that included services and goods for migrant farm workers.
9498	Atkins	Toni	110	41sY1zeIoSY	334	356	Additionally the killing of Africans, Africa's elephants for ivory is a primary source of funding for rebel groups that are killing people and destabilizing the entire region. These are groups that are notorious for committing human rights violations, including murder, mutilation, rape ,widespread abductions of children, and adults sexual, slavery, and large-scale massacres
9499	Wood	Jim	72	qMylnhtxSF8	401	424	Is, there will be another outbreak. We did, I believe we did an incredible job from a public health community around the measles outbreak. It was a public health effort, that helped to stem the spread of measles. It was diligence in a lot of communities. And when you look at where this disease started, and where it spread to, it's pretty amazing, how quickly it got to lots of different places.
9500	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	-eBMHFfPn-c	1003	1025	Last question, Mr. Vashir. Do biologics and biosimilars, if that's the correct term in this bill, provide the potential for reduction in the medication that someone with chronic illness would have to, a reduction in the medical regimen, and the pill regimen, that someone would have to take who has a chronic disease?
9501	Beall	Jim	92	rSN8XCdpbf8	1407	1418	The other brother was caught in this trap and he ended up homeless. And so, because he was in the juvenile justice system, he ended up to be a homeless because they took away his foster care benefits while he was in the juvenile justice system.
9502	Gaines	Ted	24	Q1vYBQdDLNc	1611	1627	We did learn a lot about hydro power, the ability to work with a tribe in British Columbia on a joint effort for renewable energy that also preserves the ability of salmon to spawn.
9503	Leno	Mark	60	jsGbKJLFERc	355	380	There are clearly many challenges in these big projects and I've heard a lot of different suggestions as to how we can best deal with them. One presentation I heard from one of the disruptors in the Bay area is that there's a lot of talent out there and that we don't need to hire theses big, call them, dinosaur folks to come in.
9504	Mitchell	Holly	64	L-zMn7PZXCE	1031	1051	Got it. My assumption was you wanted the performance measures in this one year contract, but it would be planning for the rest of the relationship, whatever that looks like. Do you have questions of the L.A. County person before we move on? Ok. Thank you. Next witness.
9505	Pavley	Fran	104	tX-iRiZ5OnY	1319	1346	I'm in favor of raising money for road maintenance, that's not the issue at all. Should it be fuels, all the fuels, 2 million plus a year? Whatever it is. Billion going into just road maintenance and those purposes. I would say that would not be a priority expenditure of GHGs and meeting the test of the legal nexus when AB 32 and the scoping plan was envisioned.
9506	Nguyen	Janet	65	LW2wm2tITKQ	1112	1126	Not only that, but it's also the safety of the individuals, the patients inside the hospital and the employees as well. Should we just look at something much more comprehensive coming forward or?
9507	McGuire	Mike	93	ZWBFpMLdAlA	198	217	And it's because a lot Californians can't qualify for those programs. And the community services block grant program can help alleviate poverty for some people who otherwise don't qualify for state and federal aid including single adults. And as we see an unprecedented widening, a gulf if you will,
9508	Hill	Jerry	66	ChbIO5XT7O8	1700	1721	The bill also requires the Department of food and agriculture to develop antibiotic stewardship guidelines to help train veterinarians and producers on how to use antibiotics effectively. Lastly, the bill requires the department to develop a system to participate in existing systems to better track antibiotic use and resistant pathogens on farms.
9509	Hill	Jerry	66	upsj9UOakDk	1262	1283	Very good, thank you. Miss Wallace, I'm going to ask you the question that I asked earlier, and that was the issues that have been raised by the California Association of Dental Assisting Teachers, California Dental Association, Dental Assistants Association, the Foundation of Allied Dental Education, and you indicated in your previous answer that you have been working with them to address the issues.
9510	Pavley	Fran	104	aMmnutMx8lk	693	705	Yeah, it's a study of a bill that's had a lot of interest, I'll put it, in this part of the state. Let's hear briefly from your two major witnesses.
9511	De Leon	Kevin	102	YuFgB6EIE5U	1259	1274	And that's why we need to figure out where we can find the money. You said one key thing which was the executive branch, and not to mean this branch, but previous executive branches because of neglect, irresponsibility, because we ended up with the three-judge panel and receivership.
9512	Chiu	David	7	ASNmI2rHU9I	844	854	And we know through the Wall Street Journal that Pharmasset was gonna sell Sovaldi for $36,000 per treatment cycle. Imagine the impact of the discount if it was marketed and sold at that price.
9513	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	MO4QFekCxFk	363	376	And, and not having the kind of physical activity they need. And having fast food restaurants on every corner that are cheaper than, than healthy food. That there's a problem. I love all the programs that would be funded through this.
9514	Rendon	Anthony	120	vyfz8Yq8ZGw	646	661	Thank you, sir. Anyone else in opposition to the bill? Are there any tweeners on this bill? Great. Let's do questions from committee members. Mr. Quirk, and Ms. Garcia.
9515	Daly	Tom	118	bn5R6N5l4NI	526	544	And again, I don't want to be splitting hairs too much. But normally when cities support something that they want the state government to do, there's a means, they send a letter and says, you know, on behalf of the city of Oceanside, we have voted, we have, this is our position.
9516	Stone	Mark	20	Iv2-QZj_dZk	320	345	We wanna make sure that those incentives are there so that business aren't making a business decision about when to address the Ada issues, but are making sure that they're addressing those issues upfront. Senator Roth's bill is now in the Assembly, it provides for much of those steps dealing with casps and insuring that the right incentives are put in the right place.
9517	Thurmond	Tony	4	maPB0VHfdFQ	2297	2310	Phillip was a sherrif with the Sacramento sheriff's department. Phillip lived and worked in Sacramento he mentored kids in Glen Elders the south Sacremento neighborhood where he grew up. He was a member of the full gospel business men's fellowship
9518	Gaines	Ted	24	SK-C_51Liio	459	479	And a lot of demand to live in a beautiful city. And so is government providing a sort of relief to try to provide affordable housing? Whether it's rental or owned. And whatever that priority may be for the community. Is that being addressed?
9519	Perea	Henry	33	ZI4xP65SSCE	1619	1637	Right. Absolutely, I mean this is, I think we need to look at this, you know, in two ways. One is certainly savings for business, for small business, so we can do the things that you mentioned, continue to hire more workers, but this is also about injured workers and making sure that they get the right care that they need to get back to work.
9520	Fuller	Jean	49	FHGwb8kBog8	698	716	There's identified flow of what has to happen. Step one: you try to keep it, like, under ten steps. And, then you give that as a protocol to the bidders and you don't let the bidders bully you as Mitchell has said.
9521	Fuller	Jean	49	oDMixRIfl_Y	1104	1120	So I'm forced to ask it in this interview which is embarrassing me because we all have a lot of times taking up, but there we go. If we had been able to clear it with a letter back in June. I wouldn't have to be doing this.
9522	Moorlach	John	4657	PdAu9Oh2C5Q	1150	1166	Well, two thoughts. The first is, we're relying on forecasts, so I understand that game. But if we're gonna underestimate expenses and overestimate revenues, then that creates a real awkward situation if both come to fruition.
9523	Lara	Ricardo	107	Vek2DamGMzQ	1371	1384	Thank you. I appreciate your comment. There's no clapping in committee. There's no clapping in committee. I appreciate you sticking to the fiscal components. We're going to allow for one more testimony. Go ahead.
9524	Monning	Bill	25	YaTK7ym74zw	95	110	Furthermore, COHS plans are the recipients of state funds to administer managed care exclusively to that population and as such, we should make sure that these taxpayer funds are used wisely, and the care provided is adequate.
9525	Stone	Jeff	26	uk0vIxtVZmg	14	25	I mentioned earlier today that, you know, we'd like to see bills 72 hours in print, and as my colleagues have mentioned, we got this 72 minutes before our caucus even had a chance to get together.
9526	Monning	Bill	25	YaTK7ym74zw	56	76	Amendments taken in the Assembly Health Committee delay the bills implementation to give COHS plans ample time to comply with licensure. As the analysis points out, the licensing fees and the administrative costs for the COHS plans are fully reimbursable and more than half of these costs will be reimbursed by the Federal Government.
9527	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	WsNNww2cgqU	979	998	Consequently, currently judges are required to administer an advisement regarding possible deportation, or exclusion from admission to United States for the conviction of an offense. This bill only adds to the advisement and will inform defendants of the collateral consequences of accepting a plea and becoming a felon.
9528	Frazier	Jim	114	mxsKkg9J8wc	1046	1065	Thank you, sir. Mr. Chair and committee members, thank you for the opportunity to present AB 345. Current law requires a real estate broker to exercise reasonable supervision over the activities of his or her salespersons. AB 345 would earmark three hours of real estate broker's existing continuing education for
9529	Gatto	Mike	46	Ve6b2OIjftM	1596	1612	It's going to affect the pot holes and the tree trimming and the development of a city. It's hard for that person to break through to get the mail out to get people interested and to get them to pay attention. So I guess the question is how do we balance this I mean how do we balance this?
9530	Hertzberg	Robert	99	LuelkxPlWfo	1420	1431	This is a much larger subject and certainly a whole larger discussion with shared economy raises these very important issues, particularly communities like yours where you're so desirable. But specifically it's not intended to, to deal with that.
9531	Nielsen	Jim	68	CKcxsxPbopg	520	550	What are you talking about? Tell me what you're doing better. Now this is not an argument of guilt by Association. Farar has been a part of that for a very long-time. If you look at the administrative numbers in the budget of CSU and UC how that has grown. Folks, that's not helping our youth.
9532	Perea	Henry	33	RtQ8dRQaXv0	422	437	So I would just I would ask that you keep them back your mind and if someone goes a little too long I may ask you to wrap it up I'm not trying to rush you out but, we do have a lot of bills to hear today, and we do have a lot of people that are here for this bill in particular.
9533	Mitchell	Holly	64	nY2lpyYF7UA	1	13	Thank you very much to the witness. There's a large group that's joined us in he balcony. Are you the group from Cathedral City? Okay, wonderful. So Senator Stone, you want to welcome them and I'm glad you're here to witness your government at work. Senator Stone?
9534	Williams	Das	12	AY2GGpXPzCw	36	54	 Thank you Mr. Frazier. The Chair's recommendation is aye. There's a motion and a second. Anybody want to say anything? Seeing none. Oh. We did not say, other witnesses in support? And we will take witnesses in opposition if there is any.
9535	Weber	Shirley	44	nugSHhjUz14	163	189	Two, it is talked about we said as a priority to reinvest in schools and early education. This version of the budget increases Prop 98 funding for 2015-16 by $8.2 billion more than was provided in the 2014-15 budget. The assembly version also, of the budget, provides $600 million in early education and child development investments above what was proposed in the Governor's May Revision.
9536	Hertzberg	Robert	99	miQ0Fm1d12I	479	499	But isn't streamlining the process Will you include the considerations of the city? I mean, one of the great challenges we face in urban areas is that there's a disconnect between these separate silos of education and, and city planning. And what you're trying to do here is, in fact, really streamline it, where you're taking in the interests to combine them and look at it holistically.
9537	Leno	Mark	60	Ea-UVDMoM1k	1042	1068	Senator Mitchell, all great questions and concerns, and my own perspective on the special session with regard to health care is that I am entirely optimistic. And that because of public interest, public scrutiny, and public pressure, this legislature will find the political will to do what it needs to do.
9538	Mendoza	Tony	52	iSM5Bpt31OQ	800	812	Placement referral agencies provide a great service to our aging population, as they provide seniors and their family with resources and assistance in finding suitable, long-term care, or, an aging facility.
9539	Stone	Mark	20	cyEYl7uOG5U	41	50	Thank you. And the latest set of amendments are being handed around, I believe, ok, that we came to agreement on so the ones we worked on last night.
9540	Leno	Mark	60	Y13vuRnCz5Y	832	845	That didn't stick with me too well. But I did want to ask the authors if you could respond. to the same presenters question with regard to, it was mentioned by someone in public comment as well, but that physicians will have to live when they sign the death certificate.
9541	Cannella	Anthony	61	9celf0om_Bo	50	84	You know, the 5% call, whatever it was 5 or 7 percent that was it, if it even was that. Nobody could get through and I have seen a significant turn around. We get hardly any calls related to EDD, and I think it's largely because of the leadership that you provided this organization since you've been there. Also, the economy is getting a little better and hopefully there are not as many people unemployed, but we still have a lot of people in California that are in need.  Again, I appreciate all your hard work that you've done with that department.
9542	Leno	Mark	60	Y13vuRnCz5Y	818	832	From some of the presentations I did have a few thoughts with regard to concerns for oncologist or any other physician that this-is permissive no one is going to be forced to do anything.
9543	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	DPeb4bLxnpo	1745	1772	Are sucking up lots of water and then turning around and selling it to desperate and, and needy areas for huge profits. So they are excuse me, looking at the water crisis as a profit opportunity and I'm wondering what steps you are taking or are considering taking so that they're not able to benefit
9544	Chiu	David	7	mOH5gnV89FM	6	21	The clerk will close the roll, tally the votes. Ayes 41 no's 26. Measure passes. We're going to pass temporarily file item 41 and go to file item 42 AB 1328. The clerk will read.
9545	Wieckowski	Bob	55	YaTK7ym74zw	2002	2019	I'll have defense bar comment. We will note that we amended this bill to make it a five year bill, to come back to see how it works because everybody has such a great interest in it, but Mr. Belote.
9546	Hall	Isadore	1	kj6ztr1oPBg	291	305	may be subject, may subject the tenant to legal action including possible eviction. SB 761 will also require potential hosts to acknowledge this disclosure prior to listing the short term rental online.
9547	Frazier	Jim	114	Paz6OIae0eQ	701	715	Seeing none, Mr. Kelly, thank you so much for coming forward today and presenting, and I look forward to you on collaboration working through the economic and also the environmental aspects of the movement of goods and services.
9548	Fuller	Jean	49	pnu4iUzw8JA	952	963	So please consider those thoughts on the one hand. The other worry that I have is a larger worry and it's... I'll try to make it short. I appreciate the Chair's patience.
9549	Hernandez	Ed	103	OACKM5KF8Sk	1345	1365	Thank you very helpful again. And just one final question and I'll apologize in advance it's a little self-serving but  what would be the anticipated impact of Assembly Bill 366, which I happen to author, which raises Medi-Cal reimbursement rates and as well as Senate Bill 342, which my esteemed colleague in the Senate ...
9550	Allen	Benjamin	70	wXHA3EWrHe8	253	271	Absolutely. So, here we are at the education committee. I came to this experience in the Senate as a former School Board member. I served on the School Board in my hometown and we had relatively low vaccination rates and parents were coming to me, coming to members of the board and saying what are you doing to protect our kids in our community?
9551	Nielsen	Jim	68	kap3kcxQfYA	1820	1837	We need to examine those not raise taxes ways to accomplish it and I would argue that there are plenty of funding around to do that. But this is an infrastructure that far too long, been neglected.
9552	Campos	Nora	76	1KjWKKHWibE	967	1001	The case in Ferguson where law enforcement deployed armored military vehicles to respond to civil unrest over the police killing of a teenager, Michael Brown. These are just two cases, and so I decided that we needed to address this. AB 36 would establish a public process that would allow for communities to get involved before dangerous free military
9553	Hertzberg	Robert	99	UpjsW9YiW28	268	284	But then say, you gotta make a showing that you couldn't get this anyplace else. Because that's really what's going on. Any manufacturer that's doing this is an honorable cause. So maybe you say, okay, if the number's 10%, but in order to be that low, you've gotta make a showing that if someone comes after you, that you didn't.
9554	McGuire	Mike	93	GnxGwd8ZNfU	291	324	But, as you will hear today, many of those pieces are coming together very slowly. This is all the while California's poverty rate has continued to rise and the gap has widened. It has been and as you'll hear today a major undertaking to incorporate all the changes in the new program. It's clear the outcomes of our states neediest residents continue to suffer and taxpayers will pay more in the long-run if these system changes aren't implemented at a faster clip.
9555	Perea	Henry	33	RfCRfIjvcog	1384	1394	The difference is that we're targeting a different group of people. So you gotta sorta get over that. I know that I had a hard time trying to get over that.
9556	Baker	Catharine	74	Gf9OHu0urRM	345	374	At the same time resident students, it's been 3%. And that's a disparity that every California taxpayer is concerned about system wide, that triple digit difference between cumulative non-resident and resident students. So it draws me back to a question that I want to ask first is where is your proof, or ability to back up the idea that resident students are not being displaced?
9557	Chiu	David	7	Vrc3ih-DRQU	251	282	Seeing and hearing no further debate, the clerk will open the role. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote. All members vote who desire to vote.
9558	Beall	Jim	92	8ENPCPUYlKU	406	432	Under motions or resolutions Madame President, I request unanimous consent to submit a letter to the journal regarding this bill, SB 326, indicating commitment to work on a plan next year to determine other funding sources for air ambulances. This has been approved by both sides of the aisle, I request unanimous consent of entering this letter into the journal.
9559	De Leon	Kevin	102	hRtfvXDpHuA	2	26	Thank you very much, Madam Chair, as well as colleagues and we'll make this very quick. I know we have senators up, Mark Leno, as well as Ben Allen here today also as well. Madam Chair, as well as members, I'm pleased to present SB 548 the raising care -- Raising Childcare Quality and Accessibility Act.
9560	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	vEySB-JPx9Q	1622	1642	And so, if we want to reduce if we want to reduce the costs associated with education, where we are remediating and remediating and remediating, the opportunity exists now to provide that kind of support, that kind of education, so they all start at the same starting line.
9561	Thurmond	Tony	4	54O2UbeLCuE	1236	1248	Professional development, we know, is one of the best ways for our students to be supported in their academic achievement. To me, this is akin to saying, you start a new job and then we tell you, you have to have training and you have to pay for your own training.
9562	Campos	Nora	76	Zewkjo1Xkzc	54	84	Existing law does not effectively protect victims and their surviving loved ones, from the commercial exploitation of violent crimes for entertainment purposes. My bill will maintain the current ten year statute of limitations, that was one of the things that you asked. But will require that the victim, or their next of kin, be notified when a contractual agreement is made for the sell of the story of the crime committed.
9563	Hertzberg	Robert	99	_QWOBYYvqfo	1180	1189	Volts, and they pushed them for the California market. When you look at the electric vehicle market with Prius's sold and what all these companies are selling, they're all testing in California's market.
9564	Gatto	Mike	46	CD2KiD3xDgY	117	125	Thank you very much. I just want to point out that these, these students that we're trying to to affect here, are really the students that are in the most need.
9565	Leno	Mark	60	gWhhKfvsU08	259	277	Since then, we have seen double digit growth in the billions of dollars to raise that minimum guarantee. But at the same time, we haven't seen anything comparable in regard to restoration to childcare.
9566	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	8w4HbL8_L_s	177	200	I'm kinda curious. As this warning system is developed, I know I work with a lot of emergency management organizations, police, fire, and they have their own internal incident command system, but even that may be dated, I don't know what it's called now, but that was in 94, maybe called something different now.
9567	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	8w4HbL8_L_s	200	218	But, then they have to be activated, and so how were you envisioning this early warning system coordinating with police, fire, and others so that they can then become activated, so that we're all moving and syncing as one to get things done.
9568	De Leon	Kevin	102	fjQhThyumBs	625	639	Obviously the criteria pollutants that are emitted are very harmful to your constituents as well as to others. So, I was glad that I was educated and then I think we came to, I think to an elegant conclusion with regards to short haul.
9569	Cooper	Jim	21	CGzgwiFisVc	125	142	So I just have my concerns, will you be fully staffed and funded at an appropriate level? And it hasn't happened in the past, I'm not sure it will happen in the future.
9570	Leno	Mark	60	8epuGfrU4TQ	222	238	About 400. And so in your construction of this, and I'm not arguing in any way against it, but in your construction of it, the idea is that the 400 would be an incentive for more work.
9571	Melendez	Melissa	41	7f5uDPxTBXo	1520	1541	My disagreement comes in that the rules aren't the same for filing for gun violence restraining order and finding a domestic violence restraining order.  I think we've already shown that and I think when you look at, we're talking about the potential for someone to do harm to another.
9572	Cooper	Jim	21	VjN2j4PuSG8	601	617	We just passed a toothless bill. I'm here, I came here to be a voice of people and I may not agree all the time with everybody, but really it has no substance in the bill that was just passed and what my issue is, nicotine's addictive, with that. So we all know that.
9573	Leno	Mark	60	EvXJx3b_7-s	1193	1211	Okay so the vote is on the UC funding package as Mr. Golaszewski had presented to us with the cap on the three campuses for specifically one year. All right. So that is the vote. 3-0. 3-0.
9574	Hertzberg	Robert	99	GL6n7Ol5uP8	128	152	that might have a longer term life than what the life of the contract is. So at the end of the day, this is a de minimis increase where there's clearly a customer demand. And the bottom line is, getting to your point about cost shifts, it's a theoretical argument if we're wrong. If there is no demand, if those 685 customers that were in line and others that have talked about it say we don't want it.
9575	McCarty	Kevin	22	ZXZJp00flVo	480	494	And this will allow us to add the 10,000 students to make sure we focus on serving the needs of all Californians wishing to go to the CSU system, and focus on helping improve graduation efforts of the system. Is there a motion on the CSU package?
9576	Leno	Mark	60	iVjsAvWHgB0	1370	1385	And I don't think, and this is probably getting back to Assemblywoman Melendez's support earlier, that those savings shouldn't be dissolved into our general fund. They're for a purpose. And they're for the purpose of this community.
9577	McGuire	Mike	93	qTf-RqJKEFo	1292	1311	the California border in Oregon, on the North Fork of the Smith. This strip mine, Madam Chair, would be one of the largest on the west coast and would devastate the Smith River watershed, including one of the largest Salmon and Steelhead runs in the contiguous west coast states.
9578	Weber	Shirley	44	hTPaXL_VY8w	707	735	Medina? Baker? No. Baker no. Bloom? Chavez? Aye. Chavez aye. Harper? No. Harper no, Irwin? Aye. Irwin aye. Jones-Sawyer? Aye. Jones-Sawyer aye. Levine? Aye. Levine aye. Linder? Linder not voting. Low? Santiago? Weber? Aye. Weber aye. Williams? Aye. Williams aye.
9579	Hertzberg	Robert	99	WJQRNP9q0xQ	1734	1743	File item number five, Senator Hancock, SB 371 due passed to the floor, motioned by Senator Pavley, Chair voted aye, currently three to one. Secretary call the absent members.
9580	Rendon	Anthony	120	DgVvXUz7n-U	647	675	These Californians do not have another legislative session to wait for us on this floor to act. They have entrusted us and so we should act to provide them all with options. This bill does not interfere with faith, this bill is about choice. That is why, I urge you today to support the End of Life Option Act, to allow mentally competent, terminally ill adults the option to choose to die with dignity, and pain free. I ask your aye vote.
9581	Kim	Young	82	9-tqw489jZ4	374	400	proposed projects. My colleague has raised all the concerns that I was going to a point out but the amendments that was taken on May 28 still is a concern to me. For those reasons I just cannot see myself supporting it. For the record I would like to oppose this bill and I hope some of the members will follow suit. Thank you.
9582	Hertzberg	Robert	99	wxAms1gWFJA	596	613	 Thank you. Any further support? Any opposition? Any body who's just lukewarm other than that student housing guys? Questions for the members. Yes please, Senator Moorlach. Does it work?
9583	Irwin	Jacqui	16	oIrgXGq-Z_I	83	97	This exemption is needed because currently the risk of legal action associated with this transfer of information has discouraged the private sector, particularly small businesses, with smaller security budgets, from engaging or investing in these security practices.
9584	Irwin	Jacqui	16	oIrgXGq-Z_I	97	128	Simply put, this bill incentivizes the use of the best tool companies have to defend themselves, sharing threat information with industry partners, which enables corrective or defensive actions before a vulnerability is exploited. This practice of information sharing is widely recognized as a best practice for combating cyber security threats. The National Governor's Association, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and our state Cyber Security Task Force are amongst the many groups that promote this practice.
9585	Frazier	Jim	114	OGSzGIXfLs8	1065	1083	With me today in support is Chuck Helgate, representing the California Association of Veteran Service Officer Associations. Mr. Chair, I would also like to extend my sincere gratitude to your committee staff for their hard work and dedication to making this the best bill possible. Thank you, and I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
9586	O'Donnell	Patrick	113	8bOmzPkZfE0	1815	1826	Down the road there may be some reason to change the board but today I can't be supportive of that just so you know where I'm coming from. With that, any other comments from the committee?
9587	Hernandez	Ed	103	7rpHMWXYPjE	244	258	Thank you very much, Mr. Chair and members. I appreciate the committee's work on this bill. I'm happy to accept the amendments as recommended in the analysis. This bill would allow for a limited pilot program for what is known as truck platooning. I believe this bill is similar to the one
9588	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	nkFf3IHgULc	1028	1038	Thank you. Very briefly I think we're probably pretty well versed in the issue, and understand what you're promoting here. So go ahead, very briefly if you would sir.
9589	Leno	Mark	60	alaNgMhEeC8	283	297	And at the time this most recent minimum wage increase went into effect, California's unemployment rate was 7.4 percent; today it's 6.5 percent and dropping even in recent months.
9590	Holden	Chris	78	3bQ_hUBlpio	348	361	Thank you Mr. Speaker. I request unanimous consent to suspend assembly rule 118 to allow Assembly members Brown, Gonzalez, Jones-Sawyer, Low, and Steinorth to have guests and photographers on the floor today.
9591	Nielsen	Jim	68	zPn0btnMxJg	496	510	Our third panel now. The challenges of outreach. We have Sean Stephens, Marin County, Hannah Williams of Butte County, Virginia Wimmer of San Joaquin County, and George Dixon of Monterey.
9592	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	bP5invw1wi4	31	48	The pipeline was being inspected every two or three years. If the pipeline had been inspected more frequently, the spill could have been avoided, or would have been avoided, because we would have known that the pipeline was corroding rapidly. Indeed, it was so rapid that it was extraordinary.
9593	Brown	Cheryl	13	0LdXFnPqPCk	2284	2334	Last year, I saw him at the veterans program over at Cal State University. He was indeed proud of the award that he was getting that day and he was very proud that finally that we as the community and as America were recognizing those soldiers that came back and didn't get the recognition that they deserved. I'm proud to stand here on behalf of Colonel Paul Green and I ask that you close in his memory. Thank you.
9594	McGuire	Mike	93	Pvh7fZV71H4	771	793	So the way it works, okay 50%, 52% in annual credits to commercial and general aviation airports every aviation airports, 27% to create an air service to citizens program, 15% for acquisition and development grants as well as for the state airport improvement, with the remaining 1% in aviation education program just because there are so few pilots, but feel free to go ahead and chime in.
9595	Chavez	Rocky	83	NNzDQCiG5UU	755	775	I count him as a friend. I've been over to his office a number times. I'd just like to say this, some of you may not even even know it. If you actually go to his office and look on his wall, you'll see this big-picture of the Latino caucus and right to the right of it you'll see another picture of what he proudly says is the Republican Latino Caucus of Eric Linder and myself.
9596	McGuire	Mike	93	GnxGwd8ZNfU	1748	1765	Michelle, you did a fantastic job. It's just pretty amazing what you faced, and now where you're at. We're grateful that you are here sharing your experience and cannot thank you enough for taking the time.
9597	Allen	Benjamin	70	3ZbkIQK-LEk	1658	1684	You know is the cost and potential environmental impact of removing them outweigh the impact of letting these reefs remain there. And I want to get a better sense of the objection, of the sort of the environmental, of your environmental weighing I suppose. Because I understand that it's, you know a changed environment.
9598	Wood	Jim	72	UUDrPWxX9_Y	754	793	In Solano County 4,859 plants were seized valued at $14.5 million. The per plant value based on these stories would be between $2,500 and $4,000 a pound which may be high. And no pun intended there but that. Huffington Post had an article late last year highlighting the findings from ArcView group. ArcView is a national investor network that provides financing to marijuana based ventures that said that the legal marijuana industry in California is valued at 1.3 billion dollars with a b. And the national legal cannabis industry, valued at $2.7 billion.
9599	Bonta	Rob	85	YFmVbaB_4iY	105	119	We're at capacity and we don't want to have any problems with the fire marshal. So in order to make sure that everyone has a chance to be heard, we need to follow those rules. I want to thank in advance everyone for being here today. I know a lot of you have traveled a long way, which I appreciate.
9600	Bonta	Rob	85	S7bS9hRXdl0	318	332	Additional witnesses in support? Seeing none. Witnesses in opposition? Seeing none. Questions from Committee members? Seeing none. We have a motion. We have a second. Would you like to close, Assemblymember Wood? Oh, Assemblymember Nazarian has a question?
9601	Nielsen	Jim	68	_fRo9qb8Uik	1659	1669	But in both cases I think it's incumbent on us to ensure that we accomplish, in this budget, at least a two year freeze on tuition at both levels.
9602	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	Fotikfq9Ybo	1457	1467	I mean is that part of the discussion or is it straight; we're the thinkers and that's what we're going to do? We're the innovators we're going to innovate.
9603	Gomez	Jimmy	80	UUDrPWxX9_Y	73	96	I've worked closely with the assessors, who have removed their opposition to the bill, to include strict conditions and meant to narrow the application of the bill. Ultimately AB 668 will assist hard working low income families afford their mortgage payments, increase access to affordable housing, and create opportunities for home ownership in California. I have a few witnesses to speak on behalf of the bill.
9604	Hill	Jerry	66	UpjsW9YiW28	2110	2122	if you've one person in the building, that person will be dead, and if it's especially at the rate of 10%, which I just learned that 10% per minute of survival rate is diminished.
9605	Stone	Jeff	26	kcJR3FqGhiM	208	231	So I look forward to participating in programs that will accomplish these goals so that we can combat poverty here in the State of California and I believe that there's a will and I believe there's leadership and I believe there's dedicated advocates of eliminating poverty in the state which is demonstrative by all the wonderful people that are here today. I welcome you being here and look forward to your testimony.
9606	Cannella	Anthony	61	KHtTIUat0hU	1922	1931	I think what we've shown in California over the last several years... that the nay sayers will say we can't do anything. We set the bar high and they figure out a way to hit those targets.
9607	Garcia	Eduardo	38	EtJ6XaeStes	926	939	This bill is building on a bill that was authored last year by Assembly Member Team. And the bill strives to require an electronic submission of graduation verification data.
9608	Stone	Mark	20	4Kyw8qlYrTk	124	138	It makes sense for us to explore the issue in greater depth, and I look forward to working with my colleagues and all stakeholders on possible solutions. That is a statement by Assembly Member David Chiu, who's also a member of this Committee, the Judiciary Committee.
9609	Moorlach	John	4657	7wM-SWUAGJQ	347	370	Thank you, Madame President. I've been really struggling with this bill. And it just seems to me with AB 109 and Proposition 47, so much has been happening with the release of inmates into the counties and cities that I'd like a little more time to elapse before I'm comfortable in taking on this bill
9610	Beall	Jim	92	LW2wm2tITKQ	239	265	Yeah I just, as a representative of the Midpeninsula Open Space District, I'd like to congratulate them for the fine service of preserving 62,000 acres of open space in our community. And specifically the board chairman Mr. Siemens for his service. I'd like to point out to the committee some facts.
9611	Pan	Richard	96	Ln1AhL9Lp3Y	1945	1970	also unfortunately has, at least over time, and also the proponents have also testified the historical roots of some of that, may not have been how again, in debate about how that came to be attached to your particular school or the other schools that are in the state. But I think also, unfortunately, also carries many other connotations as well.
9612	Pan	Richard	96	9PxlbB74Usg	861	873	And even if, quote "someone else has to be doing it" someone  wasn't actually, someone didn't care enough to say well we actually care about the results and realize that they didn't have any results to follow-up with.
9613	Monning	Bill	25	9wfdC9HGDSQ	2451	2470	Yes, purposes of announcement. Members, there will be a members-only reception to give our best wishes to consul general Carlos Gonzales immediately upon adjournment in room 317, members-only. All members are encouraged to drop by. Thank you.
9614	Thurmond	Tony	4	GY0D4Q5rw0s	1606	1620	but we would like to have ongoing conversation between this Subcommittee and certainly with your policy Committee on those topics. And you are always welcome here to come and discuss that topic or any other one here in this Subcommittee.
9615	Hertzberg	Robert	99	Wq4BKtQGDbc	228	242	Now, there's a second part of the trade. One is a systemic part and one is our own mistakes about whether of not people either educated to vote, want to vote, think what all rat thinks and don't want to vote for us. But this is an urgency.
9616	Hill	Jerry	66	9xlCmdTyLME	101	116	That's very good and I appreciate that. I think that you raise a very good point because this is just one part of the overall problem of antibiotic resistance in California and in the country. So I think we need to look at every aspect. Thank you, Senator.
9617	Leno	Mark	60	4mB1nCFXohc	6	18	We want to spend it as wisely as possible and reduce the most greenhouse gas emissions that we possibly can, and to benefit as broad a part of the state as possible.
9618	Pavley	Fran	104	FapiTOGMI3c	19	39	I'd like to start by accepting the technical amendments from the committee and thanking the staff of this committee, Mr. Jarrett, hello, for your work on this bill. This has been interesting. This isn't an area that you would normally associate me with, but I chair the Natural Resources and Water Committee.
9619	Allen	Benjamin	70	4mB1nCFXohc	314	356	I think that they really have the potential to be marquee projects that could help lead the way for the rest of the state, indeed the rest of the nation. So there's a lot of interest there. So I really wanna make sure that, that gets included in the final project. The other thing is, I just wanted to strenuously agree with Senator Beall, and his comments on transit, and I think when you look at the combination of positive impact that can come from transit investment from job creation to quality of life, greenhouse gas emission reduction, addressing the housing crisis that we have in our big cities, and sustainable growth, I just, I think he's spot on and I would really like to see us up the transit portion of this expenditure plan.
9620	Mitchell	Holly	64	k4GcCA0Jbo4	1176	1188	The SBC details what is covered under a health plan, explains coverage limitations, and provides definitions of key terms to consumers to help them evaluate and compare their insurance their health insurance options.
9621	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	yhx1NvxzAgA	3	33	A number of bills today, but I'm going to let you know what bills have been pulled and what bills are on consent. So if you're here on those bills, you can either consider your day done or stay for the fun. We have the following bill that has been pulled from today's agenda, which is file item 11 AB 998 by Assemblymember Wagner.
9622	Mitchell	Holly	64	zKRXexcG8LM	1554	1572	The US Department of Justice decision follows hard on the heels of a Washington post investigation called Stop and Seize that found that since 2011, police have made cash seizures worth more than 2.5 billion from motorists and others without first obtaining search warrants or indictments.
9623	Leno	Mark	60	rn8iMdWxrk0	1662	1681	And I just want to clarify that this bill will not require any employer to hire any applicant for employment that he or she does not want. This bill will not require an employer to provide any benefit of any sort that he or she does not want.
9624	Mitchell	Holly	64	c8SqTr4brJk	307	323	And so you know part of it is on us quite frankly. And what we tend to do in budget committees is have a knee-jerk reaction and not give them the resources they need and then if they come back in a year and they failed again then we're holding them accountable where as we have to figure out how to be partners to make it successful.
9625	Quirk	Bill	23	KMXnTjJiK-4	252	277	Thank you Vice Chair and again attorney Ricketts and Mastagni you have brought up some excellent points. I'm really glad that you've testified today. Attorney President Thoma, California Attorneys for Criminal Justice who do in fact defend the people that are accused of crime throughout the state.
9626	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	FVQ4YG_BqFE	1235	1255	I don't believe that the WSPA is speaking on behalf of OSPR. There is a reason we don't have them, and there are other tools in the tool box. They've never been used. They've never been needed. We believe that it would be appropriate that we end even the consideration of something that has demonstrated itself to be a real negative.
9627	Alejo	Luis	9	XSL2yLxKUCc	1495	1508	That's why we addressed a lot of the abuses and concerns that from previous redevelopment, we addressed those, and again, it's trying to help those communities that have high crime, high poverty, and high unemployment.
9628	Hadley	David	40	Zpd1xPV5yGk	70	96	Thank you Mr. Chairman. The Senator, thank you for the bill. I think your witness had the crucial point about this bill in one of his phrases. High Speed Rail will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, if it is successful. There is almost no likelihood that the High-Speed Rail project will be successful in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
9629	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	g595lZYQYE0	1549	1561	No, no guidelines on what type of artificial turf, the color the purpose, but, as you can see, and that's one of the reasons I brought samples. I, it, the aesthetics have developed.
9630	De Leon	Kevin	102	8E9La7s73fc	1247	1263	So, I think the exportation of renewables is critical for economic growth as well, too. So, with that, I'd like to entertain a motion.  Okay. It was done simultaneously, this was a tri-motion.
9631	Monning	Bill	25	cXnV6IOLWSg	35	57	The chair will mention, will announce, that room number but promptly back at one for the Transportation Committee. BMP to follow, if the file is ready, also in Room 3191. Members our plan is to reconvene on the floor at 1:30 sharp we will be returning to Extraordinary Session 2we need you to be here promptly at 1:30 so we can conduct business.
9632	De Leon	Kevin	102	8UaA3ArF3qo	53	66	of the bill of references to policy Committee. So we're going to go again. First, the reference of bill to committees minus SB seventy five through one oh nine. So were splitting the question there.
9633	Gallagher	James	108	B4ry1_3tU0U	860	876	Yeah, you know as I was stating earlier, I think the current status of our immigration policy creates an environment where undocumented persons are being taken advantage of. And this is another, another area where that's occurring.
9634	Pan	Richard	96	m65WWf8IMs4	124	134	I think it's probably also more difficult administratively to say, how would you do this? Would you say okay, in this school district we're going to impose this but not in that school district?
9635	Chiu	David	7	yD31wFlBzTc	1622	1629	Okay and I know that there's a working group that's looking at some of these high priced drugs. Could you give us a little update on the activities of that working group?
9636	Hertzberg	Robert	99	phnFAAdDWJg	185	208	If we're not, we're in trouble. And so I just think the question really you want to think about is, what can the state do intelligently that can create that framework. Whether it's further perfecting the JPA law, whether it's integrating for purposes of the bond lawyers to finance some of the other things that currently aren't financeable, because we can securitize them over a long period of time and make them financeable, like, you know, a bunch of creative ways to do it.
9637	Medina	Jose	81	RsqrHgBrOM8	2148	2174	I'm pleased to present AB753 which is a measure that will encourage non-certificated educational employees serving in positions requiring certification will become permanent employees following a probationary period. Under current law certificated employees in non-teaching positions at county offices of education with an average daily attendance
9638	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	Wq4BKtQGDbc	36	51	So that's just some thing to for members of the committee to be aware of that the postal service has changed rather significantly and it's anticipated that it will continue to evolve less congress invest significantly in it.
9639	Baker	Catharine	74	9fvwP7KwrvY	1437	1470	The answer is yes. That I did wanna clarify that one because it was cited as an example for the need for this bill. In addition, I'm also trying to understand if there was some way, basically this. As a consumer of nurse practitioners when I call the pediatric practice for my kids or my own doctors, part of the reason that works is, I know there is a doctor behind that NP.
9640	Chau	Ed	116	gT2_z9UGrSs	708	726	It is a voluntary, totally voluntary basis. So if a school district, for example, is interested in this matching grant. Then you know, all, all they need to do is to earmark certain dollar you know, dollar for dollar to the fund which is set up for the trust fund.
9641	Roth	Richard	106	6KgzpeS3bCM	1414	1436	I'm just trying to get some clarity here. If this bill prohibits hospitals from causing patient etcetera-etcetera to be transported to another location except when the patient is medically stabilized, how does the bill hurt? How does it cause harm to the hospitals?
9642	Beall	Jim	92	898OiW72jWg	728	763	We require the budget process to compile and develop a process to evaluate both private sector and public sector cost and the cost of delivery. Cuz I think one of the issues, I'll just say this, is you shouldn't just look at the cost of an engineer. You should look at the cost of how quickly you can build and develop the project and the total cost of engineering, construction.
9643	Wood	Jim	72	24W2oeMkjbI	289	300	No. They'll, they'll still comply with the Dep, Department of Public Health Regulations, but, but they won't go through the licensure procedure, which is duplicative and redundant quite frankly.
9644	Monning	Bill	25	yX08DTKKVc8	1564	1585	the concern about safety of officers' safety of other inmates that's paramount. And what I hear from the author is an absolute commitment to find that balance that doesn't sacrifice protection for what I think is an absolutely necessary conversation and needed reform.
9645	Wilk	Scott	19	TmtzANXYgv0	655	672	Well, actually the point I was going to bring up is what the author just did, the manufacturers have gone from doing, issuing these technical notices to safety recalls. I don't know about you, but every car I've got has improved in reliability over the years. So, here's what I'd walk away with on this bill.
9646	Hernandez	Ed	103	tIl0bzr-tVs	1759	1779	As you know, we have a shortage of doctors here in California. Study after study highlights this fact. Including one released just months by the Association of American Medical College that says, demand for physician continue to grow faster than supply leading to a projected shortfall of over 90,000 physicians by 2025.
9647	Hall	Isadore	1	zxPLA2x-8Hc	1359	1381	in bringing this compact to where it is today. I know that you all are very busy negotiating multiple compact agreements, and so this is one off the docket that you should be proud of. And to, obviously, Mr. Gribbon, thank you for your hard work in making sure that your employees are well represented of course.
9648	Wolk	Lois	94	CsEqtnrRs7I	1362	1384	2-0. Now, funding the Beverage Container Recycling Program. Alright, Director Mortensen, you begin. And, this is an informational item there's no action being proposed, but very brief overview of this and comment would be helpful, so we know what's in front of us.
9649	Alejo	Luis	9	GYqLytCM9KA	794	822	Thank you Mr Chairman and members. I also rise to speak in support of this bill AB 1361 which will make changes to the first entry program of judgment pre-trial diversion from to limit potentially harsh and unknown immigration consequences for minor and non-violent criminal offenses. This is also one of our Latino Immigrant Priority bills because it aims to address discrepancies that is proportionally impact our immigrant communities. In our state, more than half of the children live in a house where at least one-parent is an immigrant. This is vitally important to preserve our family structure.
9650	Liu	Carol	63	Ln1AhL9Lp3Y	1643	1660	Assemblymember Alejo, it's just, for full disclosure, Assemblymember Goldberg and I had a set to, in 2002 regarding her bill because she identified Redskins, Indians, Braves, Chiefs, Apaches, etc.
9651	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	WDMO-JAPunI	543	568	I just want to say that that's the part that's really distressing, is that court reporters have to be objective. They're the ones that are taking down the transcripts, providing the information on appeal when Testimony needs to be reread. It has to be done impartially, and when you have a firm that tells your they're committed to helping you win your case.
9652	Cooley	Ken	45	kLTY4thtXsA	781	791	And I think that's a key issue to, for all members to focus on. So, I just thank you for the opportunity, I do know it's going to suspense. Thank you for the opportunity to present today.
9653	Bigelow	Frank	91	xuTeMXcZRA0	1069	1081	Wow. Man, I was holding my breath on that one. I was getting nervous. Any questions from the members? Seeing no questions. This bill is out on an A.
9654	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	-v-krVjWW-I	2114	2130	They can only do that through their city council members. Our city council is split on this. Our mayor obviously is opposed, but I'd ask that this body not only do this for public policy reasons. But I think clearly, for the legal reasons that have been outlined by the legislative councils. Well, I respectfully ask for everyone else's an aye vote.
9655	Cooper	Jim	21	IxMULKwgq0k	1638	1650	So with drones, for the media I would think ahead of time, we would have to have them obtain permission. Versus the Principal telling him after the fact, okay your drone is flying overhead, get it off our property.
9656	Hueso	Ben	48	Rj2lrXkjDIw	1587	1613	When you-- I'd like to ask you to respond to that in terms of-- from the perspective of the duck chart that we've been learning a lot about as legislators where we have an overabundance of intermittent power that we flooded California market with that has created a concern that in those periods where have high peaks of production and renewables,
9657	Gaines	Ted	24	IxMULKwgq0k	1650	1662	Okay, thank you for the question. It does require the news media to stop the use of a drone over a school grounds upon request of a school Principal.
9658	Hueso	Ben	48	Rj2lrXkjDIw	1613	1626	we're pretty much offloading or unloading a lot of power in the state at a great cost to ratepayers. This bill would exacerbate that duck chart, it would make it more acute.
9659	Monning	Bill	25	msMPqU5kPd8	699	719	Thank you again, Mr. Chair. So, keying off a question, I would just add that part of the public health strategy, with vaccination. The public health protection is based on a high percentage of the population being vaccinated.
9660	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	nrJtkVtsuec	1226	1242	Thank you. As Chair of the Select Committee on Passenger Rail, and I know that Senator Beall is a Vice Chair of that and working hard on the whole issue of rail. It's my hope that this measure continues to build momentum.
9661	Hernandez	Ed	103	6KgzpeS3bCM	748	758	You know, this bills been scaled back significantly even with some of the concerns that we've had or I've had and, you know, with regard to some of the triggers from Covered California at CalPERS request by the purchaser.
9662	Hueso	Ben	48	u9WQRBoV7yg	1829	1850	Thank you Mr President. As Vice Chair of the Latino caucus and also as the Chairman of the Select Committee on Bi-national affairs with Mexico, I rise today to adjourn in the memory of Ariel Camacho. He was the lead singer of the popular norteno group, Los Plebes del Rancho.
9663	McCarty	Kevin	22	CEtC6uXpjsc	369	393	So if you look over a 10 year period, the increase for financial aid went from about $300 million to north of $800 million. And so, the actual money that the California State wrote to UC in 2007 was $3.6, and 2014, $3.8 billion.
9664	Dababneh	Matthew	50	WbiiRILqv6s	1153	1175	I'll start off by thanking my colleague and chairman of this committee for holding this. This is actually very informative and I have learned quite a bit more about what our constituents and many of the consumers of the products that have been at risk lately are feeling about these issues. As chair of the Bank and Finance Committee, I look forward to working with this committee closely to make sure that we're looking at financial institutions.
9665	Bloom	Richard	2	9fvwP7KwrvY	604	631	Well, so these oversight boards go about their business obviously in different ways, but I guess I'm still up in the air as to whether or not one is less effective than the other. I understand the makeup is different, but at the end of the day we should be looking at outcomes and how we're achieving outcomes.
9666	Hernandez	Ed	103	6KgzpeS3bCM	733	741	I still believe that the market needs to play its natural course out and if we're really going to have the conversation and rate raise then we need to bring everybody in.
9667	Chiu	David	7	wIEWRsTF1no	959	979	Okay, great. Thank you. Let me ask at this time, unless there are any other comments from the panel, if there are members of the public that wish to speak to these issues. If you could please step up to the microphone. And ask each member of the public to limit your comments to one minute. First speaker please.
9668	Hill	Jerry	66	EhsW00cBA0A	2040	2047	The bill has six votes. It should get out with that but we'll hold the role open for absent members. Thank you Senator Mcguire. Appreciate it very much for your presentation.
9669	Wieckowski	Bob	55	9Kkq97ccCr8	1142	1161	Right, right. But I'm just saying, is at the end of the day, if I'm making $70,000 I do get a garnishment. It's not 10% under the original bill. It's 21.4% But I want to address your concern that if that's the sweet spot that the, I'm hearing from the committee that I need to make the adjustment on it, then I will.
9670	Weber	Shirley	44	4l8d3tner_c	1202	1218	What can you do to make those individuals that come onto the program more successful, and exiting the program in a very positive direction. As opposed to into a child-only case, where they're not moving off of the program. So, there was a lot of work done after.
9671	Wieckowski	Bob	55	WSuppHjpCKY	1977	1993	The situation is that you can go through divorce and you can give your wife the boat that happens to have $25,000 worth of equity and then you claim the 704 exemptions and she doesn't, and you don't have to file the waiver.
9672	Bates	Pat	58	ZhE_hzRecAQ	1830	1848	So I oppose this approach to getting more people involved in the democratic process. We certainly need some interim steps and then by virtue of interests and excitement in participating, we will get more people out to vote.
9673	Hancock	Loni	98	JI861kYqkEk	50	73	These folks are team. They're doing the intense work of implementation which, as we know, is where all good ideas go astray. If you're going to go astray and if they work they become models for the nation. Thank you so much for being here. Director Tidwell, why don't you lead off?
9674	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	JT1Tm7zEIWc	312	331	And everybody was following the rules, but they were changed retroactively. Well isn't that exactly the same thing that is happening to these attorneys? So I just think, we have to be fair to everybody. I concur that there shouldn't be this penalty
9675	Hertzberg	Robert	99	CY8dWb1-gXw	1150	1164	She does have a five-year sunset. Does it work or doesn't it? The fact of the matter is there are California companies where the dollars are being invested in California. I'm sure if you brought in the Department of Finance even if they're failed entities, they still have significant economic feedback effects cuz they're hiring Californians.
9676	Perea	Henry	33	xJqN87zbSDI	1695	1707	And I get that based on the district that I represent and that others like me represent, we provide a unique and a different perspective that sometimes is heard and sometimes isn't.
9677	Hertzberg	Robert	99	_NTagRCFfsc	477	493	And the government has other responsibilities or other services that they provide. If this in fact increases the delivery of food, if it help, if it has impacts on health costs. All sorts of stuff, and do you have any studies on that or other jurisdictions, that can help us understand it.
9678	Lara	Ricardo	107	4INVuEQu1gA	268	286	As you know, I offer SB 447 to correct some of the ambiguity in the laws pertaining to mine operators. And I want to make sure that the conversations that are being had doesn't undermine the work that we've done for my bill last year so. I'll support it today. I just wanna make sure I'm kept in the loop.
9679	Wood	Jim	72	8sqAOKYjfF4	939	976	AB-1231 ensures that low income beneficiaries, especially in rural areas, have access to transportation for their specialty care needs. The bill requires that non-medical transportation be provided to specialty care beneficiaries if those services are more than 60 minutes or 30 miles from the beneficiary's place of residence. I do accept the amendments, the bill will be subject to utilization controls similar to MediCal coverage for transportation. And the department, but there is a requirement at the department to implement legislation through an all county letter. Here in support is Linda Neely from the Western Center on Law and Poverty.
9680	Garcia	Cristina	112	etnGLuiVGv4	1437	1455	Thank you Mr. Speaker and members. Senate bill 150 will assist former students that are currently in college by exempting them from state income tax on forgiven student loans. On May 4th, a college declared bankruptcy and sold all 107 of its former campuses nationwide. It's really impacting more than 13,000 California students.
9681	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	qjDm_sZ-lfo	1737	1758	may not have independent value, we're creating loopholes for the consultants and notarios that can look at that, and create justification for anything they do. But we did add things that have independent value, including post-conviction relief, which is a huge issue under this bill and everything else, we know regular deportation and the ability to stay in the United States.
9682	Chavez	Rocky	83	MO4QFekCxFk	1266	1279	My point is there's a lot of things we can invest to change the environment, so children have other choices. Taxing this industry on this, it just makes you feel good, you go back and tell people I did something.
9683	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	5jUUOwMdhxk	892	908	I think that I've shown by my example last year with sick days, we continue to work with the Chamber on trying to clean up language on that. We continue to work with employers, both large and small. That is the hope that our office has as this moves forward.
9684	Chiu	David	7	-C1RVRucLcc	1481	1497	Sovaldi, and if it's actually a 46% drop, while the power of a hearing, or the power of hearings, to have an impact, but at the end of the day, we should have enough transparency to have a fair conversation so we're not going through this exercise every single time.
9685	Bloom	Richard	2	4tou47dRNaA	674	691	December 31st 2010, thus ensuring that the project were being actively pursued by their local agencies. Since the Governors veto of this re-development bill last year, my office and sponsors have been working with the Department of Finance and the Governor's
9686	Beall	Jim	92	pJxZbc1RoIw	1451	1467	They say if we pass this measure it probably will be maybe eight, 10 years depending on the conditions in the future of catch up time. They'll have to catch up over eight to 10 years. That's about what it'll take.
9687	De Leon	Kevin	102	TrPgAQvjTc0	1523	1547	These are policies that are real. These are policies that are tangible. These are policies that are set forth with a sense of intentionality to create an economy of tomorrow. That's just our reality. Look, at the numbers. The methodology doesn't lie.
9688	Dababneh	Matthew	50	zdfniIDuOwc	106	116	All we're saying, as we've done hundreds of other times as an institution, is that we should make good policy that effects the whole state. That is for all of us to live under and live by.
9689	Stone	Mark	20	_0FvACJKmKc	1140	1153	And if you're asking me to make sure that in the amendments that we're moving forwards, that we address that, that we take the chamber and see Jack and the grocers up on that discussion, at your request I am happy to do that.
9690	Galgiani	Cathleen	95	UqQcd0TyhPE	1072	1083	So it wasn't just about our pets that we think of, but these were livestock animals that all of a sudden we were challenged with how to address saving them.
9691	Beall	Jim	92	1JV-wI6cFUY	1999	2012	That's what's going to happen. We're going to end up bankrupting the state government, having these people circulate in and out and all through these crisis hospitals, prisons, you know, but, not actually dealing with the issues.
9692	Nielsen	Jim	68	SwF1WjZp4L4	885	900	Last question then. When you're business planning, and you don't have to recite them here, I could just get a get them on paper or something, but do you have then an anticipated ridership and annual revenue?
9693	Beall	Jim	92	Rbv3X8-oLv8	1183	1227	I had a question if you had, when you looked at the amount of money that we need to adequately take care of what I call the backlog of maintenance for local governments and for the state, when you look at that, what is the proper, how many years does your plan, and what do you think is the number of years it will take to really tackle that problem and eliminate the deficit of maintenance for our local streets and our state highway systems?
9694	Gallagher	James	108	RK37B-MMwt0	513	537	AB281 would also make three additional revisions to the collateral recovery act that governs licensed repossessors. The first would amend a section of the act that was missed when AB791 by assembly member Hagman was enacted in 2013 and removed an outdated provision in law that authorized repossessors to make demands for payment in lieu of repossession.
9695	Cooper	Jim	21	elRk6CudldM	1732	1754	And I would've like to see DOI reach out earlier and work with these folks. I mean, they're willing to work, I've talked with them and like I said, these things have been going on for years and rarely do you see cases prosecuted. I mean, maybe in L.A., but, for the most part, as far as I'm concerned, as far as I'm aware, there's not a lot of prosecution. It is much needed, but I would've like to see more done in the front end initially.
9696	De Leon	Kevin	102	mgO95LX_sqE	882	902	And with the crumbling infrastructure, that has a potential to really severely truncate and stunt the continued economic growth of the region. Therefore we need these continued investments. Because with these investments we have the ability to leverage, if you will, more dollars from the private sector.
9697	Weber	Shirley	44	uuwAxYppIw8	989	1013	Because in that case, they didn't have the opportunity to even have the protection that our police officers should provide. And so those are the realities that, the, the communities in which I live and in which I've been raised. And I, and I, and I would hope that we would make every effort to restore confidence and this is just the first step as we move forward. Our, our videos on television and everything have, have given us a view into a world that exists.
9698	De Leon	Kevin	102	mgO95LX_sqE	902	917	Investing more than actually what is conceivably possible. If the voters of LA County actually give us the opportunity, and honor us with the opportunity, to move forward with the vote in 2016, and in fact with a two thirds threshold, pass it.
9699	Cooper	Jim	21	ErZVzyFotGs	681	702	Thank you. Before we continue, got members going in and out, it's a very busy day here at the capitol. I wanna welcome Dr. Webber who's the chair of our Budget committee and assemblyman Tom Lackey. You guys have any comments? Yes. Okay.
9700	Allen	Travis	43	KcpO7Oo2ci0	1498	1515	I would love to. Thank you very much. A number of things. First Assemblymember Wood and Assemblymember Burke, thank you both for your comments very much. Assemblymember Wood's specifically related to your comments. You had mentioned a small business in your district who noticed that his plan cost had risen by 30% in one year.
9701	Stone	Jeff	26	nfRac3nHOas	1068	1092	I'm absorbing a lot of what's going on here today and I could kind of speak from a county perspective where our public defender, our District Attorney, our share of our probation officers have been united in basically drinking out of a fire hose when AB 109 was implemented.
9702	Hill	Jerry	66	OcW4SGQXlmw	753	771	Why, I think that ultimately would be the general fund, but that's not part of the equation in this. But the good thing that I heard today, that I thought the director mentioned, was that those bureaus and agencies and boards are not going to be responsible for those extended costs,
9703	Ting	Philip	30	uYiCyuWd4SM	549	576	We carved out the liability protection in part to really create some greater incentive for those who aren't using the translation to use a board certified, statewide system translation so that we can have some consistency across the state. It's obviously from an individual pharmacy to pharmacy basis we thought that would be a harder issue to really crack.
9704	Bates	Pat	58	2vPXZZpEjE4	95	114	Both assembly member Bill Brough and I have attended several community forums, and we have participated in several stakeholder meetings in order to help find a solution that will allow the San Clemente Hospital emergency department to stay open as Memorial Medical Care Health System continues to explore a conversion of the facility.
9705	Grove	Shannon	77	NEf6zh-NPIY	644	653	Thank you, Mr. Chair. I just have a question. Isn't there already something in law that requires if there is a 5% of the population that speaks a specific language that documents have to be translated in that language, but not if there is like one or two?
9706	Grove	Shannon	77	ZI4xP65SSCE	1778	1796	There is a high increase in employees being addicted to opioids and it is destructive in families, and this could be stopped if this formulary is allowed to be produced in a scientific based manner that allows people to get pain medication without the addictive factor and complying with the original prescription. So thank you very much for bringing it forward.
9707	Nielsen	Jim	68	N-Bfbq4TmhI	1564	1575	In having reviewed it as thoroughly as I have, to this point, I do not consider myself an expert. I do applaud Senator Hill for taking on a very difficult issue and spending an awful lot of time.
9708	De Leon	Kevin	102	E_gAhll2czw	1026	1043	There's no doubt in my mind that people from different cultures and religions can live freely next to each other and have mutual understanding and respect. This barbaric act that took place a few days ago in Paris, France is in no way representation of the muslim faith. We need to keep our world safe from organizations that foster extreme ideology and prevent them from equipping members with the resources to carry out these kind of horrific attacks, here at home, as well as abroad.
9709	Block	Marty	59	D_2wduB3Bxk	65	94	Despite their classification, responsibilities, and the high-rate of injury, current state law only requires a city to provide them with the same temporary disability benefits paid to non-safety employees with no guarantee of continued medical benefits to injured lifeguards. What SB 559 seeks to do is remedy the situation. In the City of San Diego, lifeguards are covered fully by section 4850. In Los Angeles, lifeguards are covered fully. Imperial Beach has been left out.
9710	Runner	Sharon	4656	Ga_QNYq_wVM	2076	2096	Yes, some of the opposition, whether you oppose or support it, I think there needs to be procedure and I think going to the local appellate court is much better than ending up, years later, this has been probably five years in the case in San Diego, to do that.
9711	Dababneh	Matthew	50	gCJqYiGvi7w	674	688	We've talked about things like encrypted codes, smart barcoding, biometrics. When you talk to some of the experts on some of our pillars in the Silicon Valley community, they have talked to us about the technology they're using in their products to make sure e-commerce is safer.
9712	Frazier	Jim	114	PPBgSxp7D00	1216	1234	So, we do have a motion by Mr. Dodd and a second by Mr. Chiu. I'm going to be supporting your bill today, Mr. Chiu. While I hear the concerns of the opponents, I think there's a good argument to be made that expanded enforcement authorized by this bill especially
9713	Huff	Bob	105	VyoFcVtTJtQ	1502	1516	So I guess I'm trying to figure out why aren't we dealing with it in a way that strengthens and clarifies for the colleges how to report or how to get it into the criminal system because that's what it really is.
9714	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	j_gGP70jLkM	1313	1326	I want to thank everyone for their attention. I ask that you bring this home to your districts, that we continue the conversation as tomorrow is the official celebration day throughout the state and country and urge your aye vote.
9715	Leyva	Connie	62	VyoFcVtTJtQ	2189	2196	And then maybe they will report it and the crime will be taken care of. So I thank you for bringing this forward and I will be supporting your bill today.
9716	Alejo	Luis	9	fNO-vhR1Uas	1682	1700	The reason I'm asking is, a real question, whether a landlord can afford two to three, four thousand-dollars to do this, and in the meantime while their expectation may be that the landlord is going to provide that for their tenant, the reality  is that many arer not. Do we keep pointing fingers at the landlord or do we try to find a solution for the renters?
9717	McGuire	Mike	93	zWP9Ch_UvEs	1189	1215	We received a letter yesterday that is claiming that this bill would disclose private consumer information. Not only is that hogwash, it's disingenuous, disingenuous. This information being requested via this bill is already in existing local laws, 431 cities in 55 counties throughout California.
9718	Gomez	Jimmy	80	gmSplS1IxCE	538	552	And I think that this piece of legislation helps do that for the first-time in 20 years. The two bills that we merged were two different approaches but with both with very good ideas.
9719	McGuire	Mike	93	j_YjnTPR-gU	1682	1694	But I do think that's gonna be important, as that is the Senate's bill related to energy efficiency and cutting greenhouse gas emissions. But my bottom line is, we need to look at a glide path.
9720	Mitchell	Holly	64	A1UTGLmNv2E	1031	1063	While we all know the high recidivism rate elsewhere. Thank you very much for allowing me to introduce you all to Mr. Robbins, Sober Williams, Melissa Striver, who's joining him today to talk to you in a little bit and to introduce to some of you the work of the prison project. Madam President, we've got, recieved permission was approved through the Rules Committee yesterday to allow Mr Robbins to share a few words on the floor.
9721	Cannella	Anthony	61	iXqi4cKnhU8	749	784	One thing in particular that impressed me about this gentleman, is that he kept referring to the folks that he provides services to as customers and I thought that was, I thought that was good because, you know, I rely on, I don't if its your particular department, there are so many departments, but it's nice to be treated as a customer.  And when you're a state worker, working for other state department's, I think that occasionally there could be an attitude where I'll get to what I get to it and, I think by calling them customers means that they're important they have imporatnt services to provide the constituents of California.  So I think that's great.  So, I have no further questions.
9722	Thurmond	Tony	4	XHIZ_X2Rz9c	442	494	Well, if I'm ever on the other end of that, just call me, okay? But facts don't lie. And we have to, as emotional as these issues are, we have to deal with the facts, and you pointed out that basically, with no disrespect to your members, sir, that a lot of companies are making money while the people that we care about suffer. And I appreciate the hardships that those who have done the investigations and have to make a call. Why you're reporting somebody? I totally get it, that we have to do better. And I guess the only thing I can ask is why? Why has this been allowed to happen? If we all care, we all care about who's in care, we all know that it should be better.
9723	Bonta	Rob	85	hecrzVTBfRM	1121	1137	I entirely agree that we need to act and act now with implementing the overtime provisions and also addressing the 7% cut. So thank you for the action that is on the table and I look forward to supporting them.
9724	Nguyen	Janet	65	hqvUVHybZBI	515	527	And so, I again thank you Mr. Chairman for your reconsideration of looking at a broader approach of private colleges. Not only that, but also to potentially help these students. Thank you.
9725	Bonilla	Susan	3	n6Y2Iw6dcYo	417	435	You know, there can be oral exams. If somebody does have a literacy issue, you can give an oral exam. I don't have, I mean, I think there's just an opportunity here to say that you know, we don't always have to just continue doing what we've done because we've always done it.
9726	Quirk	Bill	23	zxWUxjOp--I	249	273	I would just like to say something about the CES 21. There was a question there in the materials we were given about why it was Lowrance Livermore Lab then that whole process. I'd like to say that there were many hearings, Lawrence Livermore was made the lead on this.
9727	Stone	Mark	20	leLv2BAfLGY	1014	1032	having somebody seeing you with no clothes on. And that just goes to the wonderful, dedicated people that we've seen testify over the past four or five months. I wanna just applaud all of you that are the providers, what a great job that you do, and what tremendous sacrifices you've made.
9728	Leno	Mark	60	mzRsScITOGM	89	107	They describe their mission as quote, serving the public interest, by protecting consumers and ensuring the provision of safe, reliable utilities service and infrastructure at reasonable rates. So, keep that in mind as we review all that's happened in recent years.
9729	Leno	Mark	60	4eIdwcDuXeo	1101	1114	With regard to, we the state making problem any worse, with these recent revelations and now the address of it by the EPA with regard to the potential, if not fact, of contamination of aquifers  throughout the state, is that discomforting to you?
9730	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	KZTa69-ElFQ	1597	1608	I've been to some other arts programs where I thought it was very effective and I don't know if you track it. So, that's kind of where we are right now before we take a vote on this.
9731	Quirk	Bill	23	qW3ZYP7zbss	304	333	To the extent that we are losing people who should get those Visas and, you can address this as well, that is an issue and if there is something we can do, do tell us that because that is going to be very important, particularly in terms of being able to convict traffickers by being able to have those people here feeling secure and feeling that they can then testify so the UNT's are clearly very important and I know you're going to address that as well so go ahead.
9732	Waldron	Marie	29	BsDlxjqmuUc	151	176	AB 68 passed the Assembly floor unanimously and is supported by AFSCME, the Association of Regional Center Agencies, Biocom, California Chronic Care Coalition, California Healthcare Institute, California Life Sciences Association, Child Neurology Foundation, Disability Rights California, Epilepsy California, and Sunovion Pharmaceutical.
9733	Bonta	Rob	85	sO4d30mS8eM	1179	1197	because it's based in data, it's evidence driven, evidence based, and will make a huge difference. We know that there are strong inequities that are already existed before our young people, our young Californians get to kindergarten. So, I appreciate your leadership and I also wanna give a special shout out to the Bay Area Council.
9734	Leno	Mark	60	PdAu9Oh2C5Q	635	664	Okay. Thank you. Any other questions? So again, mostly technical in nature with the exception of the removal of the sunset that allows for the SPWB, State Public Works Board, to enter into an asset transfer and lease for purposes of securing the payment of debt service. We have a motion by Senator Ross. Call the roll, please.
9735	Glazer	Steve	10481	YaTK7ym74zw	980	1004	I don't want to erase their names from our history books, I just don't want our children looking up to people who fought to preserve a system that treated human beings as chattel. That's the basis for my legislation, SB 539, the Frederick Douglas Liberty Act. Which seeks to remove the names of elected and military leaders of the Confederacy from all public places, including street signs and schools.
9736	Huff	Bob	105	tX-iRiZ5OnY	1006	1025	But that is a project that would clearly qualify, because we've already done modeling on that. And at that time we were more focused because we didn't have AB 32 in place. We were more focused on the nox and the particulates and things like that. But nevertheless, the difference between mobility and sitting waiting for grade separation would qualify for this very thing you're talking about.
9737	Leno	Mark	60	XQwWN6GsS_M	2014	2032	Somehow, this is now my ninth conference committee. I don't know how that happened.  But if I've learned anything through that process, it's how much I still have to learn. Is just a never ending learning process.
9738	Moorlach	John	4657	5xYY96cBqDg	673	682	Some of it. You've got 64 and a half million of depreciable. And I'm just really curious what would you have if you've sold a The hospital. What is 64?
9739	Williams	Das	12	X5ZwfIJ2xIA	1045	1074	The journey towards equality is difficult. But the work of Doctor King shows that we can have progress. Although injustice continues to this very day we must be diligent and continue the struggle. As servants of the public, let's make a commitment to furthering the work of Doctor King, not just celebrating it as a holiday. Please join me in voting aye for this important measure in honor of Doctor King's life and work.
9740	Medina	Jose	81	QruWeQOWjh0	510	530	Thank you. Is there a motion?  No. Move by Miss Baker. Second by Mister Bloom. Nope. I'm sorry. Second by Mr. Williams. So the motion is do pass to appropriation committee. Madam Secretary.
9741	Hill	Jerry	66	yzBzen_uFsA	2262	2285	Do we have a motion? I'll move the bill. Oh, I'm sorry. Because you have your light on most of the time Senator Leno, so I didn't know if you wanted to talk or not. Or you're just always, you're always, you're always the, in, in search.
9742	Chavez	Rocky	83	vE1aI3Q_hng	280	304	I appreciate that, I'm just trying to understand the logic. Sure. My next point is on AB 2109 and I went back and saw your testimony that you did on why you did it. Your logic there appears to be opposite to the logic you have today. So give me, not talking about this bill, what was your logic on AB 2109?
9743	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	akOKQetVqu4	445	458	And then we talked, we spend a lot of time on young people. Well, what about that demographic that our Butte County registrar recorder was talking about the 40-- well, I mentioned to her the 40 to 64 group.
9744	Chiu	David	7	xgyg6J1mIL4	778	787	And actually, if I could ask, another fault to that I know that LAO will be presenting some of the stakeholder proposals but there have been a number of specific proposals around increasing
9745	Alejo	Luis	9	iF8zLPAheNg	256	270	And these cases now expose family owned farms all across the state, millions of dollars and liability and these farmers were not bad actors, they were law-abiding individuals and companies that were simply following the guidelines that were set forth to them by the labor Commission.
9746	Liu	Carol	63	WPX0fE7wHjw	1223	1261	But anyway, we have determined, in terms of age limit and service that these two elements are the starting points of where rising cost of our prison system happens. And as we all know we have put much more money into these areas as opposed to investing in our young people, in schools, et cetera. So with that I just hope that you consider supporting the bill, and moving it forward.
9747	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	G-cKeAHj51U	176	190	And I would make another point because this came up a couple of months ago. This bill would not apply to a special election that needed to be called. That's kinda the scenario that you play out, if someone needed to call an emergency question on the ballot. A locality or an entity that causes an election would still be able to do so under this bill. As with a couple of previous bills that were in the assembly of last year. I don't know if you heard that, but...
9748	Baker	Catharine	74	UDPqIWouyOQ	2135	2147	Thank you Mr. Speaker. Just a question of the author. Thank you. I understand that given the concerns about the bill that our colleague from Merced mentioned that you're in good faith going to be working with him as this goes forward.
9749	Dahle	Brian	47	B7tknBLcV5o	426	438	Hopefully, we will do the right thing, and we will take some of this information and implement it in a way that actually benefits California. And hopefully, drive the rate down. At the end of the day, I'm a farmer. We use energy to pump water. And I have to be competitive to stay in business.
9750	Williams	Das	12	2gM15KHmKpo	1405	1420	This bill also specifies what types of waste disposal records are subject to inspection and copying by CalRecycle and prohibits a government entity from disclosing specified information unless necessary as part of an administrative or judicial proceeding.
9751	Thurmond	Tony	4	merVIEmEWtA	1714	1741	We don't want to make it so damn hard. Have any states ever approached it in that way?  I'm saying as a credit, not as something tied to your tax return, that as a guaranteed credit if you fall in deep poverty, that you would be eligible and this would be your credit. We'd say Mr. Haney, we're proud to have you in our citizenry. We know that you're on hard times.
9752	Wieckowski	Bob	55	en7JgK3RrhY	960	978	Because as we see our economy, the integration of jobs, not everybody has to go all the way to San Francisco to get their job. I mean, some people do, but some people go on different routes and they need to connect. And that's one of the opportunities that I think we've missed out on so far.
9753	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	dSqmLCv394A	1675	1701	If that's your pleasure, then I have no problem with that whatsoever. Very good. All right, no problem. We'll start then. We'll go to file item eight, AB 883. And good afternoon assemblymen, and please two witnesses in support.
9754	Chiu	David	7	ASNmI2rHU9I	513	534	Yes, let me just make just a couple comments. I think that this is a very difficult bill for, for me to align myself with, because I do believe that, and, I, I do completely support the transparency piece that I believe that this industry needs to be a bit more transparent.
9755	Pavley	Fran	104	AO5QavLO0SY	483	499	Thank you very much, to add onto what Pro Tem just said on 9/11. Just a little historical perspective, a couple of us were actually in the Legislature on 9/11, it was the last week of session.
9756	Gomez	Jimmy	80	rXqXXOdeL9w	1112	1123	Thank you. Questions or comments from the committee members? Seeing none, Mr., well I was gonna ask you to close but, we have a motion by Wood. A second by Rendon. This bill is out on the B roll call.
9757	Wagner	Donald	88	ITEaoTWbk6c	1654	1687	If you've got something that you don't think is going to get as many votes as you might like for it but it's still going to pass, be up front with it. Put it out there. Let us vote up or down and take the heat in our district or take the credit in our district. But this sort of action, sticking stuff in bills that they don't seem to be related to, at least there was no answer yet as to how it's related to drought, I just want to say as somebody who's been here a long-time.
9758	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	SQUPcyDaRgg	298	324	Yes, sorry. I appreciate that this is a very serious issue and I am far more interested in our ability to control that information than parsing out what state agency we anticipate might think about possibly at some point in time wanting to use it. I agree with both of you.
9759	Weber	Shirley	44	jRDlxywi7uQ	73	91	This bill was the subject of an intensive hearing earlier this week in the Policy Committee. We're here today to consider the financial implications of the bill and I wanna focus on that, the financial implications of this bill. The Department of Finance has informed the Committee that they have no file on this bill at this time.
9760	Leyva	Connie	62	7E5hMfSVPig	390	405	So I had the opportunity to go on what is lovingly called the toxic tour in my district a few weeks ago, and I'm very grateful for that, because if we don't know about issues, then we don't have the opportunity to fix those issues.
9761	Wagner	Donald	88	rOcxPrNyERc	614	631	Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Briefly, I'm gonna rise in opposition, both the floor manager and our friend from San Diego just stated quite accurately this is a relatively small bill, just a small expansion of what we've done before and therein lies the nub of the problem.
9762	Liu	Carol	63	n5MXFS_19l0	0	17	Assembly Member Williams please join us. You have item 14, AB 967 and item 15, AB 968. We'll give a minute for the room to clear and you'll be only talking to us.
9763	Garcia	Eduardo	38	h4u4YccC9Z8	41	55	AB 434 is a bill that is necessary to provide clean and safe drinking water to many communities throughout the state of California. Particularly areas in the eastern parts of Coachella Valley and the Central Valley.
9764	McGuire	Mike	93	gqFKPQ41Jk4	1378	1395	That federal rule and its the nors reporting threshold has a mandatory report in a community or an area a region that has 900,000 minutes and you have to have a 30 minute outage and you get a mandatory call out Residents know when utilities can be there to be able to fix that service. Right now rural California that does not happen.
9765	Dodd	Bill	71	F7lT9yIrGAY	609	622	This requests also askes the State Auditor to provide information on any related revenue increases to local fire departments providing critical safety services for a sampling of campuses in their surrounding communities.
9766	Lara	Ricardo	107	YZmREa72UrQ	1066	1082	Wildlife habitat restoration and protection and watershed improvements, within the boundaries of the conservancy. The territory of the RMC includes the watersheds of the San Gabriel River, and the lower Los Angeles River. Along with portions of the Santa Clara River and the lower Santa Ana River.
9767	Quirk	Bill	23	bsC6VSsjVLI	1178	1191	AB 764 allows the California Building Standards Commission in collaboration with the state architect and the state fire marshal, to consider building standards for the installation of vehicle barriers.
9768	Mitchell	Holly	64	yp3pHtPtFfM	340	350	So in the examples, the experiences we've had with the programs or department where we've used, utilized zero base budget, budgeting as a processor methodology have we been closer to the mark?
9769	Melendez	Melissa	41	rW1B4Jx9iIw	1342	1360	But my question for you is, what are you doing to make sure that that report does meet its statutory requirements of a July first deadline? Because that helps us to do our job, and understand the full picture. When we don't have all of the numbers and the full report, that makes it significantly more difficult.
9770	Roth	Richard	106	0HDXR-Yl1D8	1168	1191	And we know that in 1991, when the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued its ADA handbook with accessibility guidelines, the handbook itself was over 600 pages long. Since then, of course, efforts have been made to conform standards and to make things easier for business to comply but the point is, it's still complicated.
9771	Monning	Bill	25	-8HmkVu5hs8	1973	1997	And then we've heard in all of the hearings some families with a child with immune deficiency who is opposed to the bill, but correct me if I'm wrong, a child with an immune deficiency there is greater protection for that child in a school environment if more of the school children are vaccinated, is that an accurate statement?
9772	Garcia	Eduardo	38	OHndMPLrpTA	752	775	In the last several weeks, there has been light shed on another company, that will go unnamed in the interest of those companies. As what we've done here with this resolution, we've taken out the name of a specific company. And we're asking that the federal government look at all of these alleged-
9773	Cooley	Ken	45	kLTY4thtXsA	200	213	So this bill's, I would say outstanding feature in the medical marijuana conversation, is to have a single agency to distinct it through all the facets of marijuana regulation.
9774	Hernandez	Ed	103	gnd2v7Ro_Uo	1715	1737	From the affected area, okay, so the concern I had with the prior mechanism is the ability for the public to see was going on. I'm assuming they'd have to follow the Brown Act and open meetings acts, etc., whereas some of the, my understanding, some of the previous authorities could be in closed session, they can make decisions. So all of this would be in public, in public domain then.
9775	Stone	Mark	20	9-tqw489jZ4	1015	1033	has great benefits by putting money in the pockets of people in the areas of California that have not been recovering as California starts to come back from the recession. Money that people will spend, that's what drives the economy in areas of California that have not yet been touched by that recovery. This is
9776	Thurmond	Tony	4	2brqaJJ9EWY	628	646	Thank you. Any questions from committee members? I'd like to just ask you about the disaster preparedness aspect of this. I gotta be honest, as I read it I thought, this is a disaster, if we have three mobile hospitals and two of them are not in service. I thought, what in the world are we gonna do, right?
9777	Pavley	Fran	104	Ab32yuFXwvM	1028	1051	These deadlines are now in part reflected in the emergency regulations. And I wanted to just share with you, and I think you can hear my growing concern. We can't trade our energy policy, for protecting our water supply. And the priorities in DOGGR, I don't think, it allow us to provide that necessary oversight.
9778	Hill	Jerry	66	8s6GBqKeNwE	392	415	I mean, and they clearly stated to the contrary, to a failure to act occurs, that those cases where courts have issues such injunctions upon finding a failure to act within in a reasonable time, the have done so. Only by examining, after examining all the facts in the case. So it's a case by case basis when they determine that. Why do you feel that this is important at this point, contrary to the FCC ruling?
9779	Garcia	Cristina	112	ZmQN_cLb26Y	48	64	The purpose is to continue to insure that the families of deceased California residents can have a person who they trust to respect the wishes of the departed administering his or her estate. With me to testify is Larry Doyle and Ciaran O'Sullivan with Conference of California Bar Associations.
9780	Irwin	Jacqui	16	w_O6rMiIuwc	104	118	All right and, AB 240 by Assembly Member Wilk is going to be put over until our next hearing pursuant to a Committee rule 2C, so that we may process the authors amendments that were received today.
9781	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	oC8-KbPE6Yo	337	351	This bill does two things. First, it explicitly authorizes the lead agency at the request of the project applicant to prepare the record of proceedings during the CEQA process.
9782	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	mNyHP9HDpqk	1531	1542	society is better off if people are healthier and can live longer, be more productive and be less sick. I think that's what this bill attempts to do. You can speak to that Mr. Holden.
9783	McGuire	Mike	93	a71Txrj65NA	745	768	Treatment of cancer, heart disease, strokes, lung disease, diabetes, and other diseases related to tobacco continues to impose a significant burden on California's overstressed health care system. Moreover, smoking disproportionately affects low-income communities in California.
9784	Brown	Cheryl	13	kIKVbsrTmqg	205	227	We had others that testified that 1/4 of households who rely on the program are taking care of grandchildren. We've had others that talked about homelessness and unstable living arrangements. And that waiting for affordable housing is six to seven years.
9785	Achadjian	K.H. "Katcho"	5	Rt-g3tEX78Q	1304	1345	I would also like to welcome Will Zurnchic with the IPDAF who is very dedicated to this great cause. I want to thank you for all that you have done to bring attention to rare disease. Ladies and gentlemen, colleagues, please join me again in welcoming them to the Assembly floor.
9786	Allen	Travis	43	0KJVRFCFgZY	2072	2083	Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and committee members. As you noted, I would like to waive presentation AB 192, which is a candidate for suspense, and my presentation on 232 I will keep very brief. I know you have a number of things to get through today.
9787	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	3kfM97VupkU	1874	1927	I just wanted to follow up for a second. I appreciate your comments. I mean I understand that this is all very thoughtfully done, but if there's nothing available now on the heavy ones and the goal is to reduce this air pollution issue. But it is available now on, what is it, the class five and six. Why not encourage the five and six now, and let the heavier truck manufacturers know that if they can meet these standards, there will be money available. Isn't that what motivates innovation, is the fact that there will be a reward at the financial reward at the end of the day. And perhaps, I mean, I'm sure these aren't new questions for you, but they're questions that are just sort of keeping me from being able to support the bill.
9788	Roth	Richard	106	JZLdEqkqLz4	1451	1465	So let me make sure I- So the total- That's okay, I've got a simple brain here. So the total amount at stake for Glendale as a city is $8 million and you've already been repaid $1.5 million.
9789	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	HgBIr1hupMw	216	244	We believe that our early care and education programs are an integral component of our state's education system and therefore could and frankly should be funded through Proposition 98. Indeed, large parts of early childhood education or ECE were funded through Prop 98 prior to the 2011-2012 fiscal year when at that point in time we started chopping the heads off of just about everything.
9790	Pan	Richard	96	4mB1nCFXohc	1799	1816	The problem is that it's the licensees who didn't go and ask for this system who are now stuck holding the bag, and are gonna be paying higher fees. Are paying higher fees for their licenses because of this failed system.
9791	Leno	Mark	60	xL36G7ytN6U	991	1022	Thank you madame President, colleagues. This bill deals with admission and disciplinary policies at our California public charter schools and, let me just state very clearly, I have some terrific charter schools in my district and this is in no way an assault on charter schools, I have seen first hand the many great benefits that they can provide.
9792	Perea	Henry	33	k0jwR3_bc5U	1331	1353	I am very familiar like all my colleagues through local government how difficult this is, so I appreciate you taking it on. If I can just mention one piece and section two. I actually like the idea of permits because I think it helps local government know where everything is and where everybody is.
9793	Mullin	Kevin	31	dKyb6eNIcTg	54	70	It's important to me that we get the language in the bill right to ensure that we're promoting clean technology. I plan to accept the proposed committee amendments, but ask the Chair's permission, if I may, to discuss the details of them very briefly.
9794	Williams	Das	12	5kU8DLIkLSI	422	456	And so to calculate that your staff is then saying well, we're gonna get some money from out of state enrollees. Well we will get some money from out of state enrollees. Particularly if you increase that or if you reduce the amount of financial aid they get but when you make it more expensive for out of state enrollees you can't completely calculate with certainty, how much out of state enrollees will come in.
9795	Hernandez	Ed	103	oSf6dq0DzcI	1611	1660	Is I think the one that's most disturbing is the fact that Texas has a 63% utilization rate compared to California, and if you look at Texas, Texas has some of the worst health outcomes in the country. Didn't do Medicaid expansion, and what does that tell you about California if we're at 44%? So, that to me is extremely disturbing. And I guess the question I have for the department when they come back up at the end unless they, well we'll have them come up back at the end is, we did this audit for Medi-Cal, but it's in state law in section 14079. It says, the director annually shall review the reimbursement levels for physician and dental services under the Medi-Cal, and shall revise periodically the rate of reimbursement to physicians and dentist to ensure the reasonable access to Medi-Cal beneficiaries to physicians and dental services.
9796	Bonta	Rob	85	oyj26fO_o0A	1056	1067	The API community in California is not homogenous. Each of our diverse API communities, has different social, economic, and educational experiences and outcomes that need to be addressed differently.
9797	Bonilla	Susan	3	kGJrWtDlyMM	1792	1806	However, since the standards were adopted, only $1.2 billion has been dedicated to the implementation of Common Core. This was a very critical first step. It had a huge impact in our schools and upon the morale of all of our educators. But it is not sufficient.
9798	Bonilla	Susan	3	54O2UbeLCuE	511	526	However, unfortunately, we have found that we have districts that are doing a cost shift and we know that their money is tight. I am incredibly sympathetic to the fact that we are not funding yet the way we need to our public education system.
9799	Brough	William	111	ullCtaxzBRw	305	314	Well the second part I have, do you have the ability in your office to create new programs or are there tools that we can give you to help you do your business better?
9800	Stone	Jeff	26	npLG8Ena6eQ	242	269	She was under hospice care and she had a morphine pump. And, that pump was left for us as the family that if we saw her spasming or if we felt as though she was in pain, that we could push that button. It was made very clear to me that if I wanted to push that button a little bit more than normal that I could take my mother's life.
9801	Wolk	Lois	94	nlURi31-KJY	1512	1522	Picnic Day and it gets a little rowdy and there's a lot of music and my Chief of Staff happens to have one of the rowdiest parties around but Dan was always there
9802	Stone	Jeff	26	npLG8Ena6eQ	269	293	And, I can't tell you how tempted I was to push that button. When I was in pharmacy school, I worked at a pharmacy in Hollywood on Poinsettia and Sunset called Liberty Pharmacy and I had a mentor whose name was Doctor Jim D. One of the most wonderful educators I ever worked with who went on to become a physician.
9803	Block	Marty	59	qnIAoFuwUn0	986	1001	So, so I would again ask that for the post May revise meeting we look at utilizing some funding for this. And with that I will ask colleagues if there are any other questions, comments. Senator Moorlach?
9804	Pan	Richard	96	Ew5hLn0iC0U	587	597	But I do think that if there's a problem that comes up that someone becomes aware of that the state of California, that their only recourse is not just the federal government or the tribe.
9805	Weber	Shirley	44	BcOJ4WzBt0M	1628	1639	And then when it gets to that level, it's like so many things, whether it's dealing with healthcare issues that we sometimes allocate to the county and state as a priority that we want something done in a certain area.
9806	Bonta	Rob	85	ZUYUeUTz98c	2011	2039	Thank you. Okay, seeing no further questions or public comment let's go on to the next item issue number three, Drug Medi-Cal Waiver May revised budget change proposal. Whenever you're ready.
9807	Santiago	Miguel	17	v8Lqd5JpuF0	66	75	Second bill I'd like to present on is AB 1373. AB 30, AB 1373 would allow the use of revenue generating advertisement within a small area of downtown Los Angeles.
9808	Lara	Ricardo	107	-Ah0Dbgfor4	817	835	SB 124 Juvenile Solitary Confinement. Do pass per author's amendments to narrow the definition of solitary confinement, remove mandates, and make other technical changes. Substitute the role from SB 454. That bill was approved on a five to two vote, with Republicans voting no.
9809	Baker	Catharine	74	D1U0Ojzunqk	1270	1287	And in my district as many are there's the question of local control. I'm going to stay off today, as this is really still being cooked, still being worked on, and we're going to see it again. But I wanted to provide the comments that I really hope you can go even further on the local control elements.
9810	Quirk	Bill	23	tEhMYBdIqkE	478	502	which could be also, human trafficking, so it's about 330 people in jail for that. Is this the tip of the iceberg, or is this indicative of sort of the level of the problem? It's obviously a big problem, whether the number is 330, or 3,000. But if we can get some idea of the extent to which we are able to
9811	Hall	Isadore	1	zxPLA2x-8Hc	132	158	the established policy in the Senate for ratification of tribal state compacts provides for an informational hearing, relative to the essence of a compact, and it is not amended by the Legislature. The vehicle for ratification of this compact has been identified as AB 315, authored by Assembly Member Bigelow, which is currently pending on the Senate Floor.
9812	De Leon	Kevin	102	BHYxE3t9U1s	1202	1226	Thank you very much, Senator Mitchell. Mr. Gould, without a doubt, looking at your resume. I know we didn't have an opportunity to meet, albeit somewhat very briefly, I think it was a governor's reception over at the railroad museum, it was it was very brief. But looking over your resume right now, obviously it is as impressive as it get.s
9813	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	V40hlwpKzww	1503	1525	Because you say here that this, giving the nurse practitioner the ability to assess patients, synthesize and analyze data, and apply principles of healthcare. So, are we giving them, and then it talks about establishing a diagnosis by client history, physical examination and other criteria, so.
9814	Beall	Jim	92	hQoyRwEukvY	1062	1102	We will now hear from any public speakers that would like to address us. Are there any people who would like to address us? Okay, let's hear from some public. Okay sir, why don't we start over here. Introduce yourself for the record.
9815	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	-O56kS7yA2Y	1795	1816	Hi, now I've been a proponent of body cameras for quite some time. And I know there's been a lot of discussion about when you have shootings or there's some altercations, and we've gone on that for quite some time, and I have a question on that.
9816	Hancock	Loni	98	A1UTGLmNv2E	2375	2389	In 1960, she moved to California and again and again and again broke racial barriers being the first African-American to work in various companies and various offices of the United States government. In 1975, she moved to Oakland and worked for the Social Security Administration until she retired in 1986.
9817	Allen	Benjamin	70	gAWN8j6c6Vc	1829	1845	Well that's a good point. I mean especially, now of course in this case, the rules as we all discussed before, were the opposite problem, right. That if you know, if the government didn't respond within about ten days, the project could go forward.
9818	Wieckowski	Bob	55	vpNS8YXwTNY	1219	1268	Others opposed to SB350. Alright, let's bring it back to the committee. Senator Leno, we hear a lot of comments. I guess I don't want to parse this up, but on the energy side of this, which was dealt with the energy utilities and transportation commission, this is the environmental quality committee. So, like yesterday I was doing the, I was on judiciary hearing dealt with the due process challenges of the vaccination. Not all the health and all the others. So if we could, if you could, they raised some questions about a more comprehensive or general standard and if you can address some of the concerns that were raised with the environmental quality lens, we would appreciate that.
9819	Cooper	Jim	21	-O56kS7yA2Y	1777	1795	So, from just my tour of that facility, and talking to those folks, their technology folks, it's pretty airtight, where no one can go in and alter that video. So I just wanna thank you guys for coming out here and, oh, I 'm sorry, Mr. Jones-Sawyer, excuse me.
9820	Alejo	Luis	9	J0XgdYqFY4Y	553	563	of Salinas. So much so that I had to call, go back and try to help, working with the police departments, calming people's frustration and anger, so this is something that
9821	Hancock	Loni	98	A1UTGLmNv2E	2324	2342	She won a scholarship to Tillotson College in Austin Texas. Later attended the Southern University in Baton Rouge. When pledging a sorority at Southern University, she found that a friend of hers was not asked to join because of her darker skin color.
9822	Wagner	Donald	88	RsqrHgBrOM8	1543	1563	I also don't usually comment on suspense items, but this one seems like an absolute no brainer to me. And it seems like there's some questions that have been raised with respect to the availability of photos for ID cards and a possible conflict with federal law. Because it was suspense I honestly didn't do as much digging in to this as I should have.
9823	Moorlach	John	4657	a71Txrj65NA	2072	2080	Thank you. Just for my clarification, is this something that the Board of Supervisors would vote on and improve themselves? Or are they voting to put it on a ballot so the voters would approve the tax?
9824	McGuire	Mike	93	e-eay8FdlZA	687	702	And so that's why, if I seem like I've lost patience a bit, it's just we need to be able to move on this and not operate in the silos that I've believe that we currently are. And that's not just all on the state, right, but that's within the county level as well.
9825	Hueso	Ben	48	MJvFThfrsHs	885	903	A limitation that was not required nor contemplated in SB 43. And that's what we want to do with this bill. We want to make clear that that kind of flexibility is really essential to make sure that these programs are workable. So, I would ask for your aye vote.
9826	Bonta	Rob	85	oyj26fO_o0A	1488	1500	As you know, CCS is a vital program that our most medically vulnerable children with diseases such as hemophilia, congenital heart disease, cerebral palsy and other severe conditions benefit from.
9827	Ting	Philip	30	JgUoeRvgl3U	401	417	Or they're a place where we go when we decide we wanna change careers and take computer programming, or culinary, or any variety of courses. They are frankly the backbone of our economy. The accreditation of our community colleges is a peer review process meant to insure academic performance.
9828	Mendoza	Tony	52	TF5gOrTe590	1725	1740	Most people don't even know the difference, and they take care of you just the same. So, I'm not going to say that they're not as good. I mean, I think for many people they'd rather have something rather than nothing. And, this is a step in a certain direction that I think, and I appreciate your comments Jodi.
9829	Mitchell	Holly	64	ofo4g2uUHBA	257	279	Through that, the Select Committee on Autism had a hearing, or several hearings. Through the budget in 12-13, we required the Department of Regional Centers to annually compile data related to purchase of service authorization, utilization expenditure, because the disparity reflected ethnically.
9830	Leyva	Connie	62	SM79vxJ_AdE	1400	1408	Start by registering people to vote and then, we'll work hard to inspire them, and want them to believe in government. And hopefully, we'll get more of them to the polls.
9831	Chau	Ed	116	7f5uDPxTBXo	86	104	AB 195 will hold websites accountable for the content that they promote and also provide law enforcement agencies with a tool to deter those who wish to commit decide crimes. With that, I have two witnesses here today I'd like to ask them to introduce themselves.
9832	De Leon	Kevin	102	bB6-EJZQbO8	1378	1407	There is an address from the judiciary. We will convene here at two o'clock. We will conduct Senate business at 3:30. We'll meet here as well as a group so we can collectively walk together at 3:45 PM to the Assembly chambers so we can listen to the state judiciary a speech by the Chief Justice of the California State Supreme Court. Again, have a very wonderful and productive weekend.
9833	Beall	Jim	92	AI_qbYqntVY	688	699	Okay. Thank you Senator Pavley. We will take a vote on this item when we reach a quorum. Appreciate you attending the meeting, presenting your bill. We'll go next to Senator House bill. This is item two.
9834	Hueso	Ben	48	OIbMOKdbCjk	1197	1223	Thank you Madame Chair. I also want to remind the public that this ACR is also about the Latino community. We have our fair share of African-American Latinos in this state and it's important to recognize their contributions as well and I thank the author for bringing this issue forward and we just wanna weigh in and express our gratitude to the Latinos in our community as well. Thank you.
9835	Block	Marty	59	HrV-lrSKHCA	31	62	First article is titled, "Dentist Kept Practicing After Fire in Face." It begins, "In June 2007, the Dental Board of California put Rancho Bernardo dentist Ray Michael Smith on probation for five years in response to a series of incidents, including one in which a patient was burned when an oxygen fire line erupted in her face." That was in 1999 This was in 19, sorry, in 2007, he was put on probation.
9836	Pavley	Fran	104	lDuIIZpOpfs	597	623	So I want to thank all four of you for your continued efforts on behalf of Californians everywhere, we appreciate you.  Thank you. And we're going on to panel two, I know we're running late but this has been actually, timely and fascinating. Senator Wolk will be chairing this segment.
9837	Mendoza	Tony	52	mork537FlJg	745	768	Thank you, Mr. Chair, members. While I understand that SCA 8 will go to suspense, I appreciate you allowing me to make a brief presentation to respond to the fiscal concerns that have been raised. This is a bipartisan measure that will require that any county that has 2 million or more residents, based upon the 2020 census, add two seats to their Board of Supervisors.
9838	Leno	Mark	60	gvsFAuMIegs	1395	1416	It requires the department of Health and Human Services, Developmental Services Task Force. So, there is a task force. That will make recommendations on overall rate revisions and that's going to be now a big part of the special session.
9839	Leyva	Connie	62	XFSLCFM97Og	889	910	There was one question I was going to ask you, and I did not ask, and it is about collection rates. Forty-six percent of households headed up by females live in poverty. For any other families, it's about 19 percent. So what can we do-- the collection rates are about 65 percent. What can we do to try and help improve that?
9840	Gallagher	James	108	OqtPmd4MeNE	2038	2050	But, but tying it to have to exactly follow those procedures, I could see how that might become problematic down the road, like if there's something that is put into those standards that, I don't know, is just something that wouldn't work here in California.
9841	Leyva	Connie	62	Fo002GsDq6Y	1781	1792	Okay, it'll be quick. Until I was elected to the Senate recently, my dealings with the PUC was just about like everyone else, a rate-payer. I appreciate your comments Mr. Howard about the lawlessness,
9842	Stone	Mark	20	nJnCDFBqZA4	380	404	It's not that the judge, the conservators are there, but I think what the concern is that because this is an individual, the judge, who is not currently the one making the decision about moving somebody into an LPS conservatorship. I think the fear is that now there will be more of those investigations and that is one of the cost drivers.
9843	Quirk	Bill	23	gLFdVIp2-Nc	527	544	And managed the California Pathways long-term greenhouse gas reduction scenario analysis with the state's energy agencies, which has since become the beginning point for our journey here to lower greenhouse gases in 2030.
9844	Beall	Jim	92	zWP9Ch_UvEs	695	703	Can we have a little quiet in the room please? Could we have a little quiet in the room so that Senator McGuire can present his bill? Thank you very much. Senator, you have the floor.
9845	Block	Marty	59	m_1fhqTgwb8	1923	1933	Thank you, Madam Chair. As I travel my district in the San Diego area, It seems clear to me that there are winners and losers in school facilities. In the north of my district, Del Mar district, you have high property values, lot of bonding possibilities, the parents overwhelmingly support local bond measures and school facilities reflect that.
9846	Patterson	Jim	119	kGJrWtDlyMM	560	574	Blind vendors operating vending machines at rest stops in California are forced to pay an additional fee on top of the same 6% set aside that their counterparts at state-owned buildings pay to cover power costs.
9847	Olsen	Kristin	15	UDPqIWouyOQ	1270	1286	In order to turn that around and raise student achievement levels in California, we have to do two things. We have to make sure that our schools are properly funded and we have to make sure we're doing the reforms that are necessary to make sure that we have effective teachers in every school classroom
9848	Quirk	Bill	23	seV-S-c1PNk	1253	1271	Alright, so I agree with the two gentlemen sitting here and with a number of my other friends in the motorcycle community that lane splitting will save lives of motorcyclists because the rear end collisions are much more dangerous than what might happen lane splitting.
9849	Mitchell	Holly	64	LCBofa05MII	557	575	I appreciate the opportunity to present to you a Senate Bill 227 which prohibits the use of a Criminal Grand Jury when evidence indicated a peace officer's use of excessive force or firearm contributed to the death of a person being detained or arrested by the peace office.
9850	De Leon	Kevin	102	A4tFO9bb3f0	533	549	Thank you much. Further opposition? Further oppositions? Seeing none, okay, those who are agnostic, who want to comment? Seeing none, okay, fantastic. Let's move forward with the nominations that are before us.
9851	Leno	Mark	60	J-efxTqVOiQ	793	807	On page one, with both the Senate and Governor taking no action, difference between the Houses is some trailer bill language, that the Assembly took up and wondered if you could help us better understand it.
9852	Alejo	Luis	9	9NVb2cnRnt4	2108	2120	Yesterday were talking the leaders of the Silicon Valley leadership group they are all in support of this because they know that if are going to have robust recovering economy it requires us to also make sure we are reinvesting money in our roads and highways.
9853	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	bB6-EJZQbO8	420	439	Single parenthood is not uncommon in the United States with 28% of children living with a single-parent. In California, poverty rates are higher for children living with single mothers, almost 45.7% than for those of married couple families, which is 15.5% or with a single father which is 30%.
9854	Liu	Carol	63	Laqdju9yTYg	230	256	I would be interested in seeing what happens after six months or a year to your findings and whether or not we can make some subsequent changes in the penal system or health system to address some of the issues that we are finding our population having difficulties with.  So, it's not a question just a comment observation.
9855	Wieckowski	Bob	55	HJEL7SBoV-4	1087	1102	I have just a concern with the word irrelevant in here. I mean, I think in the law, I can understand that it would be inadmissible, because we're used to evidence. And it can certainly be offensive, I get that.
9856	Beall	Jim	92	0ONi8JCQxHk	118	139	There are people, this is broadcast throughout the state of California, and your flash photography interferes with people in California watching our proceedings. We also have a rule of no holding up signs. Do not hold up your signs, please. Appreciate it very much.
9857	Leno	Mark	60	Jsr4ST1itp0	246	272	Thank you. If we can contain Mr. Ridley Thomas, I'll get started. All right. Thank you, Mr. Chair and committee members. This bill, specifically, can help California contain our healthcare costs and also keep our workforce healthier. In 2011, with the help of many in this room, we passed a bill which the Governor signed which brought transparency to
9858	Lara	Ricardo	107	tHDAU5JmwzE	904	924	Next author is senator Delian SB 185, public retirement systems. Divestiture of thermal coal companies do pass to amend to delete the study on fossil fuels investments, substitute the role from SB 454. That was approved on a five to two vote with Republicans voting no.
9859	Cannella	Anthony	61	VV_hLy-Z-e8	695	705	What happens is the, the councils in the general law city do not have the ability on their own to approve district elections, so they may say yes we agree, we're going to draw the,
9860	McGuire	Mike	93	msHMXzeLRF8	422	455	And only 37% of children receiving anti-psych medications are receiving the necessary medical lab test and screenings that is essential to protect kids from suffering long term serious side effects. And we also learned from the Department of Social Services and do want to say thank you along with the Healthcare Services Department, that they have been working to begin to address these long term issues through the quality improvement project which is compiling data and establishing a series of outcome measurements to help understand the scope of the problem.
9861	Gomez	Jimmy	80	uKMBP4F7FFc	1233	1246	Great. Questions or comments from the Committee Members? Seeing none, it's good to see the Riverside Unified School District here since I was a graduate from the school district, so it's good to see that they're here. Mr. Huff, would you like to close?
9862	Cooley	Ken	45	hqvUVHybZBI	1218	1241	Very good. Colleagues, good morning. It's a pleasure to be here on behalf of Farmer Jim Cooper. His AB 751 relates to the Vertebrate Pest Control Research Program. So this is rats, gophers, coyotes, all manner of vertebrate pests that effect the agricultural sector here in the state of California.
9863	McCarty	Kevin	22	nugSHhjUz14	1237	1248	Teacher loan forgiveness is an issue that has been forgotten in the great recession so we're gonna restart the Apple program providing loan forgiveness for new teachers entering the teaching profession.
9864	Block	Marty	59	2PhBo_voi0A	736	743	And I do want to make clear, Senator Vidak is not the in-principle co-author, he is in fact a joint author for this bill; his name is on the bill as well.
9865	Hernandez	Roger	37	1E-hERPJ9VM	523	539	Beyond that, at least we have a five-year window to work to identify additional and ongoing resources beyond that or continued resources for Prop 63 as Prop 63 is a proposition that provides for ongoing, perpetuating taxation.
9866	Hancock	Loni	98	1XQMI2ofb7Y	446	456	That was actually a very compelling moment for me. I think that is an absolutely correct idea. We rely on pie charts to give us an idea of the whole.
9867	Hueso	Ben	48	-IqFWVcq77k	1361	1385	A concern and I think people now have a valid concern to say, what's going on behind the scenes here? This is information that relates to either our safety or our rates or our delivery of services or where these services are located.
9868	Cooley	Ken	45	CToLtc1eO8I	1737	1764	So I just want to say, you're finishing up your schooling, you're looking to work in this area, to persevere to become a lawyer that can emulate other great lawyers you've known to make a difference in people's lives and I just want to say, we don't know why all the things come into our life, but like that building says.
9869	Thurmond	Tony	4	v8EYhSKM6wc	867	886	I think we should be showering all of our teachers, and staff, and parents, and students with the opportunity to have rich professional development. That aspect of your bill has me. It has me, and I'm with you there. I have faith in you Dr. Weber. I have faith in you to want to reach the bottom line to see kids be successful.
9870	Low	Evan	11	kGJrWtDlyMM	933	942	This will bring clarity to the educational code, and according to CSU, this bill provides no additional costs and is consistent with current policies. I respectfully ask for an aye vote.
9871	De Leon	Kevin	102	kH2FXJE6T-g	1745	1759	Okay. Thank you. Thank you so very much. We have more members of the audience who want to speak in favor of Mr. Xavier. I am going to ask you to keep your comments as brief as possible. We have some other appointments that are before this committee, so  please next witness.
9872	Jones-Sawyer	Reginald	87	-OpN4Uo7BxE	1161	1179	Because of the actions that happened in the Supreme Court, those protection are in jeopardy, and at the end of the day with the help of the secretary of state, we will have pre-clearance and an opportunity to know ahead of time whether or not citizens can vote in every county in California. So I respectfully ask for your aye vote.
9873	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	a6D1KFF96cc	1276	1293	Thank you very much. Let's hear the full, and then Senator Hertzberg has a question for you which we'll get to as soon as we go through those all in support, we'll have any questions you might have. This is a, an interesting discussion. Sir?
9874	Grove	Shannon	77	9NVb2cnRnt4	87	110	Caltrans is overstaffed by 3500 and employees costing taxpayers $500 million. California state departments play personnel shell game to keep tax dollars and empty jobs. The Parks Association that we experienced last year where they were crying and they didn't have any money and all of a sudden have a slush fund.
9875	Burke	Autumn	6	LiSz4J23j1Q	671	688	This is my last question. 'Cause I do believe the people should have the information, and I do believe in transparency. So I just have one question. What information is different on the opt out form than you are proposing that is on the opt in form?
9876	Huff	Bob	105	HutoDdelxCc	177	187	We are in a point where it appears that our May revision of the budget is going to have more resources than our January did.  I saw an article yesterday and they said we had a billion dollars more just this last month.
9877	Gallagher	James	108	FGjC95aJgzI	104	115	So AB 285 would update this provision by only requiring an LDA to register with the County Clerk in their primary county of practice and in any county in which they maintain a branch office.
9878	Wood	Jim	72	RK37B-MMwt0	1651	1659	And it's important that the students are going to get a great experience, but the protection of the public is paramount here. So I firmly believe that we need that.
9879	Chiu	David	7	rek1UfAle3c	120	134	We live in a state that includes about 10% of our US population but 20% of our country's homeless a half a million homeless children, a million and a half families who don't have access to an affordable home.
9880	Obernolte	Jay	86	pgW_T12xdBU	239	258	Now the Human Services Committee staff members have come up with a number of I think very good points about the bill and proposed amendments and also I understand that the State Controller's Office has some proposed amendments and should the bill passed through this Committee today I'm committed to working with both of those agencies to incorporate those amendments in the bill because I think they strengthen the bill and they certainly don't weaken it.
9881	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	yac6fvHb9_4	1197	1230	And there were drones that were an impediment or challenge, so this is I think a letter that was sent to, that was provided to all of us will be made a part of this record so that issue which I think we're not going to have time to really discuss in detail can be presented  that in fact you have experienced other drones who are not there for purposes of fighting the fire or having a constructive purpose within what your responsibilities are
9882	McGuire	Mike	93	0yf1SfBcDOs	1726	1736	Thank you so much, Mr. Chair and I do appreciate the comments by Mr. Hertzberg. Very eloquent and also appreciate the commitment that Mr. Vidak has related to transportation.
9883	Fuller	Jean	49	c9mBAjkLpP8	1801	1829	And, I went to Boron and I saw they have like, I don't know, their population is, I mean at a stretch 2000. And it's in the middle of the desert. There's nothing around it, there's not even any trees. And, that was where they taxed for their for that half the school district. Then I went to Edwards, which was the other half of their school district and it's nothing but federal land. There's nothing but sage brush. There was nothing to tax.
9884	Roth	Richard	106	SvIBnS8_PpY	2076	2092	And then depending on the outcome, one side or the other, given the size of the magnitude of the problem is undoubtedly going to appeal. And in California, in part because we don't fund additional judges, your appeal may last two to three or more years.
9885	Stone	Jeff	26	6q5JSfST1YQ	1803	1823	Distracted drivers have been the cause of numerous accidents in California and has had serious if not fatal consequences. As the Officer of Traffic Safety mentioned and as noted in your committee analysis, 80% of vehicle crashes involve some sort of driver inattention.
9886	Stone	Jeff	26	pvvkVbDJBVE	958	979	Thank you, Madame President. I think one of the finest rewards that we can give anyone coming before us for an appointment is validating their reappointment. I know that Mr. Henning has been a very important contributor at EDD, which as you know has been backloged with a lot of claims.  Mr. Henning has done an outstanding job of reducing those claims. I stand humbly before you today to support his appointment.
9887	Hertzberg	Robert	99	UAhBnrBfz1o	1678	1695	That's why I like to bury it in the financing where it gets into the rate. You sign a contract with Met or with some other water provider, their costs are higher, and the ultimate cost of the water is less than what you're paying today. It makes perfect sense, and it doesn't make people feel bad about their government, you know?
9888	Stone	Jeff	26	6q5JSfST1YQ	1775	1790	Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Beall, members, I'm honored to be here before you today. First off, I would like to take the suggested amendments in the committee analysis as author amendments and to thank you and your staff for all their hard work on this bill.
9889	Stone	Jeff	26	6q5JSfST1YQ	1790	1802	SB 737 is an attempt to make our roads safer for all Californians. California has been at the forefront when it comes to tackling the issues of talking and texting on ones cellphone while driving.
9890	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	DPeb4bLxnpo	1696	1718	First of all, I wanna thank you for taking what sound like some very immediate and, and intelligent, thoughtful steps. I have a couple questions dealing with the fact that the water law in California is either a mess or non-existent, generally speaking.
9891	Bonta	Rob	85	0LdXFnPqPCk	752	768	Mr. Speaker and members, on behalf of the Asian and Pacific-Islander legislative caucus, I rise in strong support of HR 10 to honor the peaceful civil rights protesters who marched in Selma, Alabama in 1965, fighting for the right to vote.
9892	De Leon	Kevin	102	uBO-fu4onZs	1557	1568	Thank you very much Madam Vice Chair. It may have slipped me, and I may not have heard it, but the current IT projects that you have, the vendors are Sagitech and CGI? That's correct?
9893	De Leon	Kevin	102	8as6rPb5Xb0	768	789	But, it seems like in Long Beach, they figured out that we all have to speak with each other. And that we're getting kids who are simply not up to par at Long Beach State University. That instead of pointing fingers, we gotta figure out with our partners, K-12, how do we engage with each other? This is our criteria, these are our standards, what can we also do?
9894	Leyva	Connie	62	UpKpxYjD9F8	221	232	When-- you know, I think it's always interesting that whenever there's something that you know, the opposition doesn't like, the first thing we're going to throw out there is that costly retiree health care and higher wages.
9895	Hertzberg	Robert	99	6r30p-6PJFA	246	264	And both companies, as well as Sampra Energy, has entered into dozens of contracts to purchase solar wind, biofuels and other renewables to meet and proudly exceed, you'll hear them say, the renewable energy procurement requirements imposed on them by the RPS standard and other mandates this legislature adopted.
9896	Hernandez	Roger	37	Tqcxk8QJsXU	1175	1192	Our constituents who follow the original rules and go to an in network hospital, cannot afford to pay thousands of dollars when they think they did everything right, everything according to plan. Surprise medical bills are contributing to the growing problem of consumer medical debt, a significant personal bankruptcy in California and many of our households.
9897	Hernandez	Roger	37	Tqcxk8QJsXU	1192	1229	Consumers should not have to pay the price for the complicated relationships between Doctors, facilities, and health plans. We've heard the debate here on this table. It appears here on the floor that doctors and plans and hospitals are wrestling with this issue, but why should it be the consumers fault?
9898	Hertzberg	Robert	99	_NTagRCFfsc	263	271	We talked about in one of the earlier measures how much head room we still have. It was at 31, you actually have space for, before we have to. It was some number.
9899	Chau	Ed	116	0lsNxjB7bP8	137	151	And while some of the information collected is irrelevant to the business model the operate there can also be the collection of information that is not relevant and if used wrongly can be discriminatory and unfair.
9900	Thurmond	Tony	4	8VierCtyjb0	1179	1212	Okay. So, on this item staff recommends holding open the GDSP estimate and the BCP to allow for May revision updates. Staff also recommends that the subcommittee request the administration provide provisional language as part of the May revise if ALD has not yet been added to the recommended uniform screening panel by then. That limits the departments authority to use these funds only for the purposes of AB1559 and within the limits set forth in that statue. Finance?
9901	Hall	Isadore	1	CVYbaFO-ROE	1395	1416	And be able to assess and make appropriate changes if necessary so, to your credit we are being accountable with this piece of legislation by requiring it to come back to this body for assessment and review. All right, so it enjoys a do pass recommendation and who's moving? Mr. Glazer is moving the bill. Please call the rule.
9902	Frazier	Jim	114	Mfs9_24i5lo	1235	1244	And with that, you know, you get my undying support, I did vote for Mr. Boukenger's bill. And thank you for being so passionate about this and knowing your bill.
9903	Thurmond	Tony	4	3I7f3vKVAeA	1525	1538	I've heard colleagues talk about poverty and to say that energy costs being driven up are going to hurt poor people. I think about my own district. In my district, I represent some of the poorest folks in our state.
9904	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	3I7f3vKVAeA	1440	1469	I want to talk about what represents in my community, a truly working-class community that is affected everyday by the fact that our temperatures are rising, that global climate change is real, and that California has the opportunity to lead in this and not lead alone.
9905	Hernandez	Ed	103	9P0OZVf3kdQ	692	708	They're going to go after that particular amount and they're going to put a lien on their house and they're going to do it through their estate. The other problem that patients and consumers are having is finding out what that dollar amount is and this bill would address that.
9906	Pavley	Fran	104	_QWOBYYvqfo	1298	1310	Particularly Central Valley and, and the Los Angeles area cause we're non attainment areas under the Federal Clean Air Act and we stand to lose our gas tax if we don't do something about cleaning up the air.
9907	Bloom	Richard	2	mb2tyA5yp6Q	426	449	But the most popular paper terrorism tactics is the use of bogus liens or other documents to cloud title to property that's owed by victims. Whatever the ploy, the intended and actual result is serious legal and financial problems for those targeted; typically, judges, elected officials, law enforcement, and, at times, private individuals.
9908	Kim	Young	82	qON9ODKuy9g	695	732	Great. Thank you. Just make a comment that I know it is, as a public institution, it's our State's priority to keep tuition and fees low for students, so your request for funding augmentation is consistent with that, so I guess that's why you prefer or support Governor's Proposal. But I've also listened to LAO's recommendations.  So my request to you, you just mentioned that you did not necessarily agree with LAO's recommendation, but let me repeat.
9909	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	uaZYquORnnU	1287	1298	And here I am, I've been working on this measure. Well, I didn't know what to do with some of these things. And wouldn't it be great if they could go back to the place where they were purchased, assuming they're still in business?
9910	Lara	Ricardo	107	1VsIgdliTQw	216	231	Thank you, Madame President and members. SB4 builds upon the historic budget action to provide comprehensive medical coverage for all children in California regardless of immigration status. This modest investment in healthcare will be transformational in the lives of families and kids and we'll save dollars we're currently spending to provide limited care and overcrowded emergency rooms.
9911	Wieckowski	Bob	55	H8qQQkSchzo	131	153	It looks as though this institute's saying, look we're less than two and a half percent. So the legislation that we have before us today, SB 345 we'll create a standard definition of charity care. And update the community benefits requirements for nonprofit hospitals and n, non-profit multi-specialty clinics.
9912	Kim	Young	82	ytuWCZu3NdM	1432	1437	Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members. Today I have with me distinguished guests from the Korean-American community from up and down the states. As you can see I was making a little reference in my native tongue. There are about 40 to 50 of them joining me in the gallery.
9913	Mitchell	Holly	64	4_9XuAIhx8I	1030	1052	Well, and I think the reality is that's why we're gonna have California Department of Healthcare Services here March 19. Because as I understand it, they are the drivers in terms of the system design. CalHEERS does what Healthcare Services tells them to do. So she's the- Process the- The mechanic. If you will. In terms of, you tell me what needs to be fixed.
9914	Allen	Benjamin	70	VxnkQM8e4Ho	1582	1605	And I'm hearing from small business owners who are just so concerned about mobility. And the quality of life and helping to move cities like Los Angeles and some of our other urban centers into the modern era with regards to decent pubic transit options and rail options is just so important and something that I'm really gonna be wanting to focus on.
9915	Mitchell	Holly	64	A1UTGLmNv2E	2502	2523	Ris joined THE in 2009, after holding many executive management positions in both public and private healthcare sectors. Her coming to THE was a true transition into THE's development as a non profit organization and she had expanded to over nine additional clinics in that short period of time.
9916	Mitchell	Holly	64	MTWW-DN4Tdo	1750	1769	Moving on to our last item, Adult Protective Services within the Department of Social Services. Item 1 APS Position codification. The recommendation is to adopt as proposed, and that is out with a 3 to 0 recommendation.
9917	Grove	Shannon	77	-Bv1QTsnUc8	1098	1113	But, not limit the opportunities for parents, like the witness that testified today, or the one that testified last year on a domestic violence and abusive situation that was able to move her family to a contiguous county and still continue their children's education.
9918	Thurmond	Tony	4	2OGvNLWw5B0	69	81	Most importantly, it will create the opportunity to support job creation and to support small businesses for the people of Richmond and for people who want to invest in many residual businesses that will take place in the city.
9919	Mitchell	Holly	64	A1UTGLmNv2E	2482	2502	THE was founded over four decades ago by Sylvia Drew Ivy the great-granddaughter of Charles Drew. For many years THE clinic was one of the only freestanding clinics up operating comprehensive women's health care and family care to a community on that historically has been disenfranchised and has had limited access to healthcare services.
9920	Thurmond	Tony	4	LTEBLbyRjnQ	2180	2201	And so I'm sympathetic to the argument that if we're gonna allow exemptions that there should be some involvement from someone who is affiliated either with the school or somehow has been through whatever processes should be in place to ensure that the program fits within a designed program.
9921	Hancock	Loni	98	a6D1KFF96cc	515	541	As always, the court will renew, review, and approve or deny any petition. So again, SB 196 will only apply when an elder asks for assistance or when the agency is confident enough that the individual has impaired ability to understand the harm he or she is in, and a conservator is being sought.
9922	Hancock	Loni	98	HIRi6UQEJmc	567	592	It's very hard to figure out what are the things we need to do. To go back to Mr. Monning's question, I was thinking when you said national legislation, well, California tries to be out in front in a lot of areas. And if Vermont has actually done something like this, that's a real thing that we should think about doing.
9923	Thurmond	Tony	4	LTEBLbyRjnQ	2201	2214	And I'm sure that there are fantastic people who are coaches of Rodeo. I'm not calling into question anybody's character, but it makes sense to me that there would be the structural considerations for how P.E. happens.
9924	Bonta	Rob	85	eSyz0S9hgyk	431	443	Welcome and congratulations, Dr. Smith. I just wanted to tell you that I'm looking forward to working with you. I'm honored to be the chair of the assembly health committee in addition to being on this important subcommittee. We have a one-on-one meeting later this week. I'm very much looking forward to that,
9925	Bloom	Richard	2	x4d8DYXm7og	1127	1150	Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Our law is out-of-date in the way that it sets limits on the allowable weight of a public transit bus. I've had calls from even a constituent named Bob Cats, in fact, on this. The decade old law that we have conflicts with some of our, thank you, more modern goals and laws, some of you are paying attention, that also
9926	Campos	Nora	76	QFffajW9pIQ	219	252	In 1989, farm workers for the Ace Tomato Company voted to have the United Farm Workers represent them. However, Ace Tomatoe refused to negotiate new employment terms with the United Farm Workers. Because of this and the challenges at the agricultural labor relation board, six hundred farm workers have not received any back pay or benefits to this day.
9927	Gatto	Mike	46	Sai1lZPOK9g	932	950	And in the United States it dates back from the seminal Second Circuit decision with Judge Learned Hand, and I believe that the US versus Carroll Towing decision. So that standard we think is the best one. Business have been using it for decades now. They're familiar with it.
9928	Wolk	Lois	94	w3XqiN30Dys	2124	2142	But I think in terms of reestablishing or renovating or rehabilitating parks, I think what's really, it's important to do that because it's a similar kind of issue. It may not be an underserved area, but it may well be an area that can no longer afford to rehabilitate the parks that are there.
9929	Fuller	Jean	49	162iDtQT3ZE	968	982	The Bay Area MCT report their call boxes have declined by more than 90 percent, to average less than one call per box a month. And LA MTA reports calls have declined about 70 percent.
9930	Beall	Jim	92	rSN8XCdpbf8	1361	1376	And then we estimate that shelters, like if these youth are in shelters, it's about 40, and all the services they get, young people in the shelters, when they're 18, we're talking like $40,000 a year per person.
9931	De Leon	Kevin	102	SxRX-lKXiDU	1554	1573	That being said, also at the same time we know is one of the biggest emitters of pollution in the air and has really high impact. On the public health of children. Particularly children who live in or around that corridor.
9932	Leno	Mark	60	07ilphfHuEw	220	237	It also specifies timing changes for reports for the CSU Director of nursing practice degree pilot program in the CSU early start program report. It also makes the San Mateo County childcare subsidy plan, finally.
9933	Medina	Jose	81	wK5CwGDTeOM	121	134	I rise in support of this bill. As a classroom teacher for 34 years, I saw too many kids not have time to eat lunch and throw their food away, so very much recommend an aye vote.
9934	Hancock	Loni	98	Ms6-wag6WJY	95	124	A minimum of two public meetings will be held, so that standards can be submitted to the board on or before January 31, 2018 and adopted before July 18th. Implementation is contingent upon both the board adopting a schedule to the regular update of academic content standards, as well as the legislature appropriating funds for the purpose.
9935	Garcia	Cristina	112	UmXyuczgH_s	1835	1845	I don't have an analysis of how this will be all impacted, and how we find that sweet spot, but I think they're points are very valid, and my goal is to create something that's better for everyone involved.
9936	Gatto	Mike	46	oWaFMHsMqpI	1139	1161	And that means and mechanism, of course is a speeding car traveling on an artery that can get that person away from the scene in a very very quick rate of speed. This bill is targeted and it does something meaningful, which is it will put a message on that artery, so that if someone sees someone weaving through traffic on that freeway, you might assume that person's late for work.
9937	Mayes	Chad	79	Yh01GevItcE	1164	1180	He's been here for seven months as well. And the impacts of the Salton Sea are great on his district. And he wasted no time when he got here to make sure that as a member of this governing board, that our eyes and ears and our hands were gonna begin working on this.
9938	Allen	Benjamin	70	xL36G7ytN6U	1442	1457	Between 1% and 8% of California's 35 million cars and light trucks are unregistered. Unregistered vehicles pollute at higher rates compared to the average vehicle in California and compared to registered vehicles of the same make and model
9939	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	xbFtMrlj2T4	1446	1461	We have a motion by Senator Moorlach I don't think Senator Wieckowski wants the bill. It's motion, due pass as amended to the Senate floor. Please call the roll.
9940	Gipson	Mike	28	iTxXE4wvZH4	1209	1222	Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. This information certainly has been enlightening for me as a new member and freshman assembly member. A couple questions. How many card rooms have you had to close down?
9941	Cannella	Anthony	61	IQPza6hTge0	1142	1157	Expanding the prime program will increase the number of students who can be admitted and provide a long term pipeline of physicians that understand the need for access to quality health care in the valley With me today I have a few of the students in the SJV prime program are going to testify.
9942	Beall	Jim	92	GE9yKeDoFKQ	1423	1438	This is a district bill, a pilot project in Alum Rock School District in San Jose, and first I'd like to accept the Committee amendments in the Committee analysis. Thank you everybody for working with us on these amendments.
9943	Thurmond	Tony	4	_b18tzFsHIo	1406	1419	I too rise in support of AB 329. Simply to say this, that this bill is respectful to the right of parents to really talk with their families but in spite of that, there is just a fact that young people still are often misinformed.
9944	Pavley	Fran	104	rXqXXOdeL9w	590	601	In fact, several counties are already doing this to allow, in a safe place, a vote by mail drop-off box. Perhaps in your city hall or in your library.
9945	Fuller	Jean	49	WnmFSvHbO0k	161	182	Well I hope we keep this great spirit going forward. Mr. President and members, I rise to present to you SB 111 which will assist 11 public schools on or near military installations throughout California who have already qualified for Department of Defense school construction grant by helping them fund their 20% match requirement.
9946	Monning	Bill	25	81AHHgExKGE	73	89	This bill does not seek to cast aspersions on these plans, or cast them as villains. Instead it acknowledges when adequate protections and oversight can benefit consumers, and possibly lead to better outcomes for patients.
9947	Mullin	Kevin	31	m6dFsAKXJbs	8	20	Good morning. The Assembly is now in session. Assemblymember Holden notices the absence of a quorum. The sergeant-at-arms will prepare the chamber and bring in the absent members. The clerk will call the roll.
9948	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	Idhs0np0fh0	834	856	I'd just like to close by suggesting that this bill is about due process for ratepayers. It's unconscionable to think that on top of paying for inadequacies and safety violations that the ratepayers are required to shoulder, like we have with SONGS, that then on top of that, we're being expected to pay for not the base salary.
9949	Dodd	Bill	71	-f1YeZDeFao	115	126	If we get through the end, and we don't have one of these big reservoirs done or two of them done, people are gonna say, "You guys just blew that money," and look at it, the projects are honorable.
9950	Leno	Mark	60	alaNgMhEeC8	209	225	One example is that it will reduce the number of individuals eligible for Medi-Cal by about 440,000, saving the state an estimated $615 million to about $755 million just in Medi-Cal costs alone.
9951	Irwin	Jacqui	16	qyjOsnncZ4w	821	845	Sounds like an extraordinary service and hopefully we will make sure that all state agencies address their vulnerabilities and critical infrastructure and when you're talking about LEX and ports, it's very important that they're able to address their issues too. So, do we have anything else? Boy, thank you very much. That was great information.
9952	Chavez	Rocky	83	J9HsD1Cp56U	799	827	And as you eluded to as far as your nurses, the cost of a quality CTE program. You know with Prop 30 sunsetting, wondering how 98's going to do as far as the economy of California. I'm hopeful it'll go up. All people elected like to see the economy go up. But, I'm wondering, what do you think the growth of the future of CTE programs in your community college?
9953	Stone	Jeff	26	YKXU5BUfkbE	1705	1716	Is it gonna provide equal opportunities for al these kids? Or is it gonna be pretty much, if you live in a metropolitan area with a large school district, they're gonna get the big chunk of funding at the expense of smaller districts?
9954	Nielsen	Jim	68	zPn0btnMxJg	389	412	General Wong, I've had to deal with some emergency situations but nothing like what nurses have to in the military, men and women. And I can only imagine what it's like to look in those eyes whenever you see the fear or in these situations. There's a post traumatic stress syndrome for you, right?
9955	De Leon	Kevin	102	A4tFO9bb3f0	1533	1545	Okay, fantastic. Now let's go to an ambitious goal that the Governor set forth at his State of the State speech, that the Senate is trying to execute through policy.
9956	Hertzberg	Robert	99	r2CpJ7yeI28	835	854	So, what do you do? And that's why what we do here is so damn important and why the homework is so damn important, because when we don't get it right, it's just a lawyer's full employment act, and a lobbyist's full employment act, and our job is to do great policy so these guys can go out and take care of their kids.
9957	Vidak	Andy	56	1ddkqgmLsnY	1016	1033	Yeah, but this resolution is asking Congress to get their act together. I didn't put, you know, didn't list, we want people here in California, we don't want their families broken up and we want Congress get their act together along with the President.
9958	Beall	Jim	92	HGSgNV57aUQ	1831	1855	It's gone on and on and on and to say that we should sit back and say the regular process is appropriate, is inappropriate for taking care of the safety and protection of these young people that are trying to learn. And I think that we ought to approve his bill. Give it a chance, if we have to tweak it later, we can come back and tweak it later.
9959	Pavley	Fran	104	RdbGbgsSaLY	983	1003	If we get this right and the report is done correctly, it opens up the opportunity for use of greenhouse gas emission funds which is the goal. So you get a double win if you will reduce energy consumption plus get into water conservation projects, especially during these times of drought.
9960	Hernandez	Ed	103	LYOrqHadQ70	98	112	And, what we're seeing, at least the data showing that there's a point six one percent decrease in the PBE's, so I believe that that bill was doing what it needed to do to solve that problem.
9961	Ridley-Thomas	Sebastian	67	Wq4BKtQGDbc	17	36	So you can't do more with less. There's no such thing that I'm aware of and that's a part of the delay also. Mail boxes in some communities may still as is but in large portions of the area that I represent are no longer outside on corners in the same distributions.
9962	Chavez	Rocky	83	y1QKa01q6Wg	1875	1901	So, the buying of Covered California, for that group, how has that been going as far as buying, even buying into the program of Covered California? [INAUDIBLE] I have my expert. I was wondering, she's been feeding you all the answers for a while. I'm just trying to help. I'd just say, well, ask the lady to your left.
9963	Mathis	Devon	75	QoWDHxezaEY	95	114	Illegal dumping is hazardous to the environment. Refrigerators, tires, auto parts and televisions contain heavy metals and other toxins which can contaminate air, ground, and waterways, they also pose fire hazards. Illegal dumping piles also pose traffic hazards when left in the public right of way.
9964	De Leon	Kevin	102	BHYxE3t9U1s	289	305	Thank you. Thank you so much, Ms. Brown. Anyone else? Okay. Okay I'm seeing then, I have to ask, any opposition? No opposition. Anyone who's agnostic? Saying then again,  thank you very much and congratulations once again. Thank you.
9965	Monning	Bill	25	iTrvWXqiedk	1585	1615	I don't know if there's a way they could be better placed or better designed. But again I'm all for improving the use of these for their purpose which is to protect primarily pedestrians, but also people may be on bikes or other vehicles. So, I'm gonna stop there and just listen.
9966	Patterson	Jim	119	b_pUZDCcfig	799	810	Medicare and Medicaid allow for the enrollment and reimbursement of radiologists regardless of their location in the United States, as long as they are licensed in the state where the beneficiary resides.
9967	Pan	Richard	96	2V6gzfYtqAs	551	573	That's not true. I mean, you could, I guess through a lot of work, but it's not gonna be very easy to get. A DNA profile on a child without a lot of people giving permission in between to get there. So, I just want to be very careful about how we're presenting this.
9968	Pan	Richard	96	Smx7pNnpEJQ	1439	1459	Is there existing law that requires some kind of sharing or disclosure of those types of transactions and to the overseeing educational body for the charter school? Just because certainly, I understand that board members are doing this for the benefit and maybe at their own loss.
9969	Chau	Ed	116	0lsNxjB7bP8	2244	2256	I think we will agree to continue the dialogue with all the members of the, of the committee and also from the tech industry to, you know, make further changes to make sure that it's a workable solution. So I, I believe that this is a good start.
9970	Gomez	Jimmy	80	2b3SgDbb8jI	696	710	That was a rhetorical question. But thank you so much. We have a motion by Bigelow, a second by Quirk. This bill's out on a nay roll call. Thank you so much Miss Burke. Mr. Harper.
9971	Morrell	Mike	51	GIcgVGMKBjg	1909	1929	Thank you, Madame Chair and members. Just quickly imagine we're spending $1 billion of taxpayers' money today with virtually no public notice of course and no transparency with even little notice to our body with a budget meeting just a couple of short hours ago.
9972	McCarty	Kevin	22	l3Ffe0dfTvk	17	32	Will, wo, wo, whats the timeline? When's it gonna be agendized on the Regents agenda? Cuz it's a real issue and, effecting potentially $40 million every year for, for decades. And that is impact to the state of California and the UC system.
9973	Mitchell	Holly	64	vuTgADMvFlA	276	295	And so, I think it would be important as maybe in the context of the budget ghat we look back historically to see if there's any specific correlation, 'cause clearly the legislature has expressed its desire, and it seems logical to us.
9974	Weber	Shirley	44	xusZRk9gg60	865	883	We believe in transparency. The money is there. People ask, how much does my district get? Where are they spending it? Who are they spending it on? And that becomes important if we're going to continue to have a public belief that there's some logic behind the funding of the system that we have that sometimes appears to be very complicated.
9975	Roth	Richard	106	fsCa0C45gN0	921	941	But for some time this list has been, I call it, sort of an opt-out situation, with the person of belief exception, you can opt out of getting one or more of the vaccines on the list, so aside from measles, which has been of some interest in the media and otherwise, was there some triggering event
9976	Brown	Cheryl	13	JxVz04W1qRk	152	181	So what do we need to do to make that happen, because right now, it's creating confusion between the county, the state, and all of the efforts that are supposed to be going forward. How long do you see it happening and when can we come to some kind of place that we can help in that place? What can we do to help?
9977	Chiu	David	7	TPSat3Z_tD4	1504	1523	and their sperm donors are at risk being required to pay child support. AB 960 provides equal protection for these two kinds of families, for unmarried parents using assisted reproduction as well as parents using known donors who use at home insemination and don't go through a Doctor. Also AB 960 provides
9978	Thurmond	Tony	4	UMlpaC9VCt4	892	916	AB 1496 would take this work a step further to specifically look at methane throughout all sectors in California. We're working to reduce costs on this bill, but because SB 605 is already in implementation, we believe that this bill can be moved forward in a way that is very cost effective and minimizes impact to the state's general fund.
9979	Hadley	David	40	y0sIqVkPves	1402	1426	62%, pardon me, and private insurance was 11 or so, and can you speak to whether that's talking about, is the denominator the population or is it money spent? Where does family care, informal care fit in to this and, are you talking about money or lives with those numbers?
9980	Weber	Shirley	44	EupEjx01Yv8	835	846	Thank you. We have one last bill I guess AB 854 which is our foster youth service bill, that deals with our local control funding formula and definition alignment.
9981	Pavley	Fran	104	oc8zggZcgHM	724	740	Could you articulate his vision in that regard? There's a lot of interest throughout the state and making those connections between relevant jobs in a particular region and providing an educated workforce.
9982	McCarty	Kevin	22	sx5Murt3em4	821	836	Okay, we will reconvene on this, on this hearing in the panel on admin and personnel costs. Do we have comments or questions from committee members on this section?
9983	Nguyen	Janet	65	LFikd5rYakY	230	254	Thank you, Madam President. I want to thank the great Senator from Long Beach for putting forward this resolution, and I am here to support it. Colleagues, for those of you, you already know that I was one of those refugees. Last week, or actually couple weeks ago, when we saw those children, those lifeless bodies on those beaches,
9984	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	yhx1NvxzAgA	56	70	Those bills are on the consent calendar. We will turn to the, to our daily file, our agenda. It looks like we have a quorum. So I'm gonna go ahead and establish a quorum.
9985	Nguyen	Janet	65	LFikd5rYakY	254	292	for me, it was so tearful because those bodies- Thank you, Madam President. Because that one child could have been me. Over 30 years ago, I was three-years-old crossing the Great China Sea with my family, and those children do not deserve what is going on today. Our country is a great country. Today we celebrate and thank the heroes and the victims of September 11th. When my brother went to Iraq,
9986	Olsen	Kristin	15	_gd0KmtJp10	720	742	Thank you Mr. Speaker, it is with sadness and sympathy for my community of Modesto that I adjourn in the memory of David Gear, who passed away very suddenly on December 28th, at the age of 72. I had the pleasure of serving with Dave for my last year, and his first-year on the Modesto City Council, and I'll always consider myself blessed for the year we were able to serve our community together as friends and colleagues.
9987	Jones	Brian	42	D-fVk6CkUDE	1616	1633	Today I'm presenting AB 921, which will require the establishment of a disciplinary review committee, also known as a DRC, which a licensed private investigator could voluntarily opt into to to contest the assessment of an administrative fine, or to appeal a denial of a license.
9988	Hancock	Loni	98	7wM-SWUAGJQ	184	226	I want to stress. This is not a grant of parole. It is not a mandate for parole. It is an opportunity for a parole hearing after 15, 20, or 25 years in state prison. It allows the board of parole hearings 11 of the 12 of which have law enforcement background to consider the remorse, maturity, and rehabilitation of the individuals and it is also subject to the review of the Governor, who may approve or deny.
9989	De Leon	Kevin	102	tF8-OuIBF-8	0	15	You have a newly appointed position, Assistant Director for Environmental Justice that is Ana Mascareas. How do you plan to work with her? This is a newly appointed position that's never existed within DTSC.
9990	Nielsen	Jim	68	Q9Mn4k8Lves	507	531	Now you don't take that as a personal affront necessarily, we're used to arrogance, but that arrogance does not serve the people of California whose children and students, adult students, attend our community colleges. And they do not profit by an unfair and arbitrary way of administering and accrediting.
9991	Dababneh	Matthew	50	w8nI6ofQavM	906	918	And they're really pillars of our community and I applaud all these public institutions for the work they do. And I will support them in any way I can. I'm a product of these institutions. I would not be here today for not the work of these institutions.
9992	Vidak	Andy	56	1ddkqgmLsnY	584	596	Our current immigration system is not seen any major changes for over twenty-five years. Patchwork attempts have been attempted to amend its deficiencies but have failed to address the major problems.
9993	Hall	Isadore	1	Xjq2sHgkTwU	1238	1260	This is asking for probation officers to be exempt from hardcore criminal trials, where people are doing bad things and this pocket of professionals have to manage that each and every day on the street. Criminals, each and every day.
9994	Wolk	Lois	94	BllaAgaiebY	600	611	Let's do that. Yes. That would be just for item 13. Just for item 13, we will reduce the amount by 1,000 and that automatically puts it into conference.
9995	Daly	Tom	118	1fxZCVj9XoA	1198	1212	Providers of professional services currently such as chiropractors, masseuses, or physical therapists who sexually assault their clients during the course of a treatment session are usually charged with felony-- sex crimes.
9996	Leno	Mark	60	HENRPUI3nxY	679	698	So if I could please continue. I'm really concerned, I don't know where they got their misinformation. From what I heard, this bill is going to close down vape shops. What I heard is this bill is going to require that those who are still addicted to nicotine who are now getting it through their vaping will have to go back to smoking cigarettes.
9997	Block	Marty	59	EWFYx7q92DQ	1572	1585	California Asian-Pacific Chamber of Commerce, California Black Chamber of Commerce, California Disabled Veterans' Business Alliance and others. I have representatives here from the bill's cosponsors to testify in support and answer any questions committee members might have.
9998	Atkins	Toni	110	yGdC7D9fPQ8	1485	1502	We have the opportunity again today to be one state, but I want, you know, just to address the issue raised by my colleague and the Republican leader, we have a process in place right now. It's called the Administrative Procedures Act.
9999	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	Fotikfq9Ybo	1418	1437	Thank you very much. I know you're doing a lot of very exciting work there, and I also wanted to ask as my final question: in developing all these fascinating technologies, is there any discussion about the safety aspects?
10000	Bonilla	Susan	3	ik8_Xx3XS1w	134	153	And this mentorship program is a way to achieve that goal. But the last person in the world to pay, should be that brand new teacher, who is just out of pocket for a whole fifth year in their credential program where they've basically been working for free in the classroom as a student teacher.
10001	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	JX3K3k4qzkE	1029	1044	Well, it explains the sort-of construct of this program. I'm kind of interested seriously in the alternative fuel market and some of it's actually very innovative. I suspect some of it's very helpful and some of it isn't and I'm just wondering...
10002	Williams	Das	12	dQgHkZmLQFo	359	390	Moved by Mr. Wood. I will second it. Any comments from the committee? The bill does four things now including monitoring and measuring methane hot spots. And wanted to make sure that folks know doing a lifecycle GHG emission analysis of natural gas production, update GHG emission factors for natural gas generation and transportation, and review the science on atmospheric reactivity of methane as an ozone precursor.
10003	Lara	Ricardo	107	vUWGQO4sF_w	1765	1782	Thank you. Questions or comments from committee? Say now. Without objection, we move this bill to the suspense file. SB 591. Witnesses in support. Witnesses in opposition. Finance? Without objection, we move this item to the suspense file.
10004	Quirk	Bill	23	4XOeWVTUKok	517	534	Okay, so they wouldn't be in PL? Correct. Alright so, I'm recommending an aye, for the reasons stated by the author, that the Police Chief would know best. Also, certainly in a county the size of LA.
10005	Chu	Kansen	32	mYMmmzreoTQ	808	829	And I just wanted to also let the Chair know that the new freshman class has a three o'clock mandatory training so I don't know how many of us will have to leave around three. So I just wanted to excuse myself.
10006	Leno	Mark	60	ZhE_hzRecAQ	1535	1555	So to have a system that will link voter registration to only those who can get a full driver's license means we don't have to worry about the integrity of the system and at the same time, provide an easier path to get involved with the electoral process.
10007	Wieckowski	Bob	55	UxOY7iYteD0	834	853	I've been to one of these big tent events where you have...It's amazing how many people show up there and I'm trying to understand, where do the students fit in? Cuz it seems like they're people, the dentists are shoulder to shoulder with I guess the people in the clinic can, have patients...
10008	Mathis	Devon	75	KbV7aq9eFHo	28	53	All right. I will, echo the comments of my colleague Mr. Daly and just say this is a great, great accountability piece and I was really pleased to read about that. You know, the, you put the minimum standard so that we're focusing on outcomes and making sure that veterans are getting the services that they need, so Mr. Frasier I commend you on that. And with that I'd like to either motion or add a second motion to support the bill.
10009	Hancock	Loni	98	r722a4Ml8Ec	426	457	The 7.50 isn't per hour. Per day, per student. And in the interest of really looking at the whole child, of taking care of our kids so that they succeed in school. So we can put a stop to any cycling of young people through our criminal justice system.
10010	Lackey	Tom	10	hxZ4kK3mSXo	20	41	I know we're all very busy and I respect your time, and I'm very appreciative of you spending your time with me here to hear this. This proposal. For the record, it should be known that I do not support recreational marijuana. However, I'm honored to present this joint resolution, which is Assembly Joint Resolution 25.
10011	Hertzberg	Robert	99	_rncMVWCV9g	1222	1236	Can I just add something? Cuz I think you said this exactly right, but I just want to build off of one of the comments that you made, which I think is exactly on the money and it is when you have all these siloed entities. They are all experts at hiring lawyers and accountants and lobbyists, everybody to protect their interests.
10012	Gonzalez	Lorena	53	-v-krVjWW-I	2093	2114	We can't talk about job quality. We can't talk about parks. We can't talk about living wages. We can't talk about anything, except how that structure's going to look. I think we owe it to my residents, the places that Civic San Diego ex, hopes to expand, into areas of the 80th assembly district in City Heights and in Campo to allow them to have a voice in the process.
10013	Monning	Bill	25	SyoQEeEJfIE	664	683	And, and then when the adjustment is a full year, that seems excessive.  And again, understanding the delay with the director. I know one was in place and then due to personal reasons, as you mentioned, that was obviously a setback not forseeable.
10014	Jackson	Hannah-Beth	100	QnBcTK-as8k	847	862	Thank you. Well, in honor of the fact that yesterday was Mother's Day and hopefully all of us had the opportunity, either as mothers or having mothers or grandmothers or what have you, an opportunity to celebrate mother's yesterday.
10015	Hancock	Loni	98	KNTNNHrdr9E	837	860	take advantage of some of the new college opportunities we're making available. We do have to make sure, we want their parents to work. We need to make sure that we are realizing what an important part these programs are of our seamless efforts to support the next generation.
10016	Perea	Henry	33	Hfoe3X0tet8	928	940	This bill would assure low income communities have access to low carbon fueling infrastructure, such as bio-diesel and renewable diesel, that will provide immediate measurable reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.
10017	Leno	Mark	60	J-efxTqVOiQ	529	549	So, we'll begin on page one. And before we start with the Office of Systems Integration, LAO, if you wanna just give us a brief overview of Health and Human Services please.
10018	Grove	Shannon	77	maPB0VHfdFQ	1135	1155	You know, just last week, as my colleague said, we passed the transparency bill about government being transparent and more open-to-the-public, but yet these empty vehicles with nothing in them but a simple statement about an act to enact budget or budget act for this period of time years is just going to be pasture with no actual language in it.
10019	Mitchell	Holly	64	FHGwb8kBog8	2232	2245	This seems to me to be the one data point that we'll have, both the health department, all of the departments who are feeding into it, as well as legislators. So I'm looking forward to it and am proud to move the nomination, thank you.
